        "text": "<MASK> : the scene pictured above was captured by charlotte observer photographer patrick schneider during a house fire in july 1999 and shows firefighter jeff clark receiving a doggie greeting from a pregnant red doberman named cinnamon . as the observer described the circumstances behind the photograph in an april 2005 retrospective : <PARA> charlotte firefighter jeff clark and cinnamon , a pregnant red doberman , gained international exposure with this photograph snapped by the observer \u2019 s patrick schneider during a july 1999 house fire . seen through wire services and the internet , the picture has moved people around the world and is still a top reprint seller . <PARA> however , the text that now accompanies e - mailed versions of the photograph is inaccurate in suggesting that cinnamon was \u201c thanking \u201d firefighter clark for saving her life \u201c by carrying her out of the house into her front yard .\u201d as clark himself explained , he didn \u2019 t rescue the dog , and his encounter with her was pure happenstance : <PARA> we didn \u2019 t do anything ( special ) to save cinnamon . when we have a house fire , we have to do a primary search . there could be people home and inside . our first major concern is life safety . that house was full of smoke and we couldn \u2019 t see it very well . all i saw was a dog run out , and one was ( already ) in the backyard . i think cinnamon got out the door herself . <PARA> the dog approached me . as soon as i knelt down and took my mask off , patrick was coming around the corner of the house and took the picture . <PARA> the dog approached me . as soon as i knelt down and took my mask off , patrick was coming around the corner of the house and took the picture . <PARA> jeff clark is still with the charlotte fire department . cinnamon eventually gave birth to five puppies and lived for several more years until she passed away in january 2005 .",

        "text": "a video of a chimpanzee memorizing and quickly remembering the location of numbers on a screen has been appearing on social media since at least 2013 , along with text that suggests no human is capable of performing this task : <PARA> the video is a portion of a lecture given by professor tetsuro matsuzawa of kyoto university \u2019 s primate research institute at the 2013 meeting of the american association for the advancement of science , or aaas . <PARA> matsuzawa and his colleagues have published numerous peer - reviewed studies based on this and similar experimental setups , and have been conducting experiments similar to the one shown in the above video since 1978 . the project ( named \u201c the ai project \u201d after the <MASK> chimpanzee subject ), focuses on \u201c the perceptual and cognitive capabilities of chimpanzees rather than communicative skills between humans and chimpanzees .\u201d <PARA> for much of its existence , the primary investigator has been dr . tetsuro matsuzawa . some of this work is conducted in the form of single - subject testing of both chimps and humans at a computer terminal , where a variety of visual memory and cognitive tests are administered . <PARA> a 2013 paper written by matsuzawa summarized the methodology and findings of the decades - long project : <PARA> the young chimpanzees performed better in terms of speed and accuracy than both their own mothers and human adults . ayumu , the most skilled participant , can do the task with nine numerals at 5 . 5 - year old , with a latency of 0 . 67 seconds to touch the first number and a level of accuracy above 80 percent , which cannot be achieved by human subjects even if they are trained for an extended period of time . <PARA> the ability for juvenile chimpanzees to outperform both humans and older peers led matsuzawa and others to propose that a chimp \u2019 s remarkable photographic ( eidetic ) memory compared to humans represents an evolutionary tradeoff between visual memory and language : <PARA> it is important to note , however , that chimpanzees , as a whole , did not outperform humans . the 2007 research paper that provided these initial results tested three mother - offspring pairs against the performance of seven university student volunteers . adult chimpanzees did not outperform humans , and the most impressive results came from just one of the juveniles named ayumu . <PARA> other researchers have argued that the methodology does not allow for a <MASK> comparison of memory between humans and chimpanzees , because chimps had extensive practice and training learning the mechanics of the experiment while human participants did not . responding to a 2010 science feature that highlighted matsuzawa \u2019 s work , university of california , santa cruz psychology professors peter cook and margaret wilson penned a letter published in a later issue of that journal : <PARA> the study cook and wilson cite was written by alan silberberg and david kearns , both professors of psychology at american university in washington , d . c . in this study , the two authors replicated the methods of the ayuma study with themselves as participants . the main difference was that the authors allowed themselves more time to practice . they concluded that : <PARA> chimpanzees do indeed have have a surprisingly good ability to memorize the locations of sequential symbols , as shown in the video . what is less clear is how that ability compares to humans and , as a result , what this means for both human and chimpanzee cognitive development .",

        "text": "<MASK> : as the popularity of this e - mail attests , the fact that one can find a wide disparity in drug prices from one pharmacy to the next was apparently surprising news to many people . and there \u2019 s probably some truth to the notion that because we tend to view generic drugs as great \u201c money - saving \u201d alternatives to brand drugs , we often don \u2019 t consider that the mark - up on generics can vary widely from one retailer to the next . <PARA> the basic facts laid out in the message <MASK> above are <MASK> . steve wilson , a reporter with wxyz - tv in detroit , conducted an investigative study into the cost of generic drugs at various pharmacies and other retail drug outlets and found quite a disparity between the highest and lowest prices <PARA> charged for certain generic drugs . for example , the prescription drug price comparison chart available in conjunction with wilson \u2019 s report shows that a one - month supply of fluoxetine hcl ( the generic for prozac ), which wholesales for $ 1 . 48 , varied in retail price from a high of $ 92 . 24 to a low of $ 9 . 69 just within the detroit area . <PARA> comparison shopping applies to generic drugs just as much as it does to food , clothing , dvds , automobiles , or any other product . those willing to do some hunting around get the best prices , and many drug comparison sites are available on the web to help consumers compare the costs of various drugs at different retail outlets before submitting their prescriptions ( although medical insurance or hmo restrictions may limit which pharmacies a covered patient can use ). price differences between pharmacies can \u2019 t necessarily be chalked up to nothing more than mere greed , however \u2014 some pharmacies offer additional levels of service ( such as staying open 24 hours a day ) and have to recoup the costs of those additional services by charging higher prices . <PARA> although we can \u2019 t guarantee that costco always has the lowest prices on generic drugs , it is generally <MASK> that their pharmacy will fill prescriptions for non - members ( but be prepared to pay by cash or atm card rather than check ). <PARA> later versions of this message had the following table added to the beginning : <PARA> big rip - off <PARA> the cost of prescription drugs <PARA> did you ever wonder how much it costs a drug company for the active ingredient in prescription medications ? some people think it must cost a lot , since many drugs sell for more than $ 2 . 00 per tablet . we did a search of offshore chemical synthesizers that supply the active ingredients found in drugs approved by the fda . as we have revealed in past issues of life extension , a significant percentage of drugs sold in the united <MASK> contain active ingredients made in other countries . <PARA> in our independent investigation of how much profit drug companies really make , we obtained the actual price of active ingredients used in some of the most popular drugs sold in america . the chart below speaks for itself . <PARA> the cost of prescription drugs <PARA> did you ever wonder how much it costs a drug company for the active ingredient in prescription medications ? some people think it must cost a lot , since many drugs sell for more than $ 2 . 00 per tablet . we did a search of offshore chemical synthesizers that supply the active ingredients found in drugs approved by the fda . as we have revealed in past issues of life extension , a significant percentage of drugs sold in the united <MASK> contain active ingredients made in other countries . <PARA> in our independent investigation of how much profit drug companies really make , we obtained the actual price of active ingredients used in some of the most popular drugs sold in america . the chart below speaks for itself . <PARA> this chart is of dubious accuracy and has little relevance ( other than an inflammatory one ), as far more goes into the retail pricing of drugs than the raw cost of their active ingredients . pharmaceutical companies expend money on the research and development costs of creating the drugs , plus the overhead costs of manufacturing , marketing , and shipping them ; as well , pharmacies must sell drugs for more than their wholesale prices in order to cover the overhead costs of store operations ( including pharmacists \u2019 salaries ).",

        "text": "a viral list purportedly cataloging the nfl \u2019 s <MASK> on freedom of speech issues has been bouncing around the internet since at least september 2017 : <PARA> we have not been able to determine the author of this list . it is frequently shared as a block of text on online forums , and has also been printed in the \u201c letters to the editor \u201d sections of various newspapers : <PARA> the list first started circulating in the wake of a league - wide demonstration on 24 september 2017 , when more than 200 fooball players , coaches , and owners knelt or locked arms on the field in response to remarks made by president donald trump about peaceful protests by players during the u . s . national anthem : <PARA> outlets such as the new york post published op - eds arguing that the nfl has a double standard when it comes to freedom of speech issues as they seemingly supported these player \u2019 s rights to protest but had previously fined players for voicing support of other causes . an <MASK> in the conservative daily wire blog entitled , \u201c nfl \u2019 s free speech : kneeling for the anthem is fine , but fighting breast cancer and domestic violence ? shut up \u201d even mentioned several of the items that would be later included on this list : <PARA> ( it should be noted here that although the nfl briefly showed support in 2017 for the players protesting police brutality and social injustice during the national anthem , the league announced that players would be required to stand if they are on the field during the national anthem in 2018 .) <PARA> however , a major flaw in the argument is that every item on the \u201c nfl \u2019 s free speech <MASK> \u201d list deals with a violation of the league \u2019 s unusually strict strict uniform policy , while the kneeling protests during the national anthem do not . <PARA> regardless , here are the facts behind the items on this viral list . <PARA> in 2012 , the nfl had an issue with tim tebow kneeling for each game to pray and wearing bible verse messages . <PARA> mixture . although kneeling before football games has become associated with a form of protest , that wasn \u2019 t the case when tim tebow was an active member of the national football league . tebow , like many nfl players , would frequently kneel in prayer before games or after big plays . we found no record of the nfl having any issues with tebow \u2019 s kneeling , and as it was a common occurrence among players across the league , we doubt that they ever did . <PARA> the league did prevent tebow from wearing \u201c john 3 : 16 \u201d on his eye black , but the league wasn \u2019 t specifically singling out the quarterback or his religious <MORE> game conference in september 2014 he was wearing a shirt which read \u201c know jesus know peace .\u201d however , he turned this shirt inside out before he reached the podium . <PARA> a number of outlets reported at the time that the nfl had \u201c forced \u201d him to turn his shirt inside out . the <MASK> was even further exaggerated by outlets who argued that this incident showed that the nfl was anti - religion . both of these assertions , however , are incorrect . a redskins spokesperson at the time said that griffin did it voluntarily to avoid a potential fine . <PARA> although this shirt may have violated the league \u2019 s rules on personal messages , the washington post noted that the shirt also contained an unapproved logo . griffin , who had previously been fined twice by the nfl for wearing a non - approved logo on game days , would have normally changed into his post - game ( and league - approved ) attire before the press conference , but the quarterback was dealing with an injury at the time and decided to wear an informal ( and not approved ) outfit to the conference : <PARA> in 2015 , deangelo williams was fined for wearing \u201c find the cure \u201d eye black for breast cancer awareness . <PARA> <MASK> . deangelo williams was another play who ran afoul of the nfl \u2019 s uniform policies . in 2015 , he was fined for wearing pink in support of of breast cancer awareness : <PARA> in 2015 , william gay was fined for wearing purple cleats to raise awareness for domestic violence . <PARA> <MASK> . william gay was also fined by the nfl for breaking the league \u2019 s uniform policy . the pittsburgh steelers safety was fined $, 5787 ( the same amount as williams ) after he wore purple cleats : <PARA> in 2016 , the nfl prevented dallas cowboys players wearing decals on their helmets to honor five dallas police officers killed in the line of duty . <PARA> <MASK> . as should be abundantly clear by now , the national football league doesn \u2019 t often make exceptions to its dress code policy . in fact , when news outlets reported that the league was preventing the dallas cowboys from wearing decals in honor of five officers killed in the line of duty , they noted that decision was \u201c unsurprising \u201d: <PARA> in 2016 , the nfl threatened to fine players who wanted to wear cleats to commemorate the 15th anniversary of 11 september 2001 . <PARA> mostly <MASK> . the one concession the nfl has made in regards to its uniform policy involved the commemoration of the 11 september 2001 terrorist attacks . although the league reportedly warned at least one player that altering their uniform for the attack \u2019 s anniversary would result in fines , the league never actually issued them :",

        "text": "in the spring of 1823 , two men by the names of de voe and lozier ( a retired butcher and a wealthy contractor , respectively ) whiled away an idle day with an excursion to their familiar stomping grounds at new york city \u2019 s centre market . there , at a table in the back of the market , they regaled an enthralled audience of butchers , farmers , and fishmongers with an astounding tale : manhattan island was sinking . <PARA> by the 1820s , burgeoning new york city had become america \u2019 s most populous city with 150 , 000 inhabitants , and the combined weight of all the additional people and the buildings and other infrastructure necessary to support them , the two men <MASK> , had made manhattan too bottom - heavy , and the island was beginning to sink into the harbor . <PARA> not to worry , de voe and lozier averred to the credulous crowd \u2014 they had been hired by new york mayor stephen allen to deal with the problem and had come up with a masterful plan to stave off impending disaster : they were to oversee a massive , coordinated effort to saw manhattan in half , then tow the lower half out in the harbor , turn it around , and reattach it . the most heavily populated section of manhattan would then be situated in the middle of a more balanced island , and the danger of its tipping and spilling into new york harbor would be ameliorated . <PARA> maybe it sounded a bit incredible , but to an audience of uneducated new yorkers who had witnessed the ongoing successful development of the erie canal , no engineering feat seemed beyond the abilities of dedicated , hard - working men . <PARA> such a mammoth undertaking would require a huge investment in labor and material , both of which the vendors and laborers found in the centre market were only too happy to volunteer to provide . with new york ravaged by an economic depression and a yellow fever epidemic , work was hard to find . the prospect of steady employment at good wages , even of a temporary nature , was a godsend . <PARA> over the ensuing weeks , de voe and lozier signed up the hundreds of eager workmen , craftsmen , and suppliers required for their project : the manual laborers needed to do the work of sawing the island in half ( twenty men per saw , provided they could demonstrate a suitable ability to hold their breath while sawing underwater ), rowing it out past governor \u2019 s and ellis islands into the harbor ( one hundred men per oar ), pivoting it , bringing it back in , and re - attaching it ; the carpenters and joiners needed to fashion twenty 100 - foot - long saws with three - foot teeth and two dozen 250 <MORE> from this one work that all information about the great \u201c manhattan sawed in half \u201d hoax springs . <PARA> single - source tales are often problematic , and indeed problems abound with this particular source . john de voe couldn \u2019 t recall important details , such as the year the prank occurred ( it was either 1823 or 1824 ; he didn \u2019 t remember which ) or the first name used by his partner lozier . and although he admitted that \u201c lozier \u201d was a pseudonym , he couldn \u2019 t recall his partner \u2019 s real name , even though the two men were supposedly friends . <PARA> more suspect , though , nobody other than john de voe seems to have left any record whatsoever of his participation in this gargantuan put - on , or of the put - on itself . no newspaper of the day made any mention of this mammoth undertaking , or its failure to come off . no published journals , diaries , or letters by new yorkers of the era include any reference to a plan that supposedly enlisted hundreds of local workers and supporters . no writer found this <MASK> sufficiently interesting to chronicle while anyone involved with ( or fooled by ) it was still alive . no arrests , prosecutions , or civil lawsuits followed in the wake of this cruel exploitation of public gullibility . <PARA> plenty of excuses are offered for this suspicious lack of documentation \u2014 that de voe and lozier had committed no crime , that no one involved wanted to embarrass himself by admitting he \u2019 d been taken in , that most of those duped were immigrants circumspect about speaking to outsiders \u2014 but the improbability of a such an absurd prank \u2019 s very visibly ensnaring several hundred victims in the country \u2019 s largest city yet remaining completely unremarked upon cannot be dismissed . the hoax here isn \u2019 t that two men once led hundreds of foolish new yorkers into falling for an incredibly silly scheme \u2014 the real hoax is that so many people since then have believed they did . <PARA> it \u2019 s possible that de voe did have a partner , and that they did once briefly lead a few na\u00efve centre market denizens into falling for a tall tale about sawing manhattan in half to keep it from sinking , but no credible <MASK> exists to verify that they pulled off anything on the scale attributed to them by latter - day chroniclers . in the end , though , as writer joel rose concluded an account of his efforts to trace the <MASK> of the hoax : <PARA> or , as margo jefferson put it more succinctly : \u201c the public enjoyed both tales ... people wanted to believe and know they \u2019 d be conned , as long as they didn \u2019 t know when or how .\u201d",
