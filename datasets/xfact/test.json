        "text": "this is a developing <MASK> . <PARA> in the early morning hours of 2 december 2017 , the senate passed a sweeping tax bill that had been edited in private by republican legislators and included hand - written notes in the margins . the secretive and controversial nature of the bill generated a significant amount of questions and confusion , as did the house \u2019 s draft version of the bill \u2014 which still must be reconciled with the senate version before it becomes law . the senate published the almost 500 - page text of the bill , officially titled the tax cuts and jobs act , on 5 december . <PARA> its controversial nature was illustrated by the dueling hashtags # taxreform and # taxscambill , and , as is often the case in scenarios involving a deep partisan divide , the late - night passage of the bill and social media debate about it led to a number of <MASK> , facebook forwards , and other <MASK> of sometimes questionable veracity . here are some of those questions , answered : <PARA> does the tax plan eliminate deductions for losses from wildfires , other natural disasters ? <PARA> the house version of the bill would entirely eliminate personal casualty loss deductions for uninsured losses from natural disasters , while the senate version would allow them , but only in cases of \u201c federally declared disasters .\u201d the change would not take effect until 2018 , however , which means victims of the 2017 california wildfires would still be able to deduct qualified losses . <PARA> would the tax plan count graduate tuition waivers as taxable income ? <PARA> the version of the tax cuts and jobs act introduced in the house did strike down existing law that exempts tuition waivers from taxable income . however , the final version of the bill passed by the senate removes this provision entirely , leaving graduate school tuition waivers untaxed . <PARA> does the tax plan cut cancer treatments for medicare patients ? <PARA> while the bill does not mention medicare specifically , critics said that the consequences of its passing would trigger cuts that would curtail patients \u2019 access to health care and eliminate medical deductions they would normally count on while seeking treatment , hitting cancer patients especially hard . but republican leadership insists that they would safeguard the program if the bill passes . <PARA> would the tax plan make employee discounts taxable income ? <PARA> the tax cuts and jobs act would remove the exemption for some employee fringe benefits , like reimbursements that employees get from their companies when they move for a job . however , employee discounts , where employees get discounts on products or services sold by their employer , remain untaxed income both in the draft versions and the bill the senate passed on 2 december . <PARA> would the tax bill grant \u201c personhood \u201d to fetuses ? <PARA> both <MORE> <PARA> does the tax plan double the standard deduction for individuals and married couples ? <PARA> the bill increases the standard deduction from $ 6 , 350 to $ 12 , 000 for individuals and from $ 12 , 700 to $ 24 , 000 for married couples \u2014 a key component of the legislation , and one often touted by president trump and republican leaders in congress . <PARA> however , while some people stand to benefit , it won \u2019 t be a windfall for everyone because other deductions would be done away with \u2014 the personal exemptions for individual taxpayers and qualifying dependents ($ 4 , 050 per person ), for example . the los angeles times published an analysis of the tax bill \u2019 s give - and - take surrounding the standard deduction . <PARA> is there a provision in the tax bill allowing oil drilling in alaska \u2019 s arctic wildlife preserve ? <PARA> a proposal on page 461 of the 466 - page senate version of the tax cuts and jobs act would , in fact , \u201c establish and administer a competitive oil and gas program \u201d at the northernmost tip of the arctic national wildlife refuge on alaska \u2019 s north slope . environmental groups strongly objected to the provision , which has no evident connection to tax reform . <PARA> would the tax bill increase taxes on 87 million families ? <PARA> the sources citing this figure \u2014 including the atlantic and the center for american progress \u2014 calculated it using a spreadsheet prepared by the tax policy center , a nonpartisan think tank associated with the brookings institution . the tax policy center based the spreadsheet on their analysis of major provisions in the senate bill . <PARA> however , the <MASK> doesn \u2019 t represent the whole <MASK> . <MASK> more exactly , 87 million households with incomes under $ 200 , 000 a year will see their tax burdens increase by 2027 . adding in taxpayers at the highest income levels , that number swells to just short of 94 million ( 50 . 3 percent of taxpayers ) who will experience a tax increase by 2027 . however , that \u2019 s principally because the bill stipulates that the tax cuts on individuals will expire after 2025 . <PARA> will the tax plan add $ 1 trillion to the federal deficit ? <PARA> according to projections by congress \u2019 s own joint committee on taxation , the tax cut and jobs act ( specifically , the senate version ) would indeed add more than $ 1 trillion in deficits over the next 10 years \u2014 even after economic growth is taken into account . this would mean , among other things , that substantial spending cuts would be required to keep the deficit under control . the estimate may change after the house and senate bills have been reconciled into a single piece of legislation .",

        "text": "in the summer of 2018 , president donald trump \u2019 s \u201c zero tolerance \u201d immigration policy was met with widespread criticism , prompting the trump administration to scale back elements of the plan ( which saw thousands of children separated from their parents at the southwestern border ) after less than three months . <PARA> however , the opposition to that policy prompted allegations of hypocrisy leveled by supporters of president trump against his predecessor , barack obama . some of those comparisons were inaccurate and misleading , as we have examined here previously . <PARA> commentators and social media users brought up an old <MASK> made by barack obama back when he was a u . s . senator representing illinois , in which he expressed opposition to \u201c undetected , undocumented , unchecked \u201d immigration . the highlighting of that <MASK> was intended to create an equivalence between the views expressed by barack obama in 2005 and the \u201c zero tolerance \u201d policy enacted by his successor in the white house in 2018 , and ( either explicitly or implicitly ) level the charge of partisan opportunism and hypocrisy against liberal opponents of trump \u2019 s policies . <PARA> on 23 june , fox news contributor gary kaltbaum appeared on cavuto live and read out the <MASK> in question : <PARA> on 18 june 2018 , the <MASK> was posted on the popular pro - trump reddit forum / the_donald , and on 23 july , val digiorgio ( chairman of the chester county , pennsylvania republican party ) posted a meme showing a photograph of obama along with the same <MASK> that kaltbaum read out on fox news : <PARA> obama did indeed speak these words in 2005 , and also said something very similar in 2006 , although his expressed opposition to unchecked illegal immigration in 2005 was not the same as support for the \u201c zero tolerance \u201d immigration policy implemented by the trump administration in 2018 . <PARA> on 15 december 2005 , barack obama joined republican senator mel martinez of florida in a press conference about bipartisan efforts to bring about immigration reform , during which the former <MASK> : <PARA> obama then laid out the three basic principles of his preferred approach to immigration reform : enhanced border security and enforcement , a guest worker program and electronic verification capabilities for employers , and an \u201c interim legal <MASK> \u201d for the millions of undocumented immigrants living in the united <MASK> whereby those who entered the country illegally would pay a \u201c hefty fine \u201d and \u201c go to the back of the line \u201d before applying for u . s . citizenship . <PARA> the future president repeatedly criticized any approach to immigration reform that focused only on enforcement measures . immediately after uttering the words that would be recirculated in 2018 , senator obama continued on to say : <PARA> on 3 april 2006 , senator obama spoke from <MORE> - pronged approach : better border security and enforcement , a guest worker program with enhanced protections for the rights of immigrant workers and a system for employers to check the legal <MASK> of would - be employees , and a conditional path to citizenship for immigrants who had entered the country illegally . <PARA> ( a full transcript of obama \u2019 s 2006 remarks is available here , on page 24 .) <PARA> \u2018 he sounds like donald trump \u2019 <PARA> in 2005 , obama did say : \u201c we simply cannot allow people to pour into the united <MASK> , undetected , undocumented , unchecked and circumventing the line of people who are waiting patiently , diligently and lawfully to become immigrants in this country .\u201d and he said something very similar a few months later , in 2006 . <PARA> however , in doing so he was merely articulating an orthodox , relatively uncontroversial position among most american politicians : that the u . s . ought not to have open , unmonitored borders , and immigrants who applied for a visa to live and work in the u . s . should be treated preferentially to those who simply crossed the border without legal <MASK> . <PARA> at no time during the 2005 or 2006 speeches in question did obama advocate the equivalent of a \u201c zero tolerance \u201d policy of processing even first - time \u201c improper \u201d border crossings via criminal trials , a prosecutorial shift which has necessitated the mass separation of children from parents at the southwestern border ( a system we have written about in greater detail elsewhere ). <PARA> during his tenure as president , barack obama did oversee the criminal prosecution of some illegal border crossers ( as opposed to the traditional approach of administrative removal ), under a program known as operation streamline begun in 2005 during the administration of president george w . bush . however , this approach was still largely limited to repeat offenders or those with criminal records , and first - time \u201c improper \u201d entrants into the united <MASK> typically continued to be processed administratively before being deported . <PARA> crucially , the \u201c zero tolerance \u201d policy announced by attorney general jeff sessions in april 2018 prescribed the criminal prosecution of all individuals crossing the border unlawfully , even for the first time \u2014 a distinctive characteristic of the trump policy , and the one that brought about the separation of thousands of families at the border , during the spring and summer of 2018 . <PARA> president obama also oversaw an increase in the rate of deportations during his tenure as president , something that brought about the separation of some immigrant families already residing in the united <MASK> . but those families were not typically separated at the border , and this increase in deportations was partly attributable to a change in definitions used in compiling immigration <MASK> .",

        "text": "<MASK> : this mish - mash of <MASK> began circulating on the internet in the summer of 1998 . it is usually attributed to \u201c donna c . boisseau \u201d, who may or may not be a real person but whom this missive makes out to be the \u201c woman getting her ph . d . at university of colorado @ boulder \u201d who supposedly researched the information and is now sounding the alarm over her <PARA> findings . <PARA> two other names have been dragged into the fray by those looking to attribute <MASK> made in the e - mail to an authoritative figure : stephanie baker and dr . benita s . katzenellenbogen of the molecular and integrative physiology department of the university of illinois at urbana - champaign . neither of them vets the information presented in the boisseau e - mail , and how their names came to be associated with it is explained on dr . katzenellenbogen \u2019 s denial of involvement . in a nutshell , baker ( katzenellenbogen \u2019 s assistant ) foolishly forwarded the e - mail to others , unaware that her signature block linking her to a respected figure in the field of cell and structural biology remained in place , and that this action made it look like the doctor she worked for had verified and supported what this boisseau warning had to say . the doctor , of course , had no knowledge of any of this until her assistant began to be deluged with phone calls and e - mails about the matter . <PARA> ( information about dr . katzenellenbogen and her area of expertise can be found on her web page .) <PARA> moving beyond the question this e - mailed scare \u2019 s <MASK> , we shift to a discussion of the <MASK> made in the missive . i \u2019 m sorry , but there is no such thing as a safe tampon \u2014 all the demanding in the world isn \u2019 t going to change that , so the clarion cry of \u201c tell everyone to write to the companies ,\u201d while stirring , is also naive . all - cotton unbleached tampons still leave the user at risk of toxic shock syndrome , a fact calls to arms like this one gloss over . <PARA> there is some truth in the scare , but a lot a misinformation is mixed in around it . let \u2019 s separate the wheat from the chaff . <PARA> this e - mailed warning contains a number of <MASK> about the dangers presented by american - made tampons . the worst of them is the one we can dismiss outright : there \u2019 s no truth to the notion of tampon manufacturers putting asbestos in their products to promote bleeding . according to a 23 july 1999 <MASK> by the fda : <PARA> fda has no <MASK> of asbestos in tampons or any reports regarding increased <MORE> a tampon in overnight ; use a pad . <PARA> as for dioxins , a 1994 environmental protection agency ( epa ) study concluded that exposure to dioxins , even at low levels , can result in a number of non - cancer health effects in humans , including developmental and reproductive effects , immune suppression , and disruption of regulatory hormones . other researchers suspect a link between dioxin exposure and endometriosis . <PARA> the fda says there aren \u2019 t enough dioxins in tampons to worry about : <PARA> in 1995 , fda again requested the four major manufacturers to submit dioxin levels in the rayon and cotton used to manufacture tampons . the manufacturers used an analytical method approved by epa . the data from all four manufacturers showed dioxin levels in rayon and cotton to range from non - detectable to 1 part in 3 trillion . a part per trillion is about the same as one teaspoon in a lake fifteen feet deep and a mile square . this is far below the threshold that epa believes puts consumers at risk of cancer . <PARA> ( you don \u2019 t trust the fda , you say ? do you put more trust in a possibly fictitious \u201c woman getting her ph . d . at university of colorado @ boulder \u201d?). <PARA> there isn \u2019 t an easy answer on how to avoid contact with trace amounts of dioxins . dioxin are a byproduct of the bleaching process most paper products are subject to , but it also gets into the environment through the burning of chemicals . ( the theory has been advanced that any wood fire produces dioxins , but that might be taking it a bit far .) some tampons and sanitary pads contain minute amounts of this chemical , but so do milk cartons . dioxins also turn up in fish , meat , and dairy products . <PARA> those concerned about exposure to dioxins through their feminine products should make the move to unbleached ones . they should keep in mind though that dioxins are all around them , and changing their brand of tampon or napkin won \u2019 t eliminate all exposures to dioxins . perhaps that \u2019 s the greatest disservice e - mails like this do \u2014 they leave readers with the impression that a problem is easily solved by making an angry phone call to an errant manufacturer . <PARA> would that it were that simple . <PARA> to round this up for those in the bleachers , there is no asbestos in tampons . depending on the brand , there might be minute amounts of dioxins in some of them , but not ( according to the fda ) enough to harm anyone . thinking consumers might want to reduce their contact with dioxins anyway , trading comfort and absorbency for a bit more peace of mind . <PARA> barbara \u201c monthly dilemma \u201d mikkelson",
