the industry \u2019 s contributions to kennedy total $ 348 , 077 over the course of his six - year career as a politician . <PARA> investments in pharmaceuticals <PARA> the grit post <MASK> and the meme also allege kennedy had personal investments in a controversial pharmaceutical company . grit post writes : <PARA> while it \u2019 s <MASK> kennedy has investments in gilead , this <MASK> is slightly misleading and out of date . <PARA> in may 2016 , the boston globe reported that the congressman had \u201c earned stock value of up to $ 434 , 999 from investments in gilead sciences inc \u201d and furthermore : <PARA> so actually , kennedy \u2019 s investments in gilead could have been as low as $ 180 , 004 at the time of the boston globe <MASK> in may 2016 . the globe was careful to point out that members of congress are not required to provide exact figures for their personal investments and assets , but rather ranges . grit post left out this detail . <PARA> in any event , kennedy provided a more up - to - date financial disclosure at the end of 2016 , which showed his investments in gilead by then totalled between $ 80 , 003 and $ 200 , 000 . <PARA> financial disclosures for 2017 have not yet been published . <PARA> whatever the exact amounts involved , kennedy \u2019 s investment in gilead has been controversial largely because the company sells solvadi , its brand name for the drug sofosbuvir , which is used to treat hepatitis c . as grit post points out , gilead sciences has attracted criticism for the high price of solvadi which is $ 1 , 000 per pill or $ 84 , 000 for a course of treatment . <PARA> kennedy \u2019 s investment is part of a trust fund managed by a financial adviser . craig holman , from the advocacy group public citizen , told the globe in 2016 that the profits kennedy and the company were making were \u201c harming many of the citizens of massachusetts .\u201d <PARA> according to open secrets , 19 members of congress ( as well as donald trump ) held shares in gilead sciences in 2015 . <PARA> stance on marijuana <PARA> the grit post meme \u2019 s <MASK> that kennedy opposes marijuana legalization is accurate . while the national conversation has shifted to discuss recreational marijuana \u2019 s legalization , over the years many leaders have come to voice support for the medical uses for marijuana . <PARA> however , kennedy not only opposes recreational use , but he has a record of voting against measures to protect and enhance access to medical marijuana . in 2015 , kennedy was one of 10 democrats who sided with a republican majority to pass a bill that would \u2014 among many other things \u2014 restrict funding for <MASK> that wanted to legalize marijuana . the bill died in senate . <PARA> grit post also correctly pointed out that kennedy , in a 2016 interview , said \u201c i don \u2019 t think marijuana should be legalized .\u201d <PARA> stance on universal healthcare <PARA> the meme \u2019 s <MASK> that kennedy opposes \u201c universal healthcare legislation \u201d requires closer examination . <PARA> in september 2017 , kennedy expressed tentative support for a single - payer healthcare system , but hesitated to support bills then before the house of representatives and senate that would have expanded medicare . <PARA> at the time , kennedy told boston public radio the bills were \u201c 100 percent right on the value that they \u2019 re trying to enshrine into federal law \u2014 that healthcare is a right in this country , not a privilege to be enjoyed by the few ...\u201d <PARA> however , he said there were \u201c details \u201d in the house bill ( introduced by democratic rep . john conyers ) with which he was \u2018 struggling .\u2019 <PARA> when pressed , kennedy said he supported universal healthcare , but said a single - payer system ( funded by taxes and administered by the government ) was \u201c a way that we could get there , and that \u2019 s great , but i think that the critical piece to this is ensuring that everybody gets access to quality , affordable , accessible healthcare ...\u201d <PARA> so kennedy has given theoretical support to universal healthcare , but has been fuzzy on the details of how it should be achieved , and he did not support specific legislation that , if passed , would have massively expanded health coverage in the united <MASK> .",

        "text": "on 6 february 2017 , the pro - life website life news published an <MASK> headlined \u201c oregon bill would allow starving mentally ill patients to death .\u201d that <MASK> , consisting primarily of a press release from the oregon right to life group , reported on oregon senate bill 494 , which proposed changes to that <MASK> \u2019 s advance directive legislation . ( advanced directives are legal documents used to appoint an official representative to make health decisions in the event someone becomes incapacitated .) <PARA> the life news <MASK> is out of date , as a different version of the same legislation , house bill 4135 , was signed into law on 16 march 2018 . the primary purpose behind both pieces of legislation was the simplification and clarification of the form used to create advance directives . the advance directive debate in 2018 was indeed controversial , and the passage of house bill 4135 took place along party lines , but those debates were largely about how much power to give the committee charged with creating the new form and not about the cessation of life support . <PARA> most opponents of hb 4135 , such as republican <MASK> sen . dennis linthicum , agreed in general with the direction of the bill but expressed concern that the legislation \u2019 s wording gave \u201c the committee too much power and provides the legislature too little oversight .\u201d <PARA> according to the <MASK> - general , \u201c lawmakers on both sides agreed the current form [ was ] in dire need of improvement ,\u201d primarily owing to its overly complicated or vague wording . in a broad sense the bill made two substantive changes to existing advance directive laws , which were first passed in 1993 and had not been modified until 2018 , as described by the corvallis gazette - times : <PARA> in oregon , this area of legislation frequently intersects with concerns raised by pro - life groups that typically focus on the rights of the unborn . that \u2019 s because advance directives can include directions and preferences on receiving ( or declining ) life - sustaining treatments under certain circumstances . in their <MASK> , life news attempted to draw a connection between this proposed legislation and oregon \u2019 s 1997 death with dignity act , implying the new law represented a step toward forced euthanasia via the cessation of life support or artificial feeding of persons medically incapable of making medical decisions for themselves : <PARA> this is a bad - faith argument . while certain circumstances exist in which it would be legal in oregon to cease providing tube - feeding or other life support to mentally incapacitated individuals who left no advance directive and whose next of kin or legal representatives could not be located , such a scenario existed in oregon <MASK> law before house bill 4135 . and the plausibility of that scenario remained largely unchanged following <MORE> 635 <MASK> that \u201c life - sustaining procedures that would otherwise be applied to a principal who is incapable and who does not have an appointed health care representative or applicable valid advance directive may be withheld or withdrawn ... if the principal has been medically confirmed to be in one of the following conditions : <PARA> the notion that the bill would \u201c allow for the starving of patients with dementia or mental illness \u201d comes from the subsequent portions of ors 127 . 635 , which touch on scenarios under which an \u201c incapable \u201d adult meets the above conditions and has no appointed healthcare representative , next of kin , or advance directive under oregon law : <PARA> this section <MASK> that if a mentally incapable person meets the criteria described in all the excerpts above , but that person does not have an advance directive or appointed health care representative , the de facto representative shall be drawn from a specific list of people ranging from an authorized guardian to \u201c any adult relative or adult friend .\u201d if none of these people can be identified , the law <MASK> \u201c then life - sustaining procedures may be withheld or withdrawn upon the direction and under the supervision of the attending physician .\u201d <PARA> as mentioned before , though , the entirety of the oregon law cited above , which could allow for the termination of life support for incapable individuals who met extremely narrow criteria , existed prior to senate bill 494 or house bill 4135 . the legislation signed into law in 2018 did make minor changes to section 127 . 635 of the oregon revised <MASK> , but the substance of these laws remains unchanged . before the passage of house bill 4135 , as well as after , the only situation in which the headline <MASK> that it is legal to \u201c starve mentally ill patients to death \u201d would be <MASK> would be a situation in which : <PARA> a person who suffers from mental illness or dementia may be classified as \u201c incapable ,\u201d but that is not sufficient grounds for terminating life support . this was <MASK> before house bill 4135 , and it remains <MASK> now after that bill was signed into law : that law made no changes to ors 127 . 580 . the most notable change made to 127 . 635 was the addition of a clause after the sentence \u201c life - sustaining procedures may be withheld or withdrawn upon the direction and under the supervision of the attending physician or attending health care provider \u201d ( emphasis ours ). <PARA> because both senate bill 494 or house bill 4135 did not substantively alter the legal requirements for terminating life support in incapable adults , however , we rank as <MASK> the <MASK> that these bills \u2019 purpose was \u201c designed to allow for the starving of patients with dementia or mental illness .\u201d",

        "text": "as political rhetoric about the dangers of immigration grew to a \u201c full trumpism \u201d fever pitch in the run - up to the 2018 u . s . midterm elections , several online meme - makers and anti - immigration pundits ratcheted up speculation about the potential health risks posed by immigration across the southern u . s . border . <PARA> such <MASK> were usually heavily speculative \u201c what if \u201d <MASK> , tended to be light on factual analysis or good - faith arguments , and were usually attached to misleading or unrelated photos in an effort to generate fear . <PARA> \u201c what about diseases ?\u201d brian kilmeade opined in a 29 october 2018 \u201c fox & friends \u201d segment about a central american caravan , \u201c i mean , there \u2019 s a reason you can \u2019 t bring a kid to school unless he \u2019 s inoculated .\u201d kilmeade did not provide any factual <MASK> to suggest an increased risk of disease from caravan members , nor did he indicate what kind of diseases were of concern . <PARA> nearly all arguments or memes asserting a risk of disease from southern border crossing used photographs and news stories from a specific outbreak that occurred in that area during in the summer of 2014 . a representative post of this ilk displayed a photograph and posited that \u201c the bumps on this illegal \u2019 s body who was detained from the caravan @ the border is smallpox \u201d: <PARA> the accompanying image showed a man with a case of scabies ( a dermatologic condition caused by mites ), not smallpox , however . <PARA> the photograph used in this 2 november 2018 meme was taken by u . s . rep . henry cuellar at a customs and border protection facility in south texas and was first published by the houston chronicle on 11 june 2014 . that year saw the beginning of a large influx of central americans attempting to cross into the united <MASK> , an event attributed largely to increasing political unrest and poverty in el salvador , guatemala , and honduras , and one which overwhelmed the existing u . s . immigration and border patrol capacities at the time . <PARA> the 2014 scabies outbreak was heavily reported on by right - wing outlets such as breitbart and the washington times . these outlets and many others uncritically repeated speculative fears presented in local news segments , and they continued to be cited to justify fears of disease from immigrants in 2018 . it is therefore informative to look at the fears raised in these 2014 stories to see if they were justified . <PARA> a 10 june 2014 <MASK> in the washington times raised concerns that diseases \u201c of an even more serious nature \u201d than scabies could infect the united <MASK> ( emphasis on speculative language ours ): <PARA> breitbart \u2019 s coverage from 27 may 2014 raised <MORE> cited concerns that immigrants from central american countries were bringing zika ( one of the diseases attributed to immigrants in the 2018 immigration memes ) to the united <MASK> in 2015 . while pundits attempted to blame illegal immigration for zika cases in the united <MASK> , the numbers do not support such a conclusion : <PARA> in 2016 , 185 million legal northbound crossings took place at ports of entry along the 2 , 000 - mile border between the united <MASK> and mexico . by comparison , the number of migrants in the latest caravan ( 2018 ) is in the thousands . <PARA> another relevant point is that many of the maladies listed in anti - immigration memes concern diseases that are all but eradicated in the united <MASK> thanks to vaccination efforts . polio , for example , has been considered eradicated from the entire american continent since 1994 . <PARA> in fact , many of the countries in central america from which the migrants are attempting to flee have higher vaccination rates for diseases such as measles than the united <MASK> does . in 2017 , 92 % of children aged 12 - 23 months were vaccinated for measles in the united <MASK> . in mexico and honduras that figure was higher , at 96 % and 97 % respectively . el salvador and guatemala have seen a recent decline in vaccination rates , with 85 % and 86 % coverage in 2017 . regardless , the notion that these commonly vaccinated conditions are in wide circulation outside of the united <MASK> and therefore present in higher levels in border - crossing immigrants is dubious . <PARA> a measles outbreak in an arizona immigration detention facility occurred in 2016 , infecting both staff and detainees , but it did not spread to the general public . its peril to the u . s . staff stemmed primarily from a lack of vaccination on the part of the staff working there . rush limbaugh attempted to blame a different measles outbreak at disneyland in 2015 on illegal immigration , but that outbreak was exacerbated not by illegal immigration but by lower than average vaccination rates in southern california . <PARA> while the cdc does suggest some risk of communicable disease transmission across the southern border , they do not attribute it to illegal immigration , but rather to the high level of transportation across the border in general : <PARA> in short , while detained populations of people held in close quarters carry a higher risk for the transmission of communicable diseases such as scabies or tuberculosis within that population , no <MASK> suggests that those populations pose a health risk to the surrounding communities . efforts on the internet to make that risk appear acute do so by misrepresenting out - of - date figures and by ignoring the epidemiological realities of a world that sees one billion people cross international borders every year .",

        "text": "for those looking for a quick answer to the question of whether the above narrative is literally <MASK> , we \u2019 ll <MASK> up front that it is not . nothing remotely like the account related above appears in any biography or <MASK> about albert einstein , nor is the account congruent with that scientist \u2019 s expressed views on the subject of religion ( in which he generally described himself as an \u201c agnostic \u201d or a \u201c religious nonbeliever \u201d). einstein \u2019 s name has simply been inserted into an anecdote created long after his death in order to provide the reading audience with a recognizable figure and thus lend the tale an air of verisimilitude <PARA> as to what this account says from a standpoint of faith , one of the most troubling conundrums is the question of how evil and suffering can survive in a universe created and managed by a loving supreme being . postulated explanations of this paradox are known as theodicies , and such answers have been for centuries handed out by members of many belief systems when challenged to provide logical answers to the question of how it is possible that a just and moral god can co - exist with evil . among these answers are : <PARA> the online forward <MASK> above draws upon yet another possible explanation : that evil is the absence of god , in the same way that cold is the absence of heat , and dark is the absence of light . this argument has been around for a long time , as has the legend about the pious student <PARA> using it to squelch an atheist professor . <PARA> the name of einstein gets used in legends whose plots call for a smart person , one whom the audience will immediately recognize as such ( i . e ., modern tellings of an ancient legend about a learned rabbi who switches places with his servant feature albert einstein in the role of esteemed scholar ). this venerated cultural icon has , at least in the world of contemporary lore , become a stock character to be tossed into the fray wherever the script calls for a genius . <PARA> likewise , \u201c the atheist professor \u201d is a stock figure common to a number of urban legends and anecdotes of the faithful : he gets flung into the mix where there \u2019 s a need for someone to play the role of science vanquished in science - versus - religion tales . but he is not inserted merely to serve as an icon of learning to be humbled in tales that aim to teach that faith is of greater value than provable knowledge ; he is also woven into these sorts of stories for his lack of belief . just as the villain in <PARA> oldtime melodramas had to have a waxed moustache , a black cape , and an evil laugh , so <MORE> one putting the boots to the other . <PARA> \u201c the atheist professor \u201d plays his expected role of getting his pants kicked in the dropped chalk tale , where he ( once again ) challenges his browbeaten students on the topic of god \u2019 s existence . he is also pivotal to these following tales , which are yet other variations on the same theme : <PARA> the key to understanding the allure of these tales lies in this one line from the \u201c evil is the absence of god \u201d <MASK> : \u201c the professor was quite pleased with himself and boasted to the students that he had proven once more that the christian faith was a myth .\u201d <PARA> faith can \u2019 t be proved ( or disproved ); if such validations were possible , those concepts would stop being matters of faith and start being matters of fact . unfortunately , this leaves those who are convinced of the existence of god without an incontrovertible , irrefutable answer to those who challenge them to provide <MASK> of the veracity of their belief systems \u2019 tenets , or to demonstrate beyond any shadow of doubt that their inner direction is the right one to those who insist on independently verifiable <MASK> of that which can \u2019 t be proved . <PARA> that god permits evil to exist ( and some would say to thrive ) is taken by non - believers as an inarguable sign that there is no supreme being . this puzzle is pointed to by them as the unanswerable fallacy that proves the negative : they reckon that a loving , all - powerful god would have stamped out evil , ergo he doesn \u2019 t exist , or he is not all - powerful , or he is not all that enamored of his children . as such , this paradox can be disquieting to those who do believe : not only do they themselves have to wrestle with the seeming disconnect , they are left unable to convincingly answer their critics when this topic comes up . they find themselves similarly hamstrung when pressed to prove the existence of god . <PARA> stories about atheist professors being bested by <MASK> believers who did have answers at the ready are both ventings of this frustration and expressions of delight in finally seeming to have been armed with deft responses to fling back . these are tales of affirmation , modern - day parables of trials overcome and fierce adversaries bested by those who held fast to what they believed in , even in the face of ridicule rained down by authority figures . like parables , they are meant to inspire similar resolve in those with whom they are shared : should those members of the flock ever find themselves in like circumstances , they should feel moved to emulate the brave students of legend who stood up to the atheist professors .",

( or , if you must , skip the next three paragraphs to transition directly to the u . s . portion of the <MASK> .) <PARA> the euro is the official currency of the european union , a supranational union comprising 27 member <MASK> , and is the sole currency for more than 317 million people . ( not every eu member country has chosen to adopt the euro ; some continue to use their traditional currencies .) <PARA> the move to a single currency in europe comes with both advantages and disadvantages . on the plus side , it does away with the cost of exchanging money , thereby leaving more cash in the pockets of both individual consumers and businesses . it also puts an end to the trouble of having to change one \u2019 s currency into that of the country being traveled to or traded with , then having to change it back again afterwards \u2014 one simply uses the same wad of bills . and it ends fluctuations in the value of one country \u2019 s money in relation to that of another : when only one currency is used , a cross - border deal struck for a specified amount of cash does not suddenly go up or down in price as the financial markets move , thereby ruining one party to the deal while dropping a windfall into the undeserving lap of the other . <PARA> on <MORE> have a few proponents , it is a long way from being taken seriously , let alone being regarded as a good idea . <PARA> which brings us to the question of the \u201c amero ,\u201d the name bestowed upon the hypothetical currency such a union would use as its common specie . in 1999 , a professor of economics at simon fraser university in vancouver published the case for the amero , a study that advanced the idea that the <PARA> three north american countries would be better served by their having a common currency . and there the matter rests , or at least it did before designs computed thought to add to its catalogue of commemorative coins , medals , and tokens a suite of ameros , a series of collectible coins struck from its concept of what coinage for such a currency might look like . designs computed is very clear on its web site that its ameros are in fact \u201c private - issue fantasy pattern coins [ that ] will be struck as an annual series ,\u201d and indeed is already offering some of them for sale . neither the u . s . mint nor the u . s . treasury had a hand in creating these \u201c ameros .\u201d these coins are merely collectibles offered to the buying public by a private company in the business of manufacturing such curiosities . <PARA> on 31 august 2007 , radio host hal turner used images of the amero tokens offered by designs computed as the basis for propagating a patently <MASK> tale about his having been given a \u201c real \u201d amero coin on the sly by an anonymous treasury agent , and that the existence of said coin was \u201c <MASK> \u201d that the usa , canada , and mexico were \u201c to be merged into a single new entity \u201d known as the north american union . <PARA> after we ( and others ) debunked turner \u2019 s fictional , outrage - provoking conspiracy theory by pointing out the <MASK> <MASK> of the amero tokens , he began <MASK> that the designs computed site had been hastily erected on the internet as part of \u201c a full blown effort to discredit my <MASK> and the images as fake .\u201d that was not the case : daniel carr , the entrepreneur behind designs computed , has been displaying the coins he has designed on his web site since at least 2000 and has been offering some of them for sale since at least 2005 . while his \u201c amero \u201d entry dates only to 2007 , the coins depicted thereon fit seamlessly into his catalogue of similar offerings , including his \u201c parody <MASK> quarters .\u201d <PARA> ( do have a look at some of his \u201c parody <MASK> quarters ,\u201d particularly maine \u2018 s and colorado \u2018 s , which especially tickled our fancy .) <PARA> barbara \u201c maine event \u201d mikkelson",
