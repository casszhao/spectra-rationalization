deleted crisis actor post included the following : <PARA> in response to our request for <MASK> documenting this <MASK> , the crisis actor directed us to a pa images photograph taken on the day of the attack , which seemingly shows a pc ( i . e ., police constable ) clad in jeans . however , there are several non - suspect explanations for why a police officer might be wearing jeans at a given moment , and in this case the photograph shows four police officers at work near the site of the bomb attack who apparently were simply wearing plain clothes at that moment . in any case , it stretches credulity to propose that an extremely complicated \u201c <MASK> flag \u201d operation orchestrated by sophisticated forces such as the metropolitan police and u . k . intelligence services were caught out because a participant slipped up and forgot to wear the right trousers . <PARA> this <MASK> is demonstrably <MASK> . we found one photograph of a vehicle that may have borne this license plate ( i . e ., registration ) number : a police van seen on the right - hand side of a pa images photograph taken near parsons green on the day of the attack appears to bear the license plate lx13 aos . however , this van ( a vauxhall vivaro ) has been part of the british transport police fleet since at least as far back as may <MORE> \u201c seems to be a bogus lead \u201d and accepted that it \u201c appears \u201d to be an authentic police vehicle rather than a rented prop . <PARA> it \u2019 s not clear from the photograph how badly the woman in question was hurt , nor exactly what part of her head might have been injured . if she was photographed using a cellphone , it \u2019 s not possible to draw any conclusions about what that means : she might have placed the phone next to an uninjured ear , or her ear may not have sustained damage so severe that using it with a cellphone was necessarily difficult or painful ( especially in the context of an emergency during which contacting loved ones would likely have been a priority ). <PARA> the crisis actor directed us to a photograph that appeared on the metro news web site , but that image was too blurry to definitively identify whether the woman captured on a cell phone in the background of that photograph was the same woman pictured the photograph used in the crisis actor \u2019 s facebook post . <PARA> this aspect of the parsons green attack is one most commonly cited as <MASK> the incident was a staged hoax . the failure of the bomb to cause extensive damage to the interior of the train carriage , the survival of the plastic bag and bucket that contained the bomb , the absence of plumes of smoke in the aftermath of the bomb , and the widespread lack of visible scorching on victims \u2014 elements familiar from the scenes of many homemade bomb attacks in confined spaces \u2014 are genuinely puzzling at first glance . <PARA> we consulted explosives expert dr . sidney alford about this aspect , who proposed some possible explanations for the absence of damage often observed in homemade bombs . primarily , alford said , the <MASK> he had seen in news reports about the parsons green attack appeared consistent with a tatp ( triacetone triperoxide ) device that simply did not detonate properly . we have highlighted observations made by dr . alford which are particularly relevant to the points made by parsons green conspiracy theorists : <PARA> the crisis actor deleted their post after we sent them a series of questions about it , <MASK> that the text of the post had been copied and pasted from another source which they were unable to find . ( we were also unable to find a precursor to the the crisis actor \u2019 s post .) they accepted that the woman in the photograph is not , in fact , the actor nora kirkpatrick , and asserted that \u201c the [ crisis actor ] page is a satirical take on current events and <MASK> \u201d and \u201c we don \u2019 t intend for people to take things seriously .\u201d nonetheless , similar conspiracy theories about the parsons green attack abound elsewhere on the internet .",

        "text": "<MASK> : many who find solace in spirituals find an additional measure of satisfaction in discovering that cherished songs were penned by folks possessed of colorful histories . songs celebrating the mercy of god seem to mean more when they issue from reformed sinners , so stories that play up that aspect of a song \u2019 s <MASK> are especially prized , even if key points are embellished . <PARA> as was the case with \u201c amazing grace ,\u201d though it is well grounded in fact , the <MASK> of \u201c it is no secret ( what god can do )\u201d has been exaggerated at some points to make for better telling . <PARA> carl stuart hamblen ( the e - mailed account misidentifies him as russ hamblin ) composed and recorded \u201c it is no secret \u201d in 1950 . born in texas in 1908 , hamblen enjoyed a long and successful musical career as a singer / songwriter , with more than two hundred songs to his credit , before he passed away in california in 1989 . hamblen was a heavy drinker who swore off demon rum and made religion a central part of his life in 1949 after attending \u201c youth for christ ,\u201d a historic revival meeting held by the reverend dr . billy graham in los angeles . <PARA> various biographies of both hamblen and graham support the <MASK> of the songwriter \u2019 s having gone to dr . graham \u2019 s hotel room and insisted he be prayed for . according to grady wilson , a lifelong friend and associate of billy graham , after attending the revival meeting earlier that night coming away from it troubled , hamblen and his wife did pay a call on dr . graham at the langham hotel , one block off wilshire boulevard , at 4 a . m ., asking to be saved . wilson reports the singer was \u201c broken up and crying as billy said , \u2018 we \u2019 ve been praying for you for weeks .'\u201d <PARA> hamblen \u2019 s daughter , lisa hamblen jaserie , also supports the tale of the \u201c dark of the night \u201d conversion . <PARA> john wayne \u2019 s connection to the song does appear to be well established . according to stuart hamblen ( and if anyone would know , it would be him ) he did indeed gain his inspiration for \u201c it is no secret \u201d from a response he made to the movie star . hamblen did appear in a number of minor westerns , including some that starred the duke , so they knew each other , at least casually . the inspiration came from a brief conversation at a party : in reply to wayne \u2019 s comment \u201c what \u2019 s this i hear \u2014 you got religion ?,\u201d stuart answered , \u201c it is no secret what god can do in a man \u2019 s life .\u201d the <MORE> all the <MASK> made in the e - mailed version of the song \u2019 s <MASK> hold up . this one , for instance , is clearly <MASK> : <PARA> and along came a young preacher holding a tent revival . hamblin had him on his radio show , presumably to poke fun at him . and to gather more material , hamblin showed up at one of the revival meetings . <PARA> according to dr . graham , he went on stuart hamblen \u2019 s radio show as part of a media push to raise interest in advance of the revival meeting . he and the other organizers of the event were having trouble getting any advance press coverage , so his appearance on hamblen \u2019 s show was a boon to them . and rather than poking fun at the reverend , hamblen told his listeners to \u201c go on down to billy graham \u2019 s tent and hear the preaching .\u201d <PARA> another aspect of this e - mailed account rings <MASK> : it is inaccurate to say of hamblen that \u201c hard times were upon him \u201d after his spiritual awakening . a year after his discovery of the lord , hamblen wrote \u201c it is no secret ,\u201d a tune that brought him tremendous <PARA> <MASK> as it became the first cross - over gospel , country , and pop ballad , reaching the number one spot on all three charts . that same year , he wrote \u201c remember me , i \u2019 m the one who loves you ,\u201d a song which peaked at # 2 on the gospel and country charts and held that position for a full nine weeks . as for \u201c this ole house ,\u201d supposedly the sole bright spot in hamblen \u2019 s career during a period of professional reverses between his conversion and the success of \u201c it is no secret ,\u201d he didn \u2019 t write that song until 1954 , four years after he \u2019 d topped the charts with \u201c it is no secret .\u201d (\u201c this ole house \u201d shouldn \u2019 t be dismissively described as \u201c the only one that had much success \u201d \u2014 it went to # 2 in the country field and stayed on the charts for thirty weeks , while rosemary clooney \u2019 s version went to # 3 in the pop charts and was named song of the year .) <PARA> in the early 1950s hamblen did lose his radio show , the cowboy church of the air , over his refusal to do a commercial promoting alcohol , but his principled stand led the prohibition party to nominate him as their candidate for president of the united <MASK> in 1952 . hamblen racked up nearly 73 , 000 votes and finished fourth in a field of twelve candidates despite appearing on the ballot in only twenty - one <MASK> . <PARA> barbara \u201c gospel \u201d mikkelson",

        "text": "<MASK> : harvard \u2014 one of america \u2019 s oldest and most prestigious institutions of higher learning , and a name synonymous with academic excellence . not surprisingly , given harvard \u2019 s age and <MASK> , a considerable body of lore has accumulated <PARA> about the school , its <MASK> , its policies , and its alumni . even less surprisingly , one of the legends from that body of lore concerns the pinnacle of academic achievement : the difficulty of completing an entire undergraduate degree with perfect grades . we \u2019 d expect this legendary feat to be deemed a rare accomplishment and attributed to someone world - famous in a field of intellectual pursuit , and such is indeed the case , as for many years the <MASK> has circulated that henry kissinger was the last person to graduate from harvard with perfect grades . <PARA> kissinger does indeed have some prestigious accomplishments to his credit , graduating summa cum laude at harvard college in 1950 , and earning ma and phd degrees at harvard university in 1952 and 1954 respectively . from 1954 until 1971 he was a member of the faculty of harvard university ; he left that position to become assistant to the president for national security affairs and later secretary of <MASK> <PARA> in the nixon administration , and he was a recipient of the nobel peace prize 1973 . but was he truly the last person to go all the way through a harvard undergraduate program and receive nothing less than an \u2018 a \u2019 in every course ? <PARA> well , no . in june 2001 , kevin schwartz of roslyn , new york , achieved that distinction , graduating <PARA> with a perfect 15 . 0 grade point average as a government major . two years later his sister , lisa b . schwartz ( also a government major ), accomplished the same feat . and in 2008 , britney lane graduated harvard with a degree in psychology and a 4 . 0 gpa . <PARA> but up until kevin schwartz \u2019 s 2001 accomplishment , had kissinger been the last ? again , no . the news reports about schwartz mentioned that he had been \u201c the first student in nearly two decades \u201d to achieve perfect grades , although they didn \u2019 t identify the previous wonder student . at best , kissinger was the only one to pull off a perfect gpa between 1950 and the early 1980s . <PARA> at the time kissinger graduated , was he the only harvard student to have achieved flawless grade <MASK> ? probably not , since schwartz was \u201c reportedly one of only four in harvard \u2019 s 350 - year <MASK> .\u201d aside from schwartz , the unidentified perfect student of the early 1980s , and kissinger , that still leaves one other contender . <PARA> perhaps this other contender was a later graduate than kissinger , thereby making kissinger the first perfect grader , but at this point we have to consider whether it \u2019 s really <MASK> that kissinger \u2019 s record was perfect . <PARA> according to walter isaacson \u2019 s 1992 book kissinger : a biography , it wasn \u2019 t : kissinger fell just short of an unblemished academic record when he received a b in a relational logic philosophy course . but whether isaacson is right or not , henry kissinger still achieved a tremendously impressive academic record .",

        "text": "on 27 june 2017 , the facebook page of the \u201c special needs animal rescue and rehabilitation \u201d organization ( also called snarr ) posted a photo of people with animals lining up outside a houston , texas animal shelter , purportedly to surrender the pets and have them put down : <PARA> snarr \u2019 s facebook post was subsequently picked up by one green planet web site , whose <MASK> about the topic was headlined : \u201c[ what the hell ]!? people are literally lining up to dump their pets before july 4th weekend .\u201d the pet rescue report got in on the action as well , writing : \u201c heartbreaking reality : owners line up at shelter to surrender their pets before july 4th parties .\u201d <PARA> the facebook post was removed on 1 july 2017 , but had been widely shared , and some commenters began to question the sourcing and veracity of the <MASK> that the owners shown in the photo were all in line to surrender their dogs . many suggested that the demeanor of some of those in line was not indicative of giving up their dogs , and speculated that it was more likely to be a line for wellness checkups . <PARA> beforing removing it , snarr had edited its <MASK> post , specifying that the two men shown in the immediate foreground of the photo left the line in order to have a wellness check - up for their pet , but still suggesting that all the others ( around a dozen in the photo ) were there to surrender theirs . <PARA> we tracked down one of those men , juan martinez of houston , texas , whose identity we were able to verify . martinez told us that he and his brother - in - law ( also pictured ), had visited the bureau of animal regulation and care ( barc ) animal shelter on carr street in houston on the afternoon of 27 june 2017 . we were able to find documents showing that martinez was there to have his mother \u2019 s newly - fostered kitten spayed and given deworming treatment . <PARA> contrary to what the group <MASK> on facebook , martinez said everyone waited in the same line , regardless of the purpose of their visit . although he did not speak to anyone else in line , apart from his brother - in - law , he told us there was a positive atmosphere in the line , and that it was his impression that \u201c nobody was there to drop [ their pets ] off .\u201d <PARA> a snarr spokesperson told us that the organization \u2019 s treasurer took the photo at around noon on 27 june 2017 . the group \u2019 s treasurer was there to help a friend look for a lost dog . the viral facebook post was written by snarr \u2019 s president , lauren connolly . <PARA> we <MORE> public ), three lost dogs returned to their owners , seven dogs fostered out . 102 animals were turned in as strays , 52 dogs were surrendered by their owners , and 57 people visited the foster or wellness clinic with pets . <PARA> of the 211 cases where people brought animals to the shelter that day , 27 % were visiting the foster or wellness clinic , and 73 % were turning in dogs \u2014 either strangers presenting lost or stray dogs , or owners surrendering their pets . so it is <MASK> likely that about three - quarters of any given group waiting in line with animals outside the shelter that day , were turning in stray or unwanted dogs . <PARA> so does this mean that all , or even most , of these dogs will be euthanized ? no . <PARA> snarr \u2019 s facebook post describes , in very emotive , even disturbing terms , the fate that supposedly awaits the animals seen in the photo : <PARA> only 52 out of 211 animals ( 25 percent ) brought to the shelter that day were brought by their owners , to be surrendered . almost twice as many ( 102 ) were strays or lost dogs being brought to the shelter . and finally , more than 80 percent of dogs turned in to the barc shelter \u2014 for whatever reason \u2014 are not put down . <PARA> the shelter \u2019 s spokesperson provided us <MASK> showing that in 2016 , 80 . 4 percent of animals turned in ( either as strays , lost dogs , or by their owners ), were successfully adopted out , returned to their owners or otherwise kept alive . <PARA> ( there is a sliver of irony in this episode . juan martinez , who was in the photo that accompanied snarr \u2019 s inflammatory facebook post , was bringing a fostered kitten to barc for medical care . that kitten was once a stray , and could well have been turned in to the shelter by someone who once waited in line outside , just like those in the photo .) <PARA> the percentage of dogs euthanized was 19 . 6 percent . <PARA> since the total number of dogs turned in on 27 june 2017 was 154 , we can estimate that about 30 ( 19 . 6 percent ) of these will end up being euthanized . and since the total number of animals brought to the center ( including the medical and foster clinic ) was 211 \u2014 this means only around 14 percent will end up being put down . <PARA> in other words , the <MASK> likelihood is this : of the animals waiting outside the barc clinic at any given moment on 27 june 2017 \u2014 the day this viral photo was taken \u2014 the vast majority ( around 86 percent ) were likely not to end up being euthanized .",

        "text": "castoreum ( or castor , not to be confused with the oil of a castor bean ) is a yellowish - brown , unctuous substance with a strong , penetrating odor which beavers secrete from castor sacs located in skin cavities between the pelvis and the base of the tail and spray when scent - marking their territory . ( the location of the beaver \u2019 s castor sacs means that castoreum also often includes a mixture of anal gland secretions and urine as well .) due to the beaver \u2019 s typical diet of leaves and bark , castoreum doesn \u2019 t \u201c stink \u201d as other similar animal secretions do , but rather has a musky , vanilla scent described at the perfume site fragrantica as a \u201c sharp spreading tar - like note that reminds one of the odor of birch tar or russian leather \u201d that when diluted in alcohol picks up \u201c more pleasant , musky and fruity nuances .\u201d <PARA> because of its scent properties castoreum has long been employed in the perfume - making industry , and processed forms of castoreum have also been used as food additives , in the latter case primarily as enhancers of vanilla , strawberry and raspberry flavorings found in products such as iced tea , ice cream , gelatin , candy , fruit - flavored drinks , and yogurt . <PARA> however , the publicity afforded castoreum in recent years via alarmist food activists and \u201c where does vanilla flavouring come from ? and \u201c did you know ?\u201d social media posts is vastly overblown : <PARA> the use of castoreum in common food products today is exceedingly rare , in large part because collecting the substance is difficult ( and therefore expensive ): <PARA> according to fernelli \u2019 s handbook of flavor ingredients , total annual national consumption of castoreum , castoreum extract , and castoreum liquid combined is only about 292 pounds , which works out to an average of less than a millionth of a pound per person in the u . s . compare that figure with the approximately 20 million pounds of vanilla naturally harvested from real vanilla beans every year . depending upon as scarce a substance as castoreum to flavor the ice cream and candy found on store shelves would create nationwide shortages of those items and drive up their prices beyond the reach of all but the wealthiest consumers . <PARA> in 2011 , the vegetarian resource group ( vrg ) queried five companies that produce vanilla flavorings about whether they used any castoreum in their products , and all five replied that they did not : <PARA> castoreum as a food additive is classified by the food and drug administration as \u201c generally recognized as safe \u201d ( gras ), and therefore food manufacturers don \u2019 t always have to include castoreum in their ingredients lists and may instead refer to it as \u201c natural flavoring .\u201d however yucky that may seem , according to a 2007 safety assessment published the international journal of toxicology , consumption of castoreum poses no health risk to humans : <PARA> castoreum does still have a significant market even today , but almost exclusively for the use of the perfume industry , not the food industry .",

assuming judge carter denies obama \u2019 s motion for dismissal , he will likely then order expedited discovery which will force obama to release his birth certificate in a timely manner ( if he has one ). <PARA> the judge , who is a former u . s . marine , repeated several times that this is a very serious case which must be resolved quickly so that the troops know <PARA> that their commander in chief is eligible to hold that position and issue lawful orders to our military in this time of war . he basically said obama must prove his eligibility to the court !

( it \u2019 s natural though to confuse this boy \u2019 s death with the apocryphal <MASK> of an attempted kidnapping from a large store in which the child is drugged , his clothes are changed , and his hair cut and dyed , because that tale has been kicking around forever . one has to but hear \u201c child ,\u201d \u201c abduction \u201d and \u201c store \u201d to bring that well - traveled urban legend immediately to mind . those interested in reading up on that legend should visit the kidnappings page .) <PARA> what follows is excerpted from a 1996 american society for industrial security \u2019 s publication : <PARA> child safety . as mentioned earlier , wal - mart has a child safety program that aims both to prevent abductions and to find children lost in the store . initiated in 1993 , the program is called \u201c code adam \u201d after adam walsh , a child who disappeared in a high - profile abduction case that received nationwide attention . the program establishes a series of steps that store associates can follow if a child is reported missing . <PARA> essentially , the program works like this : when a parent or guardian notifies an employee that his or her child is missing , the associate asks for a detailed description of the child , including name , age , hair color , eye color , approximate weight and height , and what the child is wearing . a shoe description is especially helpful , since shoes are difficult for a kidnapper to change quickly . <PARA> [ barbara \u2019 s note : looks like they \u2019 d heard that legend , too .] <PARA> after obtaining this description , the associate goes to the nearest in - store phone and pages \u201c code adam .\u201d the associate then describes the missing child over the store intercom . the announcement could be something like : \u201c associates , we have a code adam . we have lost a five - year - old boy wearing a red shirt , blue jeans , and black tennis shoes . he <MORE> move to the next stage , searching the parking lot or other stores , questioning people , setting up roadblocks , and the like . <PARA> if the child is found with someone other than the parent or legal guardian , associates are instructed to call the police immediately or ask another employee to call the police and describe the would - be abductor . <PARA> while staff is expected to do everything within reason to prevent an abduction , associates are not expected to \u2013 and are instructed not to \u2013 expose themselves or the child to physical harm . if it is not reasonable to detain the suspected abductor or cause him or her to abandon the child , the associate is expected to get a description of the person , car type , license plate number , departure route , and related information . <PARA> \u201c code adam \u201d was named for adam walsh ., who was abducted from the sears store in hollywood , florida , on 27 july 1981 . his mother left him in the video games section for what she later said was five or seven minutes while she went to a different part of the store to buy a lamp . there are some reports that adam was ordered out of sears by store security as he and some others were making a disturbance and that his abductor encountered him outside the store . <PARA> only the child \u2019 s head has ever been recovered , no other body part . <PARA> i don \u2019 t believe the site of the child \u2019 s murder has ever been determined . <PARA> though the crime remains unsolved , convicted killer ottis elwood toole has twice confessed to it ( and later recanted both confessions ). if we believe he was adam \u2019 s killer and therefore accept his version of the events , he met the child in the store and lured him out to his car with promises of candy and toys . no dye job , no drugged child , none of the standard urban legend stuff . <PARA> but that \u2019 s a big \u201c if .\u201d some reports place toole in a different part of the country at the time of the child \u2019 s murder , and there is also reputed to be another plausible suspect in the case . on the other hand , henry lee lucas ( toole \u2019 s lover ) <MASK> toole had shown him the shallow grave where he said walsh \u2019 s remains were buried . ( as to how much weight to give these <MASK> , lucas and toole have confessed to over 200 murders , some of which they \u2019 ve been proved not to have committed .) <PARA> ottis elwood toole is no longer available for questioning though . he died on 15 september 1996 of cirrhosis of the liver . <PARA> barbara \u201c dead to rites \u201d mikkelson",

( particularly , many consumers have very different ideas of what terms such as \u201c freezer safe \u201d and \u201c microwave safe \u201d mean , ideas which are often not in accordance with government or manufacturer definitions .) contrary to strong consumer perception , neither pyrex glass bakeware nor any other brand is \u201c indestructible \u201d and should not be used in a manner that assumes it to be so . <PARA> the e - mail <MASK> above <MASK> that the writer \u201c googled exploding pyrex dishes and got ten million hits . exploding pyrex is very common .\u201d as noted above , all glass bakeware is subject to thermal shock breakage ; when this type of sudden breakage occurs , especially when accompanied by a sharp , loud sound , it is commonly described by consumers as an \u201c explosion .\u201d the reference to \u201c ten million \u201d search hits is a gross exaggeration , but many accounts of sudden breakage incidents involving pyrex brand glass bakeware can be found on the internet and elsewhere : chicago <MASK> wbbm - tv reported in 2008 that the consumer product safety commission ( cpsc ) had received 66 complaints <MORE> to borosilicate glass : <PARA> some critics have maintained , nonetheless , that modern pyrex brand glass bakeware is involved in a disproportionate number of dangerous shattering incidents , that it is inadequately tempered , and that the company \u2019 s product instructions are insufficient . however , others ( including world kitchen ) have criticized such <MASK> as misleading , conjectural ones based on anecdote and misuse rather than on hard <MASK> and reliable documentation of manufacturing flaws . \\ <PARA> in january 2011 , consumer reports published test results documenting that borosilicate glass bakeware was indeed more resistant to thermal shock breakage than heat - treated soda lime bakeware , but they acknowledged that their test conditions were \u201c contrary to instructions \u201d provided on the manufacturers \u2019 labels . <PARA> world kitchen itself <MASK> that it has received complaints from only \u201c a very small number of consumers \u201d about unexpected breakage , and notes that the cpsc has in fact found no safety issue with pyrex glass bakeware : <PARA> in a january 2011 <MASK> , consumer reports interviewed persons involved in 163 glass bakeware shattering incidents ( some of whom admitted that they were using the bakeware \u201c against the safety instructions for any brand , including the <MASK> version of pyrex \u201d) and noted that the cpsc had found \u201c 268 reports of [ emergency room ] visits for glass bakeware injuries \u201d in a sample of er visits from 1998 through 2007 but did not provide a breakdown of the brands involved or the conditions under which the injuries occurred ( while acknowledging that the <MASK> included \u201c injuries from glassware breaking when dropped \u201d). the cpsc estimated that a total of 11 , 882 such injuries had occurred nationwide during that period based on their sample size . <PARA> the e - mail <MASK> above also <MASK> in a tag line that \u201c world kitchen is not a usa company ,\u201d and its reference to china has led many readers to infer that all pyrex brand bakeware is now manufactured in that country . however , world kitchen , which now owns such popular kitchenware and tableware brands as chicago cutlery , corelle , corningware , magnalite , pyrex , and revere , is a subsidiary of wki holding co . wki is headquartered in rosemont , illinois , and manufactures products in the u . s .

        "text": "<MASK> : when embroiled in difficulty , even those who are not all that religious will at times find themselves appealing for help through the serenity prayer . this simple three - fold entreaty to the powers that be asks for three things : <PARA> serenity , courage and wisdom . yet there is far more to the prayer than that : its very nature teaches that any of those three qualities would not only fail to help at various times , but would even add to the problems at hand . application of the courage to change things in one \u2019 s life , for instance , would lead only to further heartbreak and suffering when applied to a quandary where the solution lies outside one \u2019 s abilities to influence matters . similarly , serenely accepting bad situations and treatment that could be altered only works to leave that person trapped and helpless within the current mess . and the wisdom to discern the one from the other is useless if not acted upon . <PARA> the prayer casts light upon this simple concept even as it counsels tranquility in the face of matters we can do nothing about and bold , decisive moves in the face of those we can . it serves to clarify the thoughts of many during times of trouble when all is confusion , suffering , and doubt in that it provides an answer \u2014 or at least a tool that can be used to help find an answer \u2014 to what can be done and what cannot . <PARA> it \u2019 s therefore natural to want to ascribe authorship of something so powerful to an important personage from the distant past . yet it was not penned by st . augustine ( 354 - 430 ), the first bishop of hippo and arguably the most influential of the early church fathers of the christian church . nor was its author cicero , boethius , marcus aurelius , thomas aquinas , francis of assisi , or thomas more . <PARA> this simple yet expressive prayer wasn \u2019 t laid down in antiquity by one of the most famous people of his day ; it was instead written in the early 1930s by reinhold niebuhr , an american theologian . while its wording has changed across the span of those eighty - plus years between then and now , even its earliest forms are clearly recognizable as the serenity prayer : <PARA> [ 1940 ] <PARA> o god , give us the serenity to accept what cannot be changed , <PARA> the courage to change what can be changed , <PARA> and the wisdom to know the one from the other <PARA> o god , give us the serenity to accept what cannot be changed , <PARA> the courage to change what can be changed , <PARA> and the wisdom to know the one from the other <PARA> time and widespread use have served to tighten its wording into its best known form ( as <MASK> in the example section above ), but at one point a longer version also existed : <PARA> god , give me grace to accept with serenity <PARA> the things that cannot be changed , <PARA> courage to change the things <PARA> which should be changed , <PARA> and the wisdom to distinguish <PARA> the one from the other . <PARA> living one day at a time , <PARA> enjoying one moment at a time , <PARA> accepting hardship as a pathway to peace , <PARA> taking , as jesus did , <PARA> this sinful world as it is , <PARA> not as i would have it , <PARA> trusting that you will make all things right , <PARA> if i surrender to your will , <PARA> so that i may be reasonably happy in this life , <PARA> and supremely happy with you forever in the next . <PARA> amen . <PARA> living one day at a time , <PARA> enjoying one moment at a time , <PARA> accepting hardship as a pathway to peace , <PARA> taking , as jesus did , <PARA> this sinful world as it is , <PARA> not as i would have it , <PARA> trusting that you will make all things right , <PARA> if i surrender to your will , <PARA> so that i may be reasonably happy in this life , <PARA> and supremely happy with you forever in the next . <PARA> amen . <PARA> the prayer was assisted in achieving a great measure of its renown through its association with alcoholics anonymous . these days , most aa meetings begin or end with a recitation of the serenity prayer , an act that serves to further propagate its spread . as to how the prayer came to be taken up by that organization , after an aa member happened upon it in the new york herald tribune in 1941 ( where it appeared as a caption within a routine obituary ), co - founder william griffith wilson ( bill w .) had it printed on wallet - sized cards and included in every piece of mail leaving aa \u2019 s head office . as bill w . said , \u201c never had we seen so much a . a . in so few words .\u201d <PARA> barbara \u201c wisdom of the aegis \u201d mikkelson",

        "text": "on 2 april 2019 , u . s . president donald trump referred to u . s . rep . alexandria ocasio - cortez as a \u201c young bartender \u201d during a fundraising dinner for the national republican congressional committee . trump was , of course , hardly the first to paint ocasio - cortez as inexperienced or unqualified for her position in congress . ever since she became the youngest woman to be elected to that legislative body during the 2018 midterm elections , we \u2019 ve encountered dozens of posts about her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 . <PARA> one of the biggest talking points among ocasio - cortez \u2019 s detractors is that she is uneducated . for example , fox news \u2019 tucker carlson labeled her a \u201c moron \u201d during a segment on his show , the powerline blog published an <MASK> under the rhetorical title \u201c how dumb is ocasio - cortez ?\u201d and numerous social media users have posted their own derogatory comments insulting the congresswoman \u2019 s intelligence . <PARA> this rhetoric likely helped sow the seeds of doubt over ocasio - cortez \u2019 s academic record . one email we received here at snopes , for instance , questioned whether the congresswoman truly had an economics degree : \u201c much to do about aoc \u2014 ocasio cortez \u2014 of late and questions about her college degree ? we read she actually did not get an econ degree , but an international relations degree . if so , much of her credibility is in question . what is real here ?\u201d <PARA> the satirical babylon bee added a bit more confusion to the situation when they latched onto the criticism and published an <MASK> <MASK> that the congresswoman \u2019 s economics degree had been revoked . <PARA> here is the reality : ocasio - cortez truly graduated cum laude from boston university in 2011 . in an <MASK> about distinguished alumni , the university wrote that \u201c ocasio - cortez graduated from boston university in 2011 with a ba in international relations and economics .\u201d <PARA> we reached out to the university to clarify the issue : did she earn a degree in international relations with a focus in economics ? or did she major in both international relations and economics ? they indicated that the latter was <MASK> . <PARA> a spokesperson for the university told us : \u201c she graduated in 2011 with a bachelor of arts degree with two majors in international relations and economics . latin honors awarded was cum laude that is not tied to an individual major but the degree .\u201d <PARA> a spokesperson for the congresswoman added : \u201c she was awarded a double major [ degree ] in both international relations and economics .\u201d <PARA> it seems relevant to note that possessing a college degree is not a requirement for becoming a member of the house of representatives in the u . s . congress . the only <MORE> page \u201c occupy democrats \u201d summed up a few of the <MASK> about ocasio - cortez \u2019 s alleged accomplishments : <PARA> the <MASK> made in this meme are largely accurate . <PARA> in high school , she won 2nd place at the intel international science and engineering fair <PARA> before she became a congresswoman , ocasio - cortez was a high school student with an interest in microbiology . while the <MASK> reproduced above is largely accurate , we have one small caveat about it : ocasio - cortez won second place in the microbiology category at the intel international science and engineering fair ( isef ), not second place overall for the entire fair . <PARA> the society for science and the public , the organization that hosts isef , wrote about ocasio - cortez \u2019 s accomplishment in a 7 november 2018 <MASK> and congratulated their former contestant on her congressional victory : <PARA> in a show of appreciation for her efforts , the mit lincoln laboratory named a small asteroid after her : 23238 ocasio - cortez <PARA> ocasio - cortez may have have not won first place at isef , but her efforts didn \u2019 t go unnoticed . mit was apparently impressed enough with her work that they named a small asteroid after her . <PARA> the congresswoman posted about this unique achievement on twitter : <PARA> readers interested in the specifics of this asteroid can read more about it on the website of nasa \u2019 s jet propulsion laboratory ( jpl ). for those only interested in how the asteroid got its name , nasa included this note at the bottom of their page : <PARA> she attended boston university , where she had a john f . lopez fellowship <PARA> the john f . lopez fellowship ( jfl ) program is offered by the national hispanic institute and is available to undergraduate students who \u201c demonstrate leadership potential , willingness to face challenges , and ability to share talent and skill with the hispanic / latino community .\u201d nhi magazine noted ocasio - cortez \u2019 s time as a jfl intern when they named her the national hispanic institute \u2019 s \u201c person of the year \u201d in 2017 : <PARA> during college , she interned in the immigration office for u . s . senator ted kennedy <PARA> ocasio - cortez has talked about her internship in senator ted kennedy \u2019 s office on numerous occasions . she \u2019 s posted about it on twitter and has discussed the experience in various interviews . <PARA> here \u2019 s how she described her internship in the foreign affairs and immigration office of senator kennedy in a 2018 <MASK> published by mic : <PARA> boston university \u2019 s profile of the congresswoman on their \u201c distinguished alumni \u201d page also notes that \u201c during her time at bu , she was an intern in the immigration office of us senator ted kennedy .\u201d",

        "text": "<MASK> : john denver \u2019 s father , henry john deutschendorf , was one of the first officers in the newly - formed united <MASK> air <PARA> force after world war ii , retiring as a lieutenant colonel . his son ( now known as john denver ) at one time had hopes of joining the air force himself , but his substandard eyesight precluded his becoming a military pilot . john denver received an army induction notice in 1964 , but he was classified 1 - y due to having lost two toes in a lawn mower accident and never served in any branch of the military . <PARA> the john denver \u201c sniper \u201d <MASK> is a typical example of the \u201c he \u2019 s not what he seems to be \u201d legend type , tales of contradictory excess generally applied to celebrities who entertain children or otherwise have a cloying public image that show them to be the opposites of their public images . ( other examples include uncle don and singer mariah carey .) thus john denver , known to the world as a gentle , nature - loving pop singer , is transformed into his antithesis : a professional killer . ( as was fred rogers of television \u2019 s mister rogers \u2019 neighborhood . he too was <MASK> to have been a sniper , with even his penchant for long - sleeved cardigans ascribed to his hiding tattoos from the eyes of curious little tykes . like denver , rogers never served in any branch of the military . he was an ordained minister in the united presbyterian church .) <PARA> consider the possible thought processes of whoever invented this <MASK> : \u201c hey , let \u2019 s make up something outrageous about that wimp john denver ! i know , we \u2019 ll <PARA> tell everybody he used to shoot people !\u201d casting john denver as a hired killer for the mob being a bit too far - fetched , the <MASK> - mongers decide to present him as a soldier . ( an apt touch , since the controversial vietnam war had created a decidedly negative image of the military in the minds of a large segment of american youth in the early 1970s , when denver \u2019 s career was at its peak .) offering denver as a sniper was a double stroke of genius : it created the impression that not only was he a soldier , but that he actually shot people ( since plenty of military personnel serve in support of combat operations without ever firing a gun ); and it painted a picture of denver not just as a killer , but as a cowardly one who hid in buildings and shot unsuspecting victims . ( military snipers are actually well - trained professional soldiers who perform a difficult , demanding , and vital task at no small risk to themselves , but the civilian public \u2019 s general perception of a sniper , however , is someone like charles whitman : a man with a long - range rifle holed up in an impregnable tower , mercilessly gunning down defenseless , unarmed people .) <PARA> the fact that denver was the son of a career military officer and was of the right age to have served in the vietnam war most likely afforded this legend just the right touch of plausibility it needed to spread widely .",

only the red dorsal stripe distinguishes them . <PARA> redbacks are found everywhere throughout the australian continent , especially alongside human habitation . <PARA> only females build webs . their smaller , less brilliantly colored male counterparts often lurk to the side . <PARA> humans must be careful . the spider won \u2019 t seek out people to sting , but should a hand stray into her web by accident , a trip to the emergency room may be in order as the venom acts directly on the nerves . <PARA> only the female bite is dangerous , and their bites have caused some human deaths . <PARA> the redback possesses a potent neurotoxic venom . it does not hunt its prey , but instead waits for a tasty morsel to wander by and become entangled in its web . <PARA> once the prey - usually a walking insect - becomes enmeshed in the redback \u2019 s web , it \u2019 s wrapped in silk . when it \u2019 s time to eat , the spider bites down on its intended victim , injecting its neurotoxic venom . the venom paralyzes the insect , and digestive enzymes begin to dissolve the prey \u2019 s insides . <PARA> antivenom for redback spider bites has been available since 1956 , and no known deaths directly attributable to redback bites have been documented in more than fifty years since then , which makes this latest case in ireland quite a subject of interest . however , note that the victim \u2019 s wife , jeanne , <MASK> her husband didn \u2019 t die soon after being bitten by a spider ; he had actually been bitten a year earlier , and then he experienced a long period of declining health with various symptoms before finally passing away in july 2014 : <PARA> \u201c but the bite he got had bled very badly . we went through a roll and a half of toilet roll to try and stop it . <PARA> \u201c ever since his health went down . <PARA> \u201c his stomach started swelling , they said it was his liver and his pancreas . <PARA> \u201c his testicles also swelled up very bad .\u201d <PARA> jeanne , 46 , went on to describe how john \u2019 s eyesight deteriorated and he started vomiting blood . <PARA> he eventually died in hospital last month and an inquest into his death has begun \u2014 but jeanne is already convinced it was the spider . <PARA> \u201c it had to be down to that sting . <PARA> \u201c he was in perfect health before the bite happened .\u201d <PARA> so there \u2019 s as yet no certainty that john francis kennedy was actually bitten by a redback spider , which had not previously been sighted in ireland , other than someone \u2019 s year - old recollection of what the spider in question looked like . and even if that species of spider did deliver a bite to the victim , it \u2019 s unproven at this point that his death was directly attributable to that bite . he may have died from something else completely coincidental to that bite , he may have been suffering from an undiagnosed medical condition that had already compromised his health and was exacerbated or compounded by the bite \u2019 s effects , or he may have suffered an allergic reaction to the bite ( rather than being killed by the venom itself ) \u2014 a host of alternative explanations are possible . <PARA> until additional ( and less tabloid - sensational ) details are provided about this case , it \u2019 s far too early to <MASK> this as a verified example of a redback spider bite death in ireland . and for those locals who fear that such critters are taking up residence in the area : <PARA> currently there are no national records of redback spider sightings .",

        "text": "<MASK> : exactly who wrote this evocative and well - crafted letter chiding president clinton for calling on older generations to \u201c learn sacrifice as other generations have done \u201d remains a mystery . it has appeared in the print media , on the radio , and throughout the internet in several variant forms , credited to a variety of writers . the version most frequently cited on the internet is attributed to a retired air force lt . colonel from colorado springs named robert j . grady and reportedly ran in the ( now defunct ) public intelligence review and newsletter on 30 july 1994 . it also appeared in st . petersburg times in 1996 , where it was credited to otho e . hays of clearwater , florida ; was printed in the cleveland plain dealer ( also in 1996 ) under the name of kitty dowdell ; and was awarded the december 1997 \u201c letter of the month \u201d honor by the seattle times , who cited its author as one joe regan of kirkland . even stranger , the letter was reportedly read by actor charlton heston on rush limbaugh \u2019 s radio show on 31 may 1994 , before its earliest known <PARA> publication . <PARA> whoever its author , this letter is a heady reminder that previous generations endured times of hardship and crisis that those of us who have enjoyed only an era of economic booms and peaceful security find it hard to imagine . ( the post - world war ii era has not been completely free of economic downturns , armed conflicts , and various other crises , of course .) this piece has become a favorite of conservative critics and radio talk show hosts , with heston \u2019 s readings being especially popular . but was it prompted by a real remark of clinton \u2019 s , or merely something the writer ( and others of similar sentiment ) mistakenly assumed he said ? <PARA> the intended irony here is in president clinton \u2014 a man who wasn \u2019 t born until well after the depression and world war ii were over , has enjoyed living in a country with a strong economy throughout most of his lifetime , and avoided military service during the vietnam war \u2014 <MASK> that , for the good of the country , \u201c the older generation must learn to sacrifice as other generations have done .\u201d however , one searches in vain to find <MASK> that clinton ever made any such <MASK> . the earliest attribution of this letter ( 31 may 1994 ) narrows the timeframe in which he could have said these words , but nothing resembling this <MASK> turns up in any major news database . nor does this <MASK> sound like anything the politically astute clinton would have been foolish enough to utter . ( if nothing else , clinton \u2019 s recent impeachment and lawsuit troubles have demonstrated how carefully he chooses his words .) <PARA> perhaps the writer was responding to something that was erroneously reported as having been said by clinton , a <MASK> by someone in the white house administration other than clinton , or a putative summarization of clinton \u2019 s policies ( real or imagined ). one of the main points of the letter , however , is a pointed attack on the alleged hypocrisy of president clinton ; as such , the letter should be based on something he actually said , not what someone wants to believe he said . <PARA> additional information :",

year investigation into planned parenthood \u2019 s practice of selling aborted fetus parts and captured a conversation that took place in july 2014 in which dr . nucatola discussed how organs were preserved during the abortion process with an eye towards later sale : <PARA> it \u2019 s unclear why the video was held for over a year before it was released , and it has some curious aspects to it . for starters , it opens with a news report and footage of planned parenthood president gloria feldt condemning \u201c inappropriate behavior ,\u201d presented in a manner that made feldt \u2019 s <MASK> seem like she was commenting on the current issue even though the <MASK> was actually more than a decade old . <PARA> when planned parenthood faced similar accusations in 2003 , feldt , who was president of the organization from 1996 to 2005 ( and not at any time during the alleged three -

        "text": "on the ( thankfully rare ) occasions when congress must consider whether the sitting president of the united <MASK> has committed misdeeds that merit his forced removal from office , the task of initiating the impeachment process rests with the house judiciary committee : <PARA> in 1973 , after the senate select committee on campaign activities \u2019 investigation into the break - in at the democratic national committee ( dnc ) headquarters at the watergate office complex in washington , d . c ., brought forth <MASK> that the nixon administration ( including the president himself ) had attempted to cover - up its involvement with the crime , the house judiciary committee opened an an impeachment inquiry . <PARA> at that time , the judiciary committee comprised 37 members of the house of representatives and was chaired by representative peter rodino , jr ., of new jersey . the judiciary committee was assisted by a permanent staff , on which attorney jerry zeifman served as chief counsel , and ( for this occasion ) by a separate impeachment inquiry staff assembled to determine whether president nixon had committed impeachable offenses . that inquiry staff was headed by former u . s . justice department lawyer john doar , and one of his hires was a 26 - year - old yale law school graduate then known by her maiden name of hillary rodham ( who a few years later would marry future arkansas governor and u . s . president bill clinton ). <PARA> a pair of <MASK> published during hillary clinton \u2019 s run for the presidency in 2008 , one by northstar writers group founder dan calabrese and one by jerry zeifman himself , asserted and implied that zeifman was hillary \u2019 s supervisor during the watergate investigation and that he eventually fired her from the investigation for \u201c unethical , dishonest \u201d conduct . however , whatever zeifman may have thought of hillary and her work during the investigation , he was not her supervisor , neither he nor anyone else fired her from her position on the impeachment inquiry staff ( zeifman in fact didn \u2019 t have the power to fire her , even had he wanted to do so ), his description of her conduct as \u201c unethical \u201d and \u201c dishonest \u201d is his personal , highly subjective characterization , and the \u201c facts \u201d on which he based that characterization were ones that he contradicted himself about on multiple occasions . <PARA> zeifman said he maintained a transcribed diary during the impeachment proceedings , which he drew up upon two decades later in authoring the 1998 book without honor : the impeachment of president nixon and the crimes of camelot . that book makes it clear that zeifman did not like ( personally and professionally ) a good many of the people he worked with during the watergate investigation ; in particular , he continually butted heads over issues of procedures <MORE> including hillary rodham ) who were no longer needed once the impeachment inquiry was finally called off due to nixon \u2019 s resignation . but as noted above , zeifman had no authority to \u201c fire \u201d hillary ( i . e ., dismiss her for cause ). hillary rodham and zeifman were members of different staffs , and zeifman had no hiring or firing authority over members of the impeachment inquiry staff for which hillary worked . ( that authority rested with special counsel john doar and , ultimately , with house judiciary committee chairman peter rodino .) <PARA> quite tellingly , zeifman made absolutely no mention of having \u201c fired \u201d or \u201c terminated \u201d hillary rodham , nor of telling her that he \u201c could not recommend her for any further positions ,\u201d in his 1995 book \u2014 he only started making those <MASK> much later . back in 1995 he noted that hillary had remained with the inquiry staff up until the end , leaving only when president nixon \u2019 s august 1974 resignation made the issue of impeachment moot and the judiciary committee \u2019 s impeachment inquiry staff was therefore disbanded ( i . e ., the personnel were technically \u201c terminated \u201d because their task had been completed , not on account of any wrongdoing ): <PARA> and again in 1998 , zeifman was <MASK> in a scripps howard news service <MASK> as unambiguously confirming that not only did he not \u201c fire \u201d hillary , but that it was not even within his power to do so : <PARA> zeifman made no bones about having an ax to grind with hillary clinton ( putting out the anti - clinton paperback hillary \u2019 s pursuit of power in 2006 ), and as its blade grew sharper over the years , he quite obviously shifted his recollections of events from the 1973 - 74 timeframe to conform to his later point of view rather than the other way around . <PARA> back in april 2008 , hillary clinton \u2019 s presidential campaign site responded to zeifman \u2019 s <MASK> by asserting : <PARA> they also noted that the washington post \u2018 s reviewer found ( as we did ) much of zeifman \u2019 s book to be mere repetition of speculation with little or no <MASK> to substantiate it : <PARA> if more <MASK> is needed , the pay records of the house judiciary committee put paid to any <MASK> that zeifman ( or anyone else ) ever \u201c fired \u201d hillary rodham from her position with that body . the committee issued their final impeachment report on 22 august 1974 and then wound down their work ( which had already been rendered largely moot by president nixon \u2019 s resignation two weeks earlier ), yet hillary rodham is shown as having been paid through 4 september 1974 \u2014 so clearly she was with the committee all the way through to its substantive end :",

we found no <MASK> of any deal between mexico and argentina being announced during that time period . however , talks have been ongoing between the two countries . <PARA> in the spring of 2017 , mexico \u2019 s deputy economy minister juan carlos baker made several comments in interviews about his country \u2019 s negotiations with argentina and brazil . on 26 march 2017 , the financial times reported : <PARA> the following month , baker told reuters that a deal with argentina could be finalized by the end of 2017 : <PARA> a trade deal between mexico and argentina may be in the works , but it has not yet been announced as of 1 november 2017 . however , assuming a deal goes ahead to shift mexico \u2019 s importation of certain products from the united <MASK> to argentina , the numbers are significant \u2014 but not as dramatic as they are in the meme . <PARA> according to united <MASK> grain council <MASK> , the united <MASK> exported $ 2 . 5 billion worth of corn to mexico in 2015 and 2016 . in 2015 , the united <MASK> exported $ 2 . 9 billion worth of soy products to mexico , according to the u . s . soybean export council ( page 19 <MORE> so even if mexico did decide to stop importing all these products from the u . s ., the likely annual financial cost to the american agriculture industry would be extremely significant , but still only around half the $ 13 billion <MASK> . <PARA> it \u2019 s not entirely clear where the figure of $ 13 billion came from , but it might have <MASK> in an october 2017 letter sent to commerce secretary wilbur ross , and signed by dozens of food and agriculture companies and industry associations , warning ross about the dangers , as they see them , of withdrawing from nafta . <PARA> the study mentioned here was an august 2017 working paper produced by the economic consulting firm impactecon . it did not actually mention any figure of $ 13 billion . rather , it projected that over the course of two to three years after a u . s . withdrawal from nafta , real gdp in the united <MASK> would fall by as much as 0 . 09 percent . <PARA> gross domestic product , or gdp , is the combined market value of all goods and services produced in a particular geographic area ( in this case , the united <MASK> .) it is a calculation commonly used to measure the total size of an economy . real gdp is gross domestic product adjusted for inflation \u2013 meaning , roughly speaking , the size of the economy in relation to the cost of living . <PARA> as of the third quarter of 2017 ( when the impactecon report was published ), the real gdp of the united <MASK> was $ 17 . 01 trillion , according to figures from the bureau of economic analysis . a 0 . 09 percent decline in that would amount to a $ 15 . 3 billion loss \u2014 not far off the $ 13 billion posited by the food and agriculture industry , in their letter . <PARA> there are a couple of things to note here : firstly , the 0 . 09 percent decline estimated in the impactecon report relates to the entire u . s . economy , and not \u201c the farm sector alone ,\u201d as mentioned in the letter . <PARA> in fact , the working paper projects a very small increase in production for the crops and forestry sector ( 0 . 04 percent , page 20 ), accompanied by a significant boost to production in the sugar sector ( 5 . 11 percent ), but it also projects production declines of between one and two percent in the meat , food and livestock and fishing sectors . <PARA> secondly , this real gdp declined is projected to happen \u201c in the next 2 - 3 years \u201d, so if the meme is using the letter to wilbur ross as the source of its $ 13 billion figure , it is misrepresenting the decline as happening \u201c annually .\u201d",

        "text": "when economic conditions are tough and / or the price of gasoline rises substantially , the suggestion that already financially pinched consumers aren \u2019 t even getting a fair shake at the pump is enough to make anyone see red . so , it \u2019 s not surprising that the warning <MASK> below and its variations about \u201c cheating at gas pumps \u201d quickly gained widespread currency in april 2008 as gasoline prices edged towards $ 4 . 00 per gallon , and began hitting inboxes again during an ongoing economic downturn in may 2009 : <PARA> examples : <PARA> variations : <PARA> it \u2019 s difficult to verify whether some anonymous person in georgia truly encountered a malfunctioning gas pump one day in april 2008 ( and whether his report of same was accurate ), but the georgia department of agriculture told us at that time that the pumps at the <MASK> referenced in the <MASK> e - mail had been checked by that agency \u2019 s fuel and measures section in november 2007 and were re - checked ( in response to this e - mail ) in may 2008 , and in both cases they were found to be operating according to standards : <PARA> since this message conflates two distinctly different issues ( whether gas pumps accurately report the amount of gasoline dispensed vs . whether gas pumps accurately register the proper charge for the amount of gasoline dispensed ), we \u2019 ll address them by discussing some general factors involved in the dispensing of gasoline . <PARA> vendors of gasoline are subject to a variety of <MASK> and federal laws requiring them to maintain adequately calibrated dispensing equipment and calling for periodic inspections by government regulatory agencies to ensure that they are in compliance with said laws . however , this does not guarantee that every gas pump you might encounter will necessarily be accurate , for a variety of reasons : some agencies may not have the funds to regularly carry out required inspections at every location , regulators \u2019 equipment might itself be inaccurate , understaffed agencies may not be able to adequately enforce compliance with regulations , etc . <PARA> furthermore , instances of malfunctioning or improperly calibrated pumps are not necessarily indicators that a particular gasoline vendor is \u201c cheating .\u201d such irregularities may be due to worn - out equipment which can be difficult to spot ( and is about as likely to cheat the vendor as it is the customer ), such as the common occurrence of worn check valves : <PARA> unfortunately , much of the responsibility for spotting such irregularities and reporting them to regulatory agencies falls upon consumers themselves , and it isn \u2019 t always easy for the average consumer to notice problems like the ones described in the above - <MASK> message . determining whether a particular pump is correctly reporting the amount of gasoline dispensed can be rather difficult , especially if the difference is relatively small \u2014 just about all consumers can do in this area is to be aware of how much gasoline their vehicles should take at various fuel gauge level readings and note whether the reported number of gallons they buy corresponds to this number . ( that is , if you know your car typically takes seven gallons to fill when your gas gauge needle is on the halfway mark , you should be concerned if a half - tank fill - up suddenly takes eight or nine gallons instead . note that you need to learn this system by trial and error : because gas gauge needles do not necessarily move at an even rate across the full range between \u201c f \u201d and \u201c e \u201d, you can \u2019 t assume that a car with a 14 - gallon gas tank will necessarily take exactly seven gallons to fill when the needle sits on the halfway mark .) <PARA> it \u2019 s much easier to determine whether pumps are accurately registering the proper charge for the amount of gasoline dispensed simply by multiplying the number of gallons you buy by the price per gallon . ( if you can \u2019 t easily do this calculation in your head , you can either use a calculator or employ the suggested method of noting the total dollar charge at the moment the pump reads exactly ten gallons dispensed .) but of course , catching this sort of problem is only possible if the pump is accurately reporting the amount of gasoline dispensed , which , as noted above , is usually much more difficult to determine . ( it can also be the case that gas pumps which test as correctly calibrated when dispensing , say , five gallons of gasoline may not necessarily test as correctly calibrated when dispensing smaller or larger amounts of fuel .) <PARA> for now , though , it \u2019 s generally the case that the retail gasoline industry has a number of other ( and bigger ) problems to deal with , and that consumers have not ( so far ) been very aggressive in reporting the problems they might encounter :",

        "text": "<MASK> : the above - displayed picture comes from the fiesta de san ferm\u00edn , a festival held every year between 6 july and 14 july in pamplona , spain , to commemorate san ferm\u00edn , a 3rd - century saint who was martyred in being dragged <PARA> through the streets of pamplona by bulls . one of the highlights of the festival \u2014 and the event most well - known to the rest of the world ( due <PARA> in large part to its popularization through the writings of ernest hemingway ) \u2014 is the encierro , known in english as the \u201c running of the bulls .\u201d <PARA> each day \u2019 s san ferm\u00edn festivities include afternoon bullfights , and at 8 a . m . every morning the bulls to be used in that afternoon \u2019 s fights are set loose from a corral and herded about a half - mile through the cobbled streets of the town for a three - to four - minute run to the plaza de toros bullfighting stadium . many festival celebrants ( mostly young males ) choose to demonstrate their courage and physical prowess by donning white garb , tying red handkerchiefs about their necks , and running ahead of the group of charging bulls for as long as they can . others opt for somewhat safer ways to experience the thrill of participation : running only a very short portion of the course , running behind the bulls , standing in the street and ducking safely into doorways just as the bulls run past , or simply lining the streets for close - up views of the proceedings . <PARA> most years at least a few participants end up being gored or otherwise injured during the encierro ( at least thirteen people have been killed during the event since 1924 ), and 2007 was no exception . during what was described as \u201c the longest and bloodiest morning bull run \u201d during the festival , thirteen people , including a pair of american brothers ( 23 - year - old michael lenahan of philadelphia , pennsylvania , and 26 - year - old lawrence lenahan of hermosa beach , california ), were injured by bulls : <PARA> they were at a section of the run called \u201c deadman \u2019 s curve ,\u201d where they let the pack of bulls pass them and started running behind them . <PARA> \u201c one bull unexpectedly broke from the pack ,\u201d said lawrence . \u201c the next thing we knew , there was a bull charging us from behind , about ten feet [ away ]. they \u2019 re so fast .\u201d <PARA> the angry , and no doubt frightened , animal gored both brothers . <PARA> lawrence suffered an eight - inch gash in his backside , while michael took a horn in his right leg , the horn entering on his shin and tearing through skin and tissue up to his knee . <PARA> \u201c it was total chaos for a minute or two ,\u201d lawrence continued . \u201c my brother came yelling at me , and i was hollering at him . i saw that his leg was completely open . it was ripped open . you could see everything inside . and so we knew we had a problem ... i was eventually tackled and we were thrown in an ambulance .\u201d <PARA> \u201c one bull unexpectedly broke from the pack ,\u201d said lawrence . \u201c the next thing we knew , there was a bull charging us from behind , about ten feet [ away ]. they \u2019 re so fast .\u201d <PARA> the angry , and no doubt frightened , animal gored both brothers . <PARA> lawrence suffered an eight - inch gash in his backside , while michael took a horn in his right leg , the horn entering on his shin and tearing through skin and tissue up to his knee . <PARA> \u201c it was total chaos for a minute or two ,\u201d lawrence continued . \u201c my brother came yelling at me , and i was hollering at him . i saw that his leg was completely open . it was ripped open . you could see everything inside . and so we knew we had a problem ... i was eventually tackled and we were thrown in an ambulance .\u201d <PARA> as shown in the above photograph , a 24 - year - old norwegian , christopher neiff , suffered a similar injury when a bull \u2019 s horn slid under his shin and tore the skin up to his knee .",

        "text": "net neutrality is the principle behind a set of federal communications commission ( fcc ) regulations enacted during the obama administration mandating that internet service providers treat all online platforms , content and users equally . simply put , the rules kept providers from setting fees and transmission speeds that favored some content sources over others . proponents say net neutrality rules ensure fair competition and guarantee unimpeded access to all legal platforms and content for all users . <PARA> current trump - appointed fcc chairman ajit pai has been critical of net neutrality ( also known as \u201c open internet \u201d), deriding it as an overly restrictive and unnecessary set of regulations that is akin to \u201c micromanaging \u201d the internet . he has long argued that removing the 2015 restrictions would benefit consumers and the economy . fcc commissioners voted in favor of pai \u2019 s proposal to scrap net neutrality on 14 december 2017 . <PARA> fittingly , nowhere are the consequences of repealing the open internet rules more hotly debated than on the internet . one of net neutrality \u2019 s more fervent defenders in congress , rep . ro khanna ( d - california ), tweeted the following on 26 october : <PARA> the graphic khanna used , a screen shot of a promotion on the web site of the portuguese telecom company meo , purports to illustrate one of the end - user scenarios net neutrality backers have long predicted would come to pass in the absence of such regulations : limited offerings of pre - selected apps and content packages , with add - on charges for each ( comparable to service bundles offered by cable tv providers ). want to view videos ? pay extra . want to use facebook and twitter ? pay extra . and so on . <PARA> khanna \u2019 s example was quickly seized upon by open internet advocates who shared the screen shot along with commentaries contrasting what some described as meo \u2019 s \u201c \u00e0 la carte \u201d content menu with the \u201c all - you - can - eat buffet \u201d users are accustomed to under net neutrality . \u201c portugal doesn \u2019 t have net neutrality . this is what their internet looks like ,\u201d read the headline of a typical post in this vein . <PARA> except portugal does practice net neutrality , and the graphic doesn \u2019 t accurately depict what portugal \u2019 s internet looks like overall . <PARA> the european union \u2019 s body of european regulators for electronic communications ( berec ) established net neutrality guidelines in 2015 . portugal is a member of the european union , so its internet providers must comply . <PARA> the service promoted in the meo graphic , \u201c smart net ,\u201d is essentially a menu of add - ons to the company \u2019 s standard mobile data service plan . contrary to the way it \u2019 s been presented , it doesn \u2019 t limit users \u2019 access to particular apps or sites . rather , it lays out prepackaged options via which meo customers can add extra gigabytes of data usage to their mobile phone plans ( similar to vodafone \u2019 s \u201c passes \u201d offerings ). <PARA> meo defended smart net in a <MASK> to the portuguese news web site observador ( translation by google ): <PARA> portugal \u2019 s telecommunications regulatory agency , anacom , would not speak to the smart net plan in particular but told observador that \u201c the issue of network neutrality , zero - rating offers and packages with additives are topics under analysis at anacom .\u201d <PARA> zero - rating is the practice of providing unlimited usage for specific content sources within an otherwise limited or metered data plan ( an example of this in the u . s . is t - mobile \u2019 s unlimited music and video streaming for mobile users ). <PARA> critics such as the electronic frontier foundation ( eff ), a nonprofit digital rights advocacy group , say such practices discriminate against content providers who can \u2019 t afford to compete in a \u201c pay to play \u201d environment and open the door to further preferential treatment . u . s . net neutrality rules , like those of the european union , don \u2019 t ban zero - rating outright but mandated case - by - case studies to determine if they had negative impacts on end users or open competition . <PARA> fcc chairman pai announced in february 2017 that the agency will no longer investigate instances of zero - rating , as , in his words , \u201c these free - data plans have proven to be popular among consumers , particularly low - income americans , and have enhanced competition in the wireless marketplace .\u201d <PARA> although this means mobile internet users in the united <MASK> may indeed see prepackaged data usage add - ons similar to meo \u2019 s in the future , it is not a foregone conclusion that this is what internet access as a whole will look like in the absence of net neutrality laws .",

( the <MASK> that \u201c sheep are rare in japan and most people do not know what they look like \u201d is just silly : even schoolchildren who have never seen live sheep learn to identify them from pictures and drawings and can recognize them as something distinctly different than dogs . certainly the creatures \u2019 bleating instead of barking and having hooves in place of paws are some basic , easily recognized clues .) and in this case the tale is not something that supposedly happened to the indefinite \u201c some tourist \u201d in \u201c a foreign country ,\u201d but to thousands of japanese in their homeland , people who were reportedly shelling out the equivalent of $ 1 , 600 per sheep - dog before anyone caught on to the scam and blew the whistle . <PARA> aside from its basic implausibility , a number of other details tolled the death knell for this version of the legend : <PARA> cerebral soup ! also noted it wasn \u2019 t the case that , as <MASK> in the english - language <MASK> , \u201c japanese moviestar maiko kawamaki [ sic ] went on a talk - show and wondered why her new pet would not bark or eat dog food .\u201d actually , ms . kawakami appeared on a japanese television show ( gokigenyou ) and merely said that she had heard a <MASK> about someone else \u2019 s being sold a sheep as a poodle . <PARA> all in all , this was yet another case of an urban legend \u2019 s being recycled by a few news sources who weren \u2019 t about to let the truth get in the way of a good <MASK> . <PARA> in april 2013 english - language news outlets such as the uk \u2019 s daily mail ran a similar <MASK> based on an argentinian television news report supposedly showing that scammers in argentina were selling ferrets which had been \u201c pumped up on steroids \u201d to unsuspecting buyers and passing them off as toy poodles : <PARA> one retired man from catamarca , duped by the knock - down price for a pedigree dog , became suspicious he had bought what argentinians call a \u2018 brazilian rat \u2019 and when he returned home took the \u2018 dogs \u2019 to a vet for their vaccinations . <PARA> imagine his surprise when his suspicious were confirmed \u2013 he had in fact purchased two ferrets that had been given steroids at birth to increase their size and then had some extra grooming to make their coats resemble a fluffy toy poodle . <PARA> sightings : on 28 april 2007 , venerable radio personality paul harvey broadcast as a news <MASK> the tale of japanese poodles as his for what it \u2019 s worth offering of the day , reporting , \u201c thousands of women paid many thousands of dollars for miniature white poodles which are now growing up and turning out to be furniture - eating sheep .\u201d",

popular red flag of a science headline that is \u201c according to science \u201d. <PARA> as it turns out , this <MASK> is only the most recent episode in a long <MASK> of viral science news going back , potentially , as far as 2008 . theresa fisher , in an exhaustive debunker published in on the sleep - focused website van winkle \u2019 s made it clear that the <MASK> ( as <MASK> presented ) was essentially made up . <PARA> in response to an earlier march 2016 episode of this <MASK> \u2019 s appearance , fisher found that most of the <MASK> in the <MASK> that were attributed to jim horne came from either a 2010 daily mail <MASK> , or from a different scientist altogether : \u201c[ m ] ost of horne \u2019 s <MASK> actually date back to a 2010 daily mail <MASK> . and , at least one <MASK> attributed to horne appears to belong to edward suarez at duke university .\u201d <PARA> another problem was that the pice was not an accurate representation of jim horne \u2019 s views on the topic , as he <MASK> in fisher \u2019 s debunker : \u2018\u201d i never said that women actually need more sleep , they just tend to take more sleep ,\u201d horne told van winkle \u2019 s . \u201c we have not undertaken a new study .\u201d\u2018 <PARA> digging deeper , fisher found that the <MASK> was a piecemeal stitching together of horne \u2019 s out of context <MASK> and material from a 2008 press release from duke university that had <MASK> a different scientist named edward suarez : <PARA> that duke study did find a gendered difference , not in the need for sleep , but in the harm derived from not getting enough sleep , as duke university <MASK> in a press release : <PARA> that there may be gendered differences when it comes to sleep , however , is commonly reported in the scientific literature . in the 2004 book epidemiology of sleep : age , gender , and ethnicity , kenneth lichstein and colleagues performed an extensive literature review of studies relating to sleep , finding that some <MASK> supported gender - derived differences in sleep epidemiology : <PARA> a study performed by horne himself in 1996 monitored 400 individuals over a <MORE> , but they slept for 11 min less and reported more sleep difficulties .\u201d <PARA> while horne never said women need more sleep , he has made the argument that differences in sleep between genders could be related to the amount and type of daily \u201c use \u201d men and women get out of their brain . most recently , he made that argument in his 2016 book sleeplessness : <PARA> horne \u2019 s assertion that women \u2019 s increased need for ( and trouble with ) sleep stemmed from their greater amount of daily multitasking , however , is not robustly supported by current scientific literature . though commonly touted as a scientific truth , there is a striking lack of scientific research into the <MASK> that women are better multitaskers than men . in a 2010 paper about predictors of multitasking skill , david hambrick and colleagues attempted to find any <MASK> to support the notion that women are better multitaskers and reported that they \u201c could not find a single scientific report to support this view .\u201d <PARA> since then , two studies have investigated the <MASK> experimentally . a 2013 study published in the journal psychological science experimentally investigated the existence of gendered differences in multitasking and found <MASK> to support that notion . but \u2014 by this researcher \u2019 s metric of multitasking \u2014 the difference was not so simple , and it did not indicate female superiority with multitasking : <PARA> another 2013 study , this one published in the journal bmc psychology , addressed essentially the same question and came to a different conclusion : \u201c our findings support the notion that woman [ sic ] are better than men in some types of multi - tasking ( namely when the tasks involved do not need to be carried out simultaneously ). more research on this question is urgently needed , before we can draw stronger conclusions and before we can differentiate between different explanations .\u201d <PARA> both studies , in fact , stressed the need for more research , arguing that empirical data for this commonly held belief was lacking . the authors of the latter study went so far as to argue that \u201c the near lack of empirical studies on gender differences in multitasking should caution against making strong generalisations .\u201d <PARA> as horne \u2019 s explanation for gendered differences in sleep relies on this strong generalization \u2014 that women are by necessity superior multitaskers and therefore have differing sleep needs \u2014 this aspect of his <MASK> ( and by extension the viral post \u2019 s <MASK> ) is unproven . <PARA> in addition , the argument as presented in viral news stories \u2014 that horne thinks women \u201c need \u201d more sleep because their brains work harder \u2014 is <MASK> , as those stories inaccurately reflect his views , misattribute <MASK> , cite no <MASK> , and are recycled even in the absence of any new scientific investigations .",

        "text": "<MASK> : in january 2015 a video ( published first to marketers \u2019 websites and then to youtube ) began to circulate online warning viewers about a slew of mysterious ailments caused by a \u2018 vampire fungus .\u2019 in addition to the clip \u2019 s pervasively vague <MASK> ( and comically ominous use of the theme song to zombie classic 28 days later ), the video produced confusion <PARA> among its audience because the term \u2018 vampire fungus \u2019 is also used as descriptor for pythium oligandrum , an oomycete sometimes employed in treatments for athlete \u2019 s foot and nail fungus ( because it is a parasite that \u201c feeds \u201d on the fungi that cause these conditions ). but pythium oligandrum is not the subject of the circulating video . <PARA> now that we \u2019 ve identified what the \u2018 vampire fungus \u2019 described in the video is not , pinning down what it purportedly is is another matter altogether . most folks whose curiosity was piqued by the tantalizing teaser <MASK> were forced to sit through a more than 20 - minute sales pitch about the horrifying effects of vampire fungus in order to find out what it might be . before viewers learned the name of this nightmarish infectious agent , they were instructed to check for signs of \u201c infection ,\u201d including any body fat whatsoever , any sort of skin ailment , any joint pain at all , and a laundry list of exceedingly common things one might ordinarily chalk up to being alive . <PARA> appeal to vanity was very high in the vampire fungus video , and a significant portion of it was devoted to stern warnings about how the vampire fungus \u2019 unchecked progression could lead to sugar cravings , obesity , and weight gain regardless of one \u2019 s diet or fitness regimen . additional segments of the clip focused on how garden variety skin complaints are due to the skin \u2019 s \u201c dying ,\u201d and aching joints are not the result of exertion or a known ailment but rather of joints \u201c dying .\u201d a major takeaway of the vampire fungus video was that seven out of ten americans were both getting fatter and dying , and doing so faster than before . <PARA> before the big reveal was made , the video also hinted at a nebulous conspiracy between the government , food companies , and science - based medicine to keep people in the dark about this insidious vampire fungus . predictably , the video \u2019 s makers ( who embedded it in a format that disabled the ability of viewers to skip to the end without sitting through the entire pitch ) peddled a cure for vampire fungus the government and big companies are supposedly trying their best to suppress . <PARA> so what is vampire fungus ? according to the drawn out conclusion of the video , \u201c a candida \u201d ( or yeast ). you may recognize candida as the culprit behind candidiasis , more commonly termed a \u201c yeast infection \u201d or thrush . while inconvenient , temporary overgrowth of candida is easily diagnosable and treatable with antifungal medications or ointments . <PARA> in rare cases , invasive candidiasis can lead to more serious systemic infection in people with compromised immune systems . the centers for disease control ( cdc ) explains : <PARA> invasive candidiasis is a fungal infection that can occur when candida yeasts enter the bloodstream . once the fungus is in the bloodstream , it can spread to other parts of the body and cause infection . <PARA> invasive candidiasis is extremely rare in people without risk factors , but it is the fourth most common cause of hospital - acquired bloodstream infections in the u . s . in the general population , the incidence is 8 to 10 cases per 100 , 000 people . <PARA> invasive candidiasis is extremely rare in people without risk factors , but it is the fourth most common cause of hospital - acquired bloodstream infections in the u . s . in the general population , the incidence is 8 to 10 cases per 100 , 000 people . <PARA> invasive candidiasis is generally treated via intravenous administration of antifungal medications for several weeks . <PARA> the vampire fungus threat , however , is simply candida . overgrowth of the fungus can lead to a yeast infection ( which is rarely serious ), but it isn \u2019 t slowly killing 70 % of americans . candida has intermittently been blamed for a number of ailments ( including obesity ), but no real <MASK> suggests its typical effects amount to much more than what is commonly called a yeast infection .",

        "text": "for several years , alerts circulated online have warned about the purported dangers of cutting an onion and then cooking with that sliced vegetable the following day : <PARA> the earliest example of such a warning we \u2019 ve encountered came in that form of a missive that began circulating in march 2008 . <PARA> it was penned by sarah mccann , who writes online about food - related matters , including recipes , warning about the purported dangers of spoiled onions . ( the pen name \u201c zola gorgon \u201d is a play on gorgonzola , a veined blue italian cheese known for its strong flavor and distinctive odor .) <PARA> mike mullins of mullins food products had this to say about the tour of his company \u2019 s facilities that resulted in the internet <MASK> about food poisonings from onions and mayonnaise : <PARA> as to the content of the <MASK> , it is <MASK> that commercially - prepared mayonnaise is hardly the food poisoning menace it is widely believed to be . a study conducted by researchers at the university of wisconsin \u2019 s food research institute in late 1980 and early 1981 ( results published in the journal of food protection in february 1982 ) showed that mayonnaise actually inhibited the growth of some bacteria in food . its high acid content , gained from the incorporation of ingredients like vinegar or lemon juice into the product , slows bacterial growth . \u201c when you add the mayonnaise to your salad , you decrease the ph of that salad . it makes it more of a hostile environment for that bacteria ,\u201d said michael p . doyle , an assistant professor of agriculture and life sciences at the university . salt in the condiment also works to prevent spoilage . <PARA> however , mayonnaise is still not a substitute for keeping food cold . also , homemade mayo , which is made from raw eggs , poses the threat of salmonella poisoning . ( the eggs used in commercially - prepared mayonnaise have been pasteurized .) <PARA> the <MASK> made in the <MASK> about onions ( and to a lesser extent , potatoes ) are harder to substantiate . germ transmission does occur more quickly when surfaces nasty microbes are lurking on or items that become contaminated by them are wet rather than dry ; but it \u2019 s a great leap from realizing that cut surfaces of onions and potatoes are wet to concluding either of these vegetables are \u201c a huge magnet for bacteria .\u201d <PARA> also , cut bulb onions are highly acidic ; the act of slicing them causes the enzymes they contain to generate sulphenic acids , the gas form of which has made many an unwary onion chopper cry . given that it is mayonnaise \u2019 s acidity that retards the growth of bacteria , it \u2019 s hard to conclude that cut onions would be a hospitable place for germs or bacteria to take up residence , let alone a magnet that drew them from the air . <PARA> however , long - standing superstition posits that very thing . it has long been asserted that keeping a plate of cut raw onions in the house will draw illness - causing germs from the air , thereby rendering the home free of contamination . these print sightings gathered by folklorists iona opie and moira tatum showcase that belief : <PARA> mind you , superstition also asserts that it is unlucky to keep cut onions around , as these additional sightings gathered by opie and tatum demonstrate : <PARA> are cut bulb onions therefore a health scourge one must be on guard against ? no scientific <MASK> points in that direction . what reports there are that tie onions to outbreaks of food poisoning almost exclusively name green onions ( also known as long onions or scallions ) as the culprit . although both sorts could be exposed to e . coli and other nasties during their time in the ground or while being handled during the move to market , green onions are chopped up and eaten as is , whereas the paperish brown peel that covers bulb onions and which is discarded rather than ingested acts as a shield against contamination . <PARA> the one instance we found that fingered bulb onions as the transmitter in a food poisoning case was the 1984 sickening of 28 people in peoria , illinois . botulism was passed to those unfortunate souls by the sauteed onions used on a restaurant \u2019 s \u201c patty melt \u201d ( a cheeseburger on rye with sauteed onions ).",

        "text": "in early february 2017 , various web sites began posting stories regarding a piece of legislation recently passed in the <MASK> of arkansas . those stories were typically published under misleading headlines such as \u201c new arkansas law allows rapists to sue victims seeking abortion \u201d and \u201c arkansas passes law allowing rapists to prevent victims who want an abortion \u201d: <PARA> the law in question , titled the arkansas unborn child protection from dismemberment abortion act , essentially bans what lawmakers term \u201c dismemberment abortions \u201d ( which the medical community refers to as \u201c dilation and evacuation ,\u201d or d & e ) by making the provision of such a procedure a felony crime . although the law precludes family members or rapists from suing pregnant women , it does grant spouses , parents , or legal guardians the ability to sue physicians who perform the procedure for damages and obtain injunctions preventing those physicians from performing additional such procedures . <PARA> jr davis , spokesman for arkansas governor asa hutchinson , pointed to a section of the law that prevents damages from being awarded when a terminated pregnancy was the result of a criminal act : \u201c civil damages shall not be awarded to a plaintiff if the pregnancy resulted from the criminal conduct of the plaintiff .\u201d thus , a rapist cannot sue his victim and reap any benefits from doing so . furthermore , the law excludes a woman \u201c who receives or attempts to receive a dismemberment abortion \u201d from civil liability . <PARA> davis also pointed out that the language in the law doesn \u2019 t enable a woman \u2019 s relatives to halt an abortion ; rather , it allows them to seek an injunction that prevents \u201c the abortion provider from performing or attempting to perform further dismemberment abortions ...\u201d the law , davis said , was geared toward prosecuting physicians who perform the procedure rather than targeting pregnant women . <PARA> the thrust of the law is that it makes it a felony for doctors to perform dilation and evacuation abortion procedures , except in cases where such a procedure is necessary to prevent death or physical maiming of the mother . critics note that the law doesn \u2019 t allow an exception for patients to obtain the specified procedure even in cases of rape or incest . according to davis , the law is \u201c not a prohibition on abortion in the second trimester ,\u201d but rather a restriction on a specific abortion method . <PARA> the aclu , which plans to challenge the law in court , called it \u201c blatantly unconstitutional \u201d because it bans the most common \u2014 and advocates say the safest \u2014 method of abortion in the second trimester of pregnancy . <PARA> bettina brownstein , aclu arkansas co - counsel on the matter , noted in a <MASK> that : <PARA> according to the associated press , the new arkansas law is similar to legislative actions taken by west virginia and mississippi , while related bans in alabama , kansas , louisiana , and oklahoma are on hold due to ongoing legal challenges . <PARA> the bill passed the republican - led arkansas <MASK> senate on 26 january 2017 with a 25 - 6 vote divided largely along party lines , and it was signed by governor hutchinson the next day . the law was slated to go into effect later in 2017 , but a federal judge judge blocked its implementation via preliminary injunction at the end of july .",

ready gmo crop seeds ) with rising rates of autism . children with autism have biomarkers indicative of excessive glyphosate , including zinc and iron deficiency , low serum sulfate , seizures , and mitochondrial disorder . <PARA> the <MASK> conflated a number of unrelated <MASK> and beliefs about autism and its causes , jumping from pesticides to vaccines and back again in the course of its travels . a usda report issued in december 2014 about acceptable levels of pesticides ( that made no mention at all of autism ) was among the cited material : <PARA> in addition , as we have previously reported , the number of adverse reactions from vaccines can be correlated as well with autism , though seneff says it doesn \u2019 t correlate quite as closely as with roundup . the same correlations between applications of glyphosate and autism show up in deaths from senility . <PARA> of course , autism is a complex problem with many potential causes . dr . seneff \u2019 <MORE> foundations . <PARA> regarding autism rates in 2025 , the \u201c 50 percent of children \u201d estimate looks to be a rudimentary extrapolation of an apparent uptick in autism diagnoses in recent years . particularly if the cause of such an uptick is improvements in screening and access to diagnostics , it \u2019 s just as likely the rate would plateau or even dip in the near future when considered by itself . no explanation was proffered ( in the <MASK> , at least ) to justify an affirmative belief the prevalence of autism would rise so drastically ( and by that logic we might assume that by 2050 , 125 percent of the population will be diagnosed with autism ). <PARA> even disregarding the sloppy mathematics , the <MASK> \u2019 s very basis ( that glyphosate is the cause of a perceived increase in autism ) is unsupported . no mention was made of how glyphosate was isolated and shown to be a cause ( or even a factor ) in some or any cases of autism in the <MASK> . no autism spikes near agricultural facilities were described , nor was any definitive causative link at all cited by the <MASK> ( and presumably , seneff ) to back up the purported link between glyphosate and autism rates anywhere other than the imaginations of those making the <MASK> . the single link of merit made within the <MASK> ( to a usda report ) made absolutely no mention of autism at all but was misleadingly arranged to suggest a connection . <PARA> what the <MASK> seemed to hinge on largely was a correlation / causation fallacy : because [ unclear activity involving glyphosate ] occurred , a corresponding rise in autism diagnoses must be due to that unspecified issue with glyphosate . <MASK> of a similar nature have been dispelled with graphs like the following that show how difficult ( or simple ) it is to \u201c prove \u201d any one cause correlates with any one effect : <PARA> clearly the graph is tongue - in - cheek , but the sentiment is clear . without peer - reviewed reproducible research , any number of factors can be blamed for what looks like a rise in autism rates . in actuality , scientists in a number of relevant fields have been working full - time to find real and provable answers to that question . <PARA> whether educated or not , guesswork is only the start of research in epidemiology , and no published research exists to prove ( or even suggest ) a link between glyphosate and autism . no <MASK> was presented in the <MASK> to provide context for why glyphosate ( or gmos ) would be any more likely to account for the presumed increase than other environmental factors , and it appeared the only visible connection between the two was their inclusion on a graph presented at a conference of an indeterminate nature .",

( at first , botts favored attaching the dots to the roadway with steel spikes but soon realized a spike that shed its dot would become a hazard lying in wait of a plump unsuspecting tire .) <PARA> the glue was perfected in the early 1960s , but the first botts \u2019 dots weren \u2019 t installed until 1966 on <MASK> 80 around fairfield and on highway 99 near fresno . elbert botts did not live to see his brainchild make his name a household word \u2014 he died in 1962 long before any fame was associated with him . <PARA> a persistent bit of lore attaches to botts , that he sold his idea to caltrans and became a wealthy man by wisely insisting on payment of a small royalty per dot installed . that is <MASK> : botts was the head of the caltrans department charged with devising solutions to the marking of freeway lanes problem . this was no lone inventor slaving away in a basement laboratory who devised a killer app , sold it to a company in desperate need of it , and suddenly found himself living in the lap of luxury as the royalty checks kept rolling in . rather , this was a man who worked a 9 - to - 5 job at caltrans battling all manner of problems associated with pavement and lane markings . <PARA> botts \u2019 dots come in two types , round and square , and in several colors . most are white , center markers are amber , wrong - way markers are red , and fire hydrant markers are blue . on most multi - lane freeways , caltrans uses four white round non - reflective dots in a row , interspersed every 48 feet with a reflective square , along the painted stripes dividing lanes . <PARA> in 1997 , there were some 25 million botts \u2019 dots in california . they can last more than ten years on some stretches of roadway but in others have to be replaced after only a few months \u2019 wear . <PARA> botts \u2019 dots provide an additional benefit unforeseen by its inventor \u2014 driving over them produces a ka - thump ! ka - thump ! ka - thump ! sound that swiftly captures the attention of motorists drifting out of their lanes or off the highway . because of this , they are installed on the outer edges of roadways known for their incidence of highway hypnosis as well as on the lines dividing one lane from another . many a sleepy or distracted motorist has been saved from disaster by the alerting ka - thumps ! of a sequence of botts \u2019 dots under their wheels . <PARA> barbara \u201c dot common \u201d mikkelson",

        "text": "last week , the home owners had a pool service come in to drain and clean the pool . they found the body at the bottom of the pool with the pillow case filled with their valuables . just goes to show you , there is some justice out there . <PARA> or , as my mother would say ... <PARA> \u2018 be sure your sins will find you out .\u2019 <PARA> <MASK> : one <PARA> popular genre of urban legendry is the \u201c just deserts \u201d tale , in which the criminal who preys on citizens and their <PARA> property is caught and punished \u2014 not just through ordinary police work , but because he is tripped up by his own greed , arrogance , or foolishness . after natural disasters that result in widespread loss of life and property , however , this type of legend takes a darker turn , and the punishment meted out to the lawbreaker correspondingly increases from capture to death . the last few major earthquakes in california , for example , have spurred versions of this type in which a car thief meets his maker when a section of freeway collapses atop him as he attempts to make off with a purloined vehicle . <PARA> the example cited above , coming in the wake of august 2005 \u2019 s hurricane katrina , presents all the same elements of those earlier earthquake tales : a natural disaster , a thief who helps himself to someone else \u2019 s valuables , a criminal done in by the dynamic duo of mother nature and greed , and a corpse not found until well after the fatal event . in this case , just like the fable of the man ( or monkey ) who cannot extricate his hand from a jar until he lets go of the desired goods contained therein , the looter \u2019 s plunder weighs him down and traps him at the <PARA> bottom of a flood - submerged pool \u2014 only this time there is no easy escape , and the thief perishes by drowning . ( the reference to <PARA> \u201c brothers \u201d also suggests the looter was black and thereby introduces an element of race found in other katrina - related <PARA> legends .) <PARA> unless some key element is missing from this account ( such as the looter \u2019 s pillowcase full of booty was tied securely to him or stuffed into a backpack strapped around his body ), this scenario doesn \u2019 t sound plausible as a real - life event , as the thief could simply have let go the sack of valuables and floated free . we also note that this scenario is so timeworn that it was mentioned in a 1945 collection of \u201c tired and tiresome plots which constantly turn up on editors \u2019 desks \u201d: <PARA> ( 30 ) a man on the verge of starvation with some companions in a desert shoots his friends and takes what little food remains . all is well for a time . unfortunately , in attempting to find his way to a settlement he becomes lost . for days he fights for his life . he plunges through the hot sand without losing hope . on the twentieth day , near sundown , he sees signs of human beings . he gropes his way toward them and finds \u2014 that he is back where he started . <PARA> ( 31 ) the same <MASK> as the one just outlined , except that the killer is so loaded with gold that when he flops accidentally into a pool of water or a wild river he cannot swim . the gold pulls him down , and he drowns . <PARA> ( 31 ) the same <MASK> as the one just outlined , except that the killer is so loaded with gold that when he flops accidentally into a pool of water or a wild river he cannot swim . the gold pulls him down , and he drowns . <PARA> ( the same basic plot shows up in literature well before the 20th century , as a similar fate also befalls dunstan cass , a character in george eliot \u2019 s 1861 novel silas marner , who steals marner \u2019 s gold but then falls into an abandoned quarry and drowns , with his body remaining undiscovered until years later .) <PARA> but of course , what \u2019 s important here ( in a folkloric sense ) is not the anecdote \u2019 s truthfulness , but the moral it expresses : had the crook not taken advantage of others \u2019 misfortune and made off with their property , he wouldn \u2019 t have lost his life . no one relishes the thought of being victimized in a crime , and compounding that distaste is the knowledge that all too often the perpetrators get away with their misdeeds . but in these legends , at least , the wrong - doers are brought to justice by their criminal actions .",

        "text": "for nearly twenty years now , internet users have been immersed in warnings advising them to be wary of persons attempting to sell perfume in store parking lots : <PARA> the scenario described above isn \u2019 t a real danger . no one has reported having been robbed in this manner , save for one woman in 1999 whose <MASK> was suspect ( for reasons we discuss below ). this legend doesn \u2019 t even describe a plausible scenario because , despite what books and television shows may depict , rendering a person unconscious from a mere sniff or two of some substance is not easy to do . ether is nasty , volatile stuff that requires a great deal more than a few brief inhalations to knock a person out . in fact , it \u2019 s hard to think of any substance that could produce the instant unconsciousness described here . <PARA> this legend appears to have begun in late 1999 with a widely - circulated internet message that used one specific news report as a basis for implying that ether - wielding robbers were a potentially widespread menace : <PARA> the incident described above was \u201c real \u201d in the sense that a mobile , alabama , woman <MASK> it happened to her on 8 november 1999 and reported the alleged robbery to the police , but it \u2019 s <MASK> in that no <MASK> ever surfaced to verify her <MASK> . <PARA> bertha johnson , a 54 - year - old mobile woman , maintained that at about 2 : 00 pm on monday , 8 november , she had pulled into the parking lot of a bank when a woman approached her car and offered to sell her bottles of cologne that ordinarily retail for $ 45 for the low price of $ 8 . ms . johnson says she sniffed a sample of the cologne , and the next thing she knew it was around half an hour later , she was standing with her keys in her hand at a wicker store two miles away from the bank , her head was throbbing , and $ 800 she had been carrying ($ 500 of her own money plus $ 300 of her employer \u2019 s ) was missing . however , her <MASK> had some surface implausibilities : <PARA> sure enough , several weeks later the toxicology reports concerning tests run on blood and urine samples taken from ms . johnson immediately after the alleged attack did not indicate the presence of any unusual or abnormal substance in her system . the case remained officially open , but this one smelled like a scam cooked up by ms . johnson to abscond with her employer \u2019 s money . <PARA> now , in <MASK> urban legend fashion , this tale has gone from a news report of an alleged victim \u2019 s unsubstantiated <MASK> to a general warning that this sort of thing <MORE> ? that no \u201c knockout potions \u201d were offered to them and no robberies ( completed or attempted ) took place does little to dissuade them from their certainty that they came within a hair \u2019 s breadth of harm at the hands of some innocent freelance perfume sellers . <PARA> we wrote the <MASK> <MASK> about this <MASK> in 2000 . as far along as april 2006 , alabama police were still having to field reports on this non - existent form of crime and inform the public that it \u2019 s a hoax : <PARA> since 2000 ( when we wrote our <MASK> <MASK> ), we \u2019 ve been keeping our ears and eyes open for news of any instances of this sort of robbery happening in real life . so far , the closest thing to arise is a july 2008 case in a town in louisiana . <PARA> in houma , louisiana , a woman named patches wegmann was arrested after two men she plied with cologne <MASK> to have suffered ill effects from what she \u2019 d had them breathe in . the first said she accosted him , sprayed a cologne sample on a piece of paper , and waved it under his nose . subsequently , after he returned to work , he passed out , his symptoms including dizziness , shortness of breath , and numbness in his extremities . the second said the cologne \u2019 s fumes left him feeling light - headed , and it irritated his skin . <PARA> wegmann was charged with second - degree battery and unlawful solicitation , but the battery charge has to do with forcing perfume samples upon unwilling parties , not because there was anything necessarily noxious in the substance she forced upon them . the incident remains under investigation , and authorities say it \u2019 s not clear that anything other than perfume was sprayed on either man . <PARA> in 2001 a <MASK> internet <MASK> about seven women having died after sniffing perfume samples sent to them in the mail spread in the wake of the september 11 attacks . this newer <MASK> was a combination of two older and equally baseless scares : the 1999 \u201c perfume robbers \u201d tale ( which is the topic of the <MASK> above ) and the 2000 klingerman virus warning about blue virus - laden sponges mailed in envelopes marked \u201c a gift for you from the klingerman foundation \u201d which supposedly caused 23 deaths . the 2001 \u201c deadly perfume samples \u201d <MASK> brought into play the specter of lurking terrorists using the u . s . mail system to murder the innocent in a women - targeted replay of the anthrax mailings horror . the \u201c deadly perfume samples \u201d <MASK> is distinct and indeed far removed from the \u201c perfume robbers \u201d one , yet folks are prone to confuse the two because they both use the word \u2018 perfume .\u2019",

        "text": "in the summer of 2018 , many americans were alarmed to read about the phenomenon of young immigrant children , without free legal aid , having to plead their cases before a judge in deportation and asylum cases . for example , in a 27 june <MASK> , the texas tribune reported that : <PARA> this report prompted inquiries from multiple skeptical and concerned readers asking us if it was <MASK> . <PARA> the referenced practice does occur today and has taken place for years . we spoke with immigration attorneys who confirmed that immigrant children subject to deportation or asylum hearings are not entitled to court - appointed lawyers , and they recalled having represented clients as young as two and three years old . <PARA> background <PARA> in the united <MASK> , any defendant in a criminal case is constitutionally entitled to be represented by a court - appointed attorney at no cost if they cannot afford to hire their own . however , this constitutional guarantee does not extend to civil cases or immigration courts ( although in some <MASK> and some circumstances , <MASK> law does entitle individuals to free legal aid in civil cases ). <PARA> instead , those who find themselves before immigration courts , whether adults or children , have the right , if not always the wherewithal , to obtain legal representation from one of a number of non - profit organizations and law firms who work on a pro bono basis . <PARA> although defendants do not have a right to court - appointed free legal aid in immigration court , the federal government does indirectly contribute to their assistance . the office for refugee resettlement , which is part of the department of health and human services , contracts with the non - profit vera institute for justice , which in turn sub - contracts with more than a dozen organizations around the country to provide free legal representation and advice to immigrants facing deportation and other legal issues . <PARA> in april 2018 , during the same week that u . s . attorney general jeff sessions implemented the \u201c zero tolerance \u201d immigration policy , the executive office for immigration review \u2014 which oversees the u . s . immigration court system \u2014 reportedly informed the vera institute that these legal assistance programs were to be put on hold pending a cost - effectiveness review . <PARA> sessions later announced that the programs would not be paused , but a review of their costs would still be taking place . <PARA> numbers <PARA> according to <MASK> collected by syracuse university , 58 , 015 unaccompanied children ( i . e ., juveniles under the age of 18 separated from their legal adult guardians ) were subjected to deportation hearings in american immigration courts in 2017 . <PARA> that figure was 61 , 254 in 2016 , and 35 , 113 in 2015 . between 2005 and 2017 , <MORE> for the children argued that : <PARA> the 9th circuit court of appeals rejected the lawsuit in 2016 on a question of jurisdiction and rejected a similar high - profile lawsuit in january 2018 , leaving in place the <MASK> quo : thousands of children with no right to court - appointed attorneys in immigration court . <PARA> megan mckenna is communications director at kids in need of defense , a charity devoted specifically to advancing and upholding the rights of children in immigration policy . she told us that the youngest child the organization had formally represented in immigration court was just two years old . <PARA> no rules or guidelines currently in place establish a minimum age below which children can \u2019 t be forced to defend themselves in court , according to mckenna . the court does provide a translator , if necessary , but most protections and services for children are at the discretion of judges who can , for example , delay a hearing to give a child time to find legal representation but are not obliged to do so . <PARA> mckenna described the process as \u201c unforgiving ,\u201d adding that \u201c they \u2019 re all coming for a very difficult reason . no child would come on their own , hundreds or thousands of miles , unless something was really wrong .\u201d <PARA> the debate over whether children ( as opposed to adults ) should be entitled to taxpayer - funded free legal aid in immigration cases partially revolves around the question of whether children , as a category , are less capable than adults of both understanding their circumstances and the questions put to them by a judge , performing the logical processes required to put together an argument on their own behalf , and verbalizing that argument with sufficient clarity and impact . <PARA> in 2016 , jack weil , a u . s . justice department official responsible for training immigration judges , sparked controversy with remarks he made during a deposition in the f . l . b . v lynch class action case . weil suggested that three - and four - year - old children could be \u201c taught immigration law ,\u201d although he later maintained that his comments had been taken out of context . <PARA> during weil \u2019 s deposition , aclu attorney ahilan arulanantham questioned him as follows ( page 69 ): <PARA> we posed a series of questions to the u . s . department of justice relating to the presence of children in immigration courts , including whether any rules prevented children with intellectual disabilities from being ordered to defend themselves , what the specific criteria are for a judge to determine whether a child is capable of functioning in court , as well as the number unaccompanied children who have been subject to immigration court proceedings so far in 2018 , but did not receive a response by press time .",

        "text": "<MASK> : in 1990 , a clerk for a steinberg grocery store in eastern ontario discovered something in a pepsi bottle he at first mistook for a straw . a closer examination revealed the item to be a syringe , and the bottle was rescued from the shelf before it fell into the <PARA> hands of a consumer . the find was turned over to store management , who in turn brought it to the attention of health and welfare canada . health and welfare canada launched an investigation into the incident , and although they ultimately achieved no official resolution of the case , they reasoned the likely culprit was a disgruntled employee of the bottler , eastcan beverages of ottawa , ontario . the incident was not repeated ; no more syringes turned up in any other bottles . <PARA> in an eerie way , that 1990 find was the precursor to the 1993 pepsi syringe panic . once again , hypodermic needles and this particular brand of cola met up , but this time the confluence of the two was pyrotechnic . <PARA> in the space of two days in june 1993 , news stories about finds of syringe - laden cans of pepsi swept the usa . for a short time it looked like a widespread instance of product tampering was underway . the first report came on 9 june 1993 from an 82 - year - old man in tacoma , washington , who said he looked into a can of diet pepsi to see if he had won a prize and found a syringe . ( he had not noticed the hypodermic when he poured himself a drink from the can ; he found the needle the next day .) soon afterwards , similar reports flooded in from all over the usa . at least 52 reports of tampering in at least 23 <MASK> were ultimately made before this scare ran its course . <PARA> though most of the \u201c finds \u201d involved syringes ( a woman in portland , oregon , said she found two in a single glass ), the list of items allegedly recovered from pepsi , diet pepsi , and caffeine free diet pepsi cans included a wood screw , a bullet , a crack vial , a broken sewing needle , and a mysterious blob of brown goo . <PARA> pepsi and the food and drug administration soon ruled out product tampering as the cause of these \u201c finds .\u201d it quickly became obvious the beverager was the victim of a spontaneous hoax . once the first find was publicized , a number of unscrupulous people who sought to cash in on it created a rolling wave of growing hysteria , as each news <MASK> prompted another phony \u201c find \u201d which in turn prompted another news <MASK> . those looking for a quick buck reasoned it would be terribly easy to coax a little money out of pepsi <MORE> . yet was it enough ? needle - find hysteria in 1993 was nothing compared to what it would be now , when every found hypodermic is presumed to be laden with the aids virus , but even so pepsi will long be remembered as the soft drink with a syringe . the bell of <MASK> could not be unrung , even had the media cooperated . <PARA> unfortunately , the media didn \u2019 t cooperate . as gail de vos points out in her 1996 tales , <MASK> , and gossip , accounts of obvious post - purchase can tampering never came close to achieving the same level of prominence in the press as accounts of the <MASK> horrifying find did . as an example , she cites coverage by the edmonton journal , which was typical of how many news outlets handled resolution of this news <MASK> : \u201c the first two <MASK> appeared in the front section of the paper but the final outcome was not considered of equal importance \u2014 hence its appearance in the e section !\u201d <PARA> while the slogan \u201c if it bleeds , it leads \u201d holds just as <MASK> here as with any other news topic , one might just as rightly coin \u201c once it \u2019 s nary \u2019 d , it gets buried .\u201d tidy , fact - filled resolution <MASK> that explain away previous misreporting just aren \u2019 t nearly as interesting to the public as headlines which scream \u201c beware of this lurking danger : it could happen to you !\u201d the press know that , so <MASK> of such ilk get tossed deep into the paper where most folks won \u2019 t encounter them . <PARA> this escalates the problem of an increasingly hysterical public : uneven coverage leads folks to believe their world is fraught with lurking dangers . why should they not believe just that when the front page is filled day after day with one horrific <MASK> after another , yet the calm , rational stuff is habitually buried in the e section ? <PARA> the \u201c syringe in the pepsi can \u201d tale is a fine case in point of the results of this form of weighted reporting . <PARA> although most folks who were media - aware in 1993 remember news stories about needles found in soft drink cans , not all that many of them could now ( or even back then ) tell you the whole thing turned out to be a hoax , an attempt on the part of a number of miscreants to rifle the deep pockets of a large corporation . to the majority , the <MASK> will always remain \u201c bad guys hid needles in pepsi cans , and i could have gotten hurt ,\u201d not \u201c scam artists tried to shake down pepsi by pretending to find tampered cans .\u201d <PARA> barbara \u201c all that \u2019 s now remembered is the fizz \u201d mikkelson",

        "text": "<MASK> : it \u2019 s an immutable fact of television life that local <MASK> and cable networks typically run more commercials during the airing of syndicated series than broadcast networks airing first - run episodes of current series do , which requires the former to find ways to fit 30 - or 60 - minutes episodes into a shorter amount of air time . as well , the amount of air time given over to commercials ( by both networks and cable channels ) has grown in recent years , making it even more difficult to squeeze full episodes of syndicated series around commercial breaks : <PARA> the rise in commercials can be attributed to two factors : broadcast and cable networks are allotting more time for commercials , and advertisers are increasingly using shorter spots to hawk their products . <PARA> in 2009 , the broadcast networks averaged 13 minutes and 25 seconds of commercial time per hour . in 2013 , that figure grew to 14 minutes and 15 seconds . <PARA> this issue has usually been dealt with by judiciously cutting scenes from episodes when they air in syndication \u2014 sometimes to the dismay of fans who have purchased dvds of their favorite series , only to find those discs used the truncated syndicated versions of episodes rather than the <MASK> broadcast versions . <PARA> but there \u2019 s another way for <MASK> to fit the same amount of televised material into a shorter time slot , one which has left many viewers puzzled and annoyed . it was demonstrated in a video posted to the avs forum on 13 september 2013 , that the tbs cable network was airing sped - up ( or \u201c time compressed \u201d) versions of the popular half - hour sitcom seinfeld in order to fit more commercials into its time slot : <PARA> i lined up the windows as closely as possible so you can also see cropping . between that and the extreme speed increase , tbs is butchering a classic . <PARA> tech times has also noted that the change is especially noticeable in shows from the seinfeld era , which <MASK> aired with an average run time of around 25 minutes , while modern sitcoms such as the big bang theory have run times as short as 19 minutes : <PARA> back when seinfeld was <MASK> airing , the average run - time for a sitcom was 25 minutes . that was just how things were done : five minutes for commercials , 25 minutes for actual show . now , things are different ; shows run at around 21 or 22 minutes , with roughly eight minutes for ads . when it came time to run old seinfeld episodes , tbs was faced with a conundrum : how do you get extra ad time out of a show that aired 15 years ago ? <PARA> tbs \u2019 apparent answer was , in this case , to speed the entire episode up . that way , none of the show \u2019 s content would be cut , and the network would still get its ad time . <PARA> tbs has not confirmed that it has time compressed episodes of seinfeld in order to fit in more commercials , but the network does display an \u201c edited for time \u201d warning before some programs : <PARA> it should also be noted that while tbs may have sped up some episodes of seinfeld , it does not appear that the network does this for every syndicated series . some episodes may air as <MASK> intended , while others may have scenes added or deleted in order to fit time constraints .",

        "text": "a compilation health piece about the health - related differences between butter and margarine began circulating on the internet in june 2003 , often under the title \u201c butter vs . margarine \u201d: <PARA> eventually , the primary focus of the \u201c butter vs . margarine \u201d piece became the following preface that was later tacked onto it : <PARA> contrary to the <MASK> , margarine was not invented as a turkey fattener . it was formulated in 1869 by hippolyte m\u00e8ge mouri\u00e8s of france in response to napoleon iii \u2019 s offering of a prize to whoever could succeed at producing a viable low - cost substitute for butter . m\u00e8ge mouri\u00e8s \u2019 concoction , which he dubbed oleomargarine , was achieved by adding salty water , milk , and margaric acid to softened beef fat . by the turn of the century , the beef fat in the <MASK> recipe had been replaced by vegetable oils . <PARA> nonetheless , there was a fair bit of truth to the health issues the piece surveyed , at least at the time it was first circulated . according to the latest findings in the medical world in 2003 , margarine could increase the risk of heart disease , depending upon the type of fat contained in the spread . previously , the dietary villain in the development of coronary disease was presumed to be saturated fat , but newer <MASK> pointed the finger at trans fat ( also known as trans fatty acids ). although butter has its own set of dietary shortcomings , it does not contain trans fat . <PARA> in 1994 , harvard university researchers reported that people who ate partially hydrogenated oils , which are high in trans fats , had nearly twice the risk of heart attacks as those who consumed much less of the substance . several large studies in the united <MASK> and elsewhere , including the nurses \u2019 health study conducted by researchers at the harvard school of public health , have also suggested a strong link between earlier death and consumption of foods high in trans fat . <PARA> trans fats occur naturally in small amounts in some foods , including meat and dairy products , but most trans fats in the american diet are formed when vegetable oils are chemically changed to give them a longer shelf life . cookies , potato chips , baked products , and the like are particularly loaded with trans fats . <PARA> the food and drug administration , the national academy , the national heart , lung , and blood institute , and the american heart association all recommend consumers limit their intake of trans fat wherever possible . moreover , the federal government passed regulations requiring that by 2006 all food labels disclose how much trans fat a product contains . <PARA> back in 2003 we compiled the following comparison chart for various brands of margarine as they were then formulated . numbers given in grams refer to how many grams of each particular type of fat there are per tablespoon of that brand . ( a tablespoon of butter or margarine contains 14 grams .) numbers given as percentages represent the impact of one tablespoon of that spread on the recommended daily allowance of that substance . margarines sampled were of the \u201c tub \u201d variety . ( the same margarines in \u201c stick \u201d form had consistently higher numbers .) <PARA> because butter is an animal product , it contains cholesterol , amounting to 30 mg per tablespoon or 10 % of the usda recommended daily allowance . margarines , because they are non - animal products , do not . the preceding chart says nothing about which margarines contained trans fats ( or , if they did , how much ) because this information was not always included on product labels back then . <PARA> since the issuance of warnings and regulations about trans fats in the last few years , many margarine producers have reformulated their products . i can \u2019 t believe it \u2019 s not butter , for example , now ( in 2006 ) bears a notice on its label <MASK> \u201c no trans fat ,\u201d and the amount of polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fat per serving has dropped from 4 . 5g each to 4g ( polyunsaturated ) and 2g ( monounsaturated ) per serving . <PARA> although a great deal of the information given in the piece is valid , one bit of intelligence is nothing more than hyperbole tossed in by the author in an effort to make his point more strongly . the <MASK> that some comestible is but a \u201c single molecule away \u201d from being a decidedly inedible ( or even toxic ) substance has been applied to a variety of processed foods : <PARA> these types of <MASK> ( even if they were <MASK> ) are essentially meaningless . many disparate substances share similar chemical properties , but even the slightest variation in molecular structure can make a world of difference in the qualities of those substances . ( one would hardly argue that hydrogen peroxide is perfectly drinkable because the only difference between it and water is one oxygen atom .) <PARA> in 1886 , new york and new jersey prohibited the manufacture and sale of yellow - colored margarine , and by 1902 , 32 u . s . <MASK> had enacted such prohibitions against the coloration of the spread . ( folks got around this by mixing yellow food coloring into the white margarine .) in 1950 president truman repealed the requirement that margarine be offered for sale only in uncolored <MASK> , which led to the widespread production of the yellow margarine that has come to be the norm .",

        "text": "in september 2017 , facebook users spread several <MASK> about government benefits and assistance available to florida residents in the aftermath of hurricane irma . one of these <MASK> involved the provision of food stamps for floridians whose homes had experienced power outages of at least two hours in duration . <PARA> a typical expression of the <MASK> read as follows : <PARA> a similar <MASK> <MASK> that the federal emergency management agency ( fema ), rather than the <MASK> of florida , was overseeing food stamp benefits : <PARA> a separate but related <MASK> held that fema was directly providing floridians with $ 500 for food purchases : <PARA> none of these <MASK> was quite right , and they all seemed to be based on misunderstandings of a federal disaster relief program known as disaster - snap ( or d - snap ), which was extended to parts of florida on 22 september 2017 . <PARA> d - snap is a program that temporarily extends the benefits usually available under snap ( supplemental nutrition assistance program , commonly known as food stamps ) to individuals affected by natural disasters . one does not have to be an existing recipient of snap benefits in order to qualify for d - snap , but the latter program does incorporate maximum income limits . d - snap assistance typically lasts for one month , but agriculture secretary sonny perdue announced on 22 september that the program would be in place for two months in florida . <PARA> recipients are provided with a temporary ebt card containing an amount of credit based upon household size and income . <PARA> a one - person household with a gross monthly income of $ 1 , 664 or less would receive $ 194 in d - snap credit for one month ( a figure that may be the source of the \u201c$ 197 per person \u201d <MASK> in some facebook <MASK> ). an eight - person household ( provided it has a gross monthly income of $ 4 , 151 or less ) would be eligible to receive $ 1 , 169 in d - snap assistance ( an average of $ 146 per person ). a two - person household ( provided it met the income requirements ) would be eligible for $ 357 in benefits , or $ 179 . 50 per person . ( there is no set benefit amount per person , a common element of the <MASK> which is misleading .) <PARA> the extension of d - snap in florida applies to certain counties . a county is considered eligible based upon the percentage of power outages experienced over a period of 72 hours , as well as the level of structural and flood damage suffered . <PARA> so power outages do play a role in the provision of extended snap benefits , but only on the county level . such benefits come with no requirement that an individual household must <MORE> experienced a power outage for \u201c more than two hours ,\u201d or that applicants must provide photographic <MASK> of such outages . <PARA> the appropriate place to apply for disaster - snap assistance in florida is the access florida web page . <PARA> other assistance is available <PARA> as well as disaster - snap , existing food stamp recipients can avail themselves of certain other enhanced benefits in light of the damage and disruption caused by hurricane irma . <PARA> according to the united <MASK> department of agriculture \u2019 s food and nutrition service , which oversees snap , regular florida recipients can ( as of 12 september 2017 ) temporarily use ebt cards to buy hot food ( something they cannot normally do ) and should have received their monthly allotment earlier than usual in september : <PARA> in addition to these modifications , several types of federally - provided assistance are available to those affected by disasters such as hurricanes irma and harvey , both in florida and in other <MASK> . these benefits include monetary assistance with rent and home repairs as well as funeral and medical care costs , as well as direct assistance such as fema \u2019 s entering into lease agreements with owners of multi - family rental properties and performing repairs , with the aim of providing temporary accommodation for individuals . <PARA> variations in eligibility , rates of payment , duration of assistance , and type of assistance mean that it \u2019 s virtually impossible to say how much an individual household or person might receive . residents of <MASK> that have been affected by hurricanes and other disasters can check whether they are eligible for federal assistance , and apply for such assistance , by visiting disasterassistance . gov . <PARA> the <MASK> asserted in one of the facebook <MASK> , that fema is offering individuals $ 500 via direct deposit to be used for purchasing food , has a grain of truth to it . <PARA> as part of the assistance that the federal government provides to individuals and households in <MASK> where major disasters have been declared ( as was the case in florida ), individuals who have lost their homes or been displaced can apply for what \u2019 s known as critical needs assistance , which consists of a one - time payment of $ 500 , as explained by fema : <PARA> however , the <MASK> must first ask fema to authorize critical needs assistance in specific counties particularly badly hit by a disaster , fema must then grant that authorization , and the individual must go through an application process . fema has authorized critical needs assistance in certain florida counties , which are listed on the fema web site . <PARA> the critical needs assistance application is available only to individuals who have lost their homes or been displaced , and who had previously resided in counties where fema has authorized critical needs assistance .",

        "text": "u . s . education secretary betsy devos , a frequent target of criticism from left - leaning observers and activists in the united <MASK> , came under renewed scrutiny in march 2019 after the publication of her department \u2019 s 2020 budget request , which proposed eliminating almost $ 6 . 7 billion in spending on 29 different programs . <PARA> in particular , devos faced criticism for what was presented as the proposed elimination of \u201c all $ 18 million \u201d in spending on the special olympics . <PARA> on 26 march , the left - leaning occupy democrats facebook page posted a meme that read : <PARA> \u201c just when you thought the trump administration couldn \u2019 t possibly stoop any lower , education secretary betsy devos is now trying to eliminate all $ 18 million in funding for the special olympics ...\u201d <PARA> the post linked to a detroit free press <MASK> that reported the following : <PARA> the department of education \u2019 s 2020 budget proposals did indeed call for the total elimination of \u201c special olympics education programs ,\u201d a savings of $ 17 . 6 million , very close to the \u201c$ 18 million \u201d <MASK> by occupy democrats . <PARA> the full list of programs marked for elimination can be found on page 49 of the department \u2019 s budget request and total roughly $ 6 . 67 billion in savings . <PARA> devos also proposed eliminating her department \u2019 s funding for the special olympics in the 2018 and 2019 financial year budgets , to the tune of $ 10 . 1 million and $ 12 . 6 million , respectively . on all three occasions , the explanation given for the proposal has been the same : <PARA> \u201c this program supports a directed grant award to a not - for - profit organization . funds are used to expand the special olympics and the design and implementation of special olympics education programs . such activities are better supported with other federal , <MASK> , local , or private funds .\u201d <PARA> the proposal to eliminate the special olympics programs did not make it into the final versions of the 2018 or 2019 budgets . democrats in the house of representatives strongly opposed devos \u2019 $ 17 . 6 million cut for 2020 during her appearance at a 26 march hearing of the labor , health and human services , education and related agencies subcommittee of the house appropriations committee : <PARA> given that democrats have had a majority in the house of representatives since january 2019 , it is highly unlikely that devos \u2019 proposal to eliminate the special olympics programs will be implemented for 2020 either . <PARA> during the 26 march hearing , devos told the subcommittee : \u201c we had to make some difficult decisions with this budget \u201d and justified her proposal by affirming that , roughly speaking , the special olympics receives enough funding from other sources , saying : \u201c special olympics is an awesome organization , one that is well - supported by the philanthropic sector as well .\u201d <PARA> in a press release on 27 march , devos outlined her rationale at greater length , saying : <PARA> special olympics inc . and its affiliates received a total of $ 15 . 46 million in federal grants during the 2017 calendar year , just under 10 . 4 percent of its total revenue of $ 148 . 7 million , according to the charity \u2019 s 2017 financial report , the most recent such document published on its website . <PARA> by contrast , individual and corporate contributions and sponsorships made up 46 percent of the charity \u2019 s revenue in 2017 , and direct - mail contributions provided 30 percent . <PARA> readers and viewers of some news reports on 26 and 27 march may have been given the impression that devos had proposed ending all federal government funding of special olympics , such as when msnbc \u2019 s andrea mitchell <MASK> that the education secretary had proposed \u201c eliminating all federal money \u2014 all federal money \u2014 from the [ 2020 federal ] budget .\u201d <PARA> in fact , special olympics receives funding from at least one other federal agency , the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ), which is overseen by the department of health and human services . <PARA> according to that department \u2019 s grant - tracking database taggs , the cdc provided special olympics inc . $ 62 . 6 million in grants between 2007 and 2019 , with $ 23 . 9 million being provided since 2017 , and $ 9 . 9 million in 2019 alone . that funding has largely gone to two projects : \u201c healthy athletes \u201d and \u201c inclusive health .\u201d <PARA> the department of health and human services \u2019 2020 budget request does not contain any mention of the cdc \u2019 s special olympics grants , nor any proposals to eliminate that funding . <PARA> we asked a spokesperson for special olympics to provide a breakdown of the funding it receives from federal government departments and agencies , but unfortunately we did not receive a response in time for publication . <PARA> it \u2019 s not <MASK> to say that devos proposed in march 2019 to put an end to all federal funding of special olympics . however , she certainly did propose , in her department \u2019 s budget request , to eliminate all the funding at her disposal , in her capacity as secretary of education \u2014 $ 17 . 6 million for special olympics education programs \u2014 and she then publicly defended that proposal .",

        "text": "<MASK> : we tend to think of albert einstein purely as a man of science , the towering genius of the 20th century who spent most of his life steeped in mathematics and physics while he probed the mysteries of the universe . but a less well known facet of einstein \u2019 s life is that he was also a gifted and enthusiatic violinist and pianist who often sought solace in music , both as a performer and a listener . indeed , he once asserted that had he not been a scientist , he would have been a musician : <PARA> einstein \u2019 s mother , pauline , was a talented pianist who brought music to life in the family home . albert began to learn the violin at the age of six , while his family was still living in munich . however , he toiled under unimaginative tuition until discovering the joys of mozart \u2019 s sonatas at the age of 13 . from that point on , although he had no further lessons , his violin remained his constant companion . <PARA> when einstein moved to aarau in switzerland in 1895 to complete his schooling , he seems to have devoted a good deal of his time to music . it is recorded that he worked <PARA> hard on the brahms g - major violin sonata in order to get the full benefit from a visit to aarau of the great violinist joseph joachim , on whose programme it appeared . just before his 17th birthday albert played at a music examination in the cantonal school . the inspector reported that \u201c a student called einstein shone in a deeply felt <PARA> performance of an adagio from one of the beethoven sonatas \u201d. in addition to his prowess on the violin , he also played the piano and , in particular , loved to improvise . <PARA> so although it \u2019 s not inconceivable that einstein might have been photographed noodling around on musical instrument , it is extremely unlikely that that instrument would have been an electric guitar . einstein was a violinist and sometime pianist ; there is no record of his ever giving the guitar a try . moreover , einstein \u2019 s musical tastes were decidedly conservative , favoring bach and mozart while eschewing contemporary composers such as wagner , so he almost certainly would not have favored any form of music that one would be likely to play on the type of instrument he \u2019 s pictured holding here . <PARA> in any case we don \u2019 t have to speculate about einstein \u2019 s musical interests , because this picture is clearly a photograph of the mississippi guitar legend and bluesman known as t - model ford , into which someone has inserted an image <PARA> of the famed scientist \u2019 s head :",

        "text": "in the days immediately following hurricane irma making landfall in florida in early september 2017 , many floridians lost electrical power \u2014 including those with solar panels . shortly after the powerful storm hit , the alternative weekly newspaper miami new times offered an explanation as to why those with solar panels , who seemingly should be unaffected by a utility grid failure so long as there is sunlight , were also , quite literally , in the dark . <PARA> in a 14 september 2017 <MASK> , the new times reported that thanks to lobbying , the utilities company florida power & light ( fpl ) had so much undue leverage over when and whether customers could make use of solar panels that they were able to prevent solar users from accessing sun - based electricity in irma \u2019 s aftermath . the new times reported : <PARA> although the \u201c big corporate government / axis of evil \u201d narrative was too juicy for many conspiracy sites to pass up , floridians are not , in fact , mandated by law to connect solar panels to the power grid . utility providers are instead required to allow customers to connect their solar panels to the grid for \u201c net metering ,\u201d meaning they can enjoy lower utility bills if their homes generate more power than they use , because excess power is sold back to the utility company . florida <MASK> actually makes it unlawful for any entity block residents from having solar panels . <PARA> further , fpl doesn \u2019 t \u201c mandate \u201d that solar panels power down if the grid goes offline in a crisis . this is a safety precaution and industry - wide standard put in place to prevent line workers from being electrocuted while restoring power during an outage \u2014 and it is not unique to florida . the \u201c mandate \u201d cited by the new times is in fact a guideline which reflects this standard and includes an important caveat . the guideline reads ( emphasis added ): <PARA> we asked patrick altier , owner of the florida - based energy company solar trek , to explain further . altier told us that floridians who have solar panels on their homes can use energy from the sun during a grid failure \u2014 if they purchase additional equipment to prevent volts of electricity from traveling through power lines and harming unsuspecting neighbors or repair crews . to illustrate this , he gave us two scenarios : <PARA> the reason many homeowners don \u2019 t have the additional equipment necessary to allow them to keep their power on when the grid is down is because of the purchasing cost , said mark bubriski , director of public affairs for fpl . however , if customers have installed a battery system , such as a tesla powerwall or an sma sunny island , they can use their solar panels safely during a grid failure . no laws or mandates prohibit them from doing so . <PARA> conspiratorial theorizing about living off - grid is not new and tends to be popular , perhaps because it plays on the always - present american distrust of both governmental and corporate overreach . that perhaps explains why the new times <MASK> struck a nerve \u2014 it reports , for example , that \u201c fpl is ... allowed to disconnect your panels from the grid without warning you . the company can even put a padlock on it .\u201d it also reports that utilities companies can \u201c charge a $ 400 or $ 1 , 000 application fee for consumers who want to install systems more powerful than 10 kilowatts .\u201d <PARA> these are not misleading characterizations , but they make mundane operations seem ominous , bubriski said . technically , fpl can shut off power without warning for safety reasons , such as in the case of a fire or other hazard . fpl can also padlock certain inverters on large systems with manual shutoff switches to ensure the only ones able to access it are fpl workers . he also explained that the application fees , particularly the higher ones , wouldn \u2019 t affect most customers because the tiered fees only come into play for systems twice the size of the average florida home . <PARA> that is not to say fpl hasn \u2019 t been criticized \u2014 and as with any topic of public interest , there are legitimate concerns to be raised . for example , some have criticized the speed with which fpl restored power after irma ( as of 25 september 2017 , all fpl customers who lost power during irma have been brought back online ). and fpl and the local industry at large have been dragged for drafting what critics call favorable legislation . these stories , however , aren \u2019 t as clickable as the big - government - big - corporate conglomerate robbing the american public of free energy , which may explain why that is the one that made national headlines despite its mendacity .",

        "text": "so often those \u201c everybody knows \u201d facts we naively place reliance upon turn out to be embarrassingly <MASK> . such is not the case here , in that there is some truth to the \u201c u . s . currency tainted by cocaine \u201d <MASK> , but the implications of this conversation - stopping fact are far more mundane than we might initially presume . to put it another way , it \u2019 s less shocking a fact than we first perceive it to be because the underlying assumption \u2014 that every bill bearing traces of cocaine got that way through having been used to inhale lines of cocaine \u2014 is <MASK> . <PARA> contrary to our first thought upon encountering this interesting little fact , that trace amounts of cocaine turn up on approximately four of every five bills in circulation doesn \u2019 t mean the now - contaminated currency was at one time used to snort coke or passed through the dope - laden paws of seedy characters . rather , the drug is easily conveyed from one bill to another because cocaine in powdered form is extremely fine . <PARA> when a cocaine - contaminated bill is processed through a sorting or counting machine , traces of the drug are easily passed to other bills in the same batch . atms serve to spread tiny amounts of cocaine to nearly all the currency they distribute , as do the counting machines used in banks and casinos . <PARA> how widespread is the contamination ? no one appears to have the definitive answer , as every study comes up with a different percentage . ( for simplicity \u2019 s sake , we \u2019 ll say \u201c four of five \u201d throughout this <MASK> because that \u2019 s the worst - case scenario , and the figure is representative of the results of some reports , including the most recent one we could find .) <PARA> in one 1985 study done by the u . s . drug enforcement administration on the money machines in a u . s . federal reserve district bank , random samples of $ 50 and $ 100 bills revealed that a third to a half of all the currency tested bore traces of cocaine . moreover , the machines themselves were often found to test positive , meaning that subsequent batches of cash fed through them would also pick up cocaine residue . expert <MASK> given before a federal appeals court in 1995 showed that three out of four bills randomly examined in the los angeles area bore traces of the drug . in a 1997 study conducted at the argonne national laboratory , nearly four out of five one - dollar bills in chicago suburbs were found to bear discernible traces of cocaine . in another study , more than 135 bills from seven u . s . cities were tested , and all but four were contaminated with traces of cocaine . these bills had been collected from restaurants , stores , and banks in cities from milwaukee to dallas . <PARA> a single bill used to snort cocaine or otherwise mingled with the drug can contaminate an entire cash drawer . when counting and sorting machines ( which fan the bills , and thus the cocaine ) are factored in , it \u2019 s no wonder that so much of the currency now in circulation wouldn \u2019 t pass any purity tests . <PARA> the average person need not fear that the money in his wallet will inadvertently get him high , or that the act of paying for his burger and fries at mcdonald \u2019 s will cause him to fail a random drug test . only those whose jobs call upon them to handle an extremely large number of bills every day need worry that enough cocaine is getting on their hands to be detectable . bank tellers or those who work in the soft count rooms of casinos , for instance , might need to consider the effects of this contamination , but not average folks \u2014 not even ones who occasionally carry a great deal of cash about their persons . <PARA> as to how much cocaine will be on a contaminated bill , the expert witness in that 1995 court case charted results from as small as a nanogram ( one - billionth of a gram ) to as much as a milligram ( one - thousandth of a gram ). the argonne national laboratory study revealed that the average contamination was 16 micrograms ( which is 16 one - millionths of a gram ). if you \u2019 re not quite sure how much a gram of cocaine is , picture the head of a thumbtack . <PARA> these are very small amounts indeed , a fact that should be kept in mind as we speed off to share this startling new information about drugs on our money with friends and neighbors . this is not the latest , newest lurking danger to our health and welfare , nor is it an apocalyptic sign that drugs are taking over . yes , drug use in our society is real , but it has yet to reach the proportions where four of every five bills in our wallets has been used to snort cocaine . that four of five bills might test positive only means that 80 % of our paper money has at some time come into contact with contaminated bills or counting machines . it takes only one bill to contaminate hundreds or even thousands of others , so the number of bills that have actually come into direct contact with the drug trade is far smaller than we might first assume upon seeing that \u201c four of five \u201d <MASK> marked as <MASK> .",

        "text": "an old <MASK> about edith piaf got a new lease of life in october 2017 , when a web site devoted to \u201c positive and meaningful content \u201d produced a short video recounting the iconic french singer \u2019 s purported heroism during world war two . <PARA> on 17 october , fabiosa australia posted an animated video to its facebook page , telling the following <MASK> : <PARA> neither the video nor the accompanying facebook post provides any source , but this is an old tale that has been modified and embellished over the decades . according to one source , piaf saved \u201c thousands \u201d of jews ( not 120 ) from the nazi camps , and in another iteration it was the prisoners themselves who made their own fake ids . <PARA> according to carolyn burke \u2019 s 2011 biography of piaf , she used a seven - week tour of prisoner - of - war camps in germany as a way to help carry out a mission for her secretary andr\u00e9e \u201c d\u00e9d\u00e9e \u201d bigard , who was part of the anti - nazi resistance movement : <PARA> shortly after her return home from germany , according to burke , piaf was \u201c already planning her next trip there \u201d: <PARA> according to later interviews given by bigard , piaf visited 11 stalags on that trip to germany and \u2014 in burke \u2019 s words \u2014 distributed \u201c identity cards , maps and compasses . sometimes the escaped prisoners caught up with her tour and were passed off as musicians .\u201d the mission was ended when officials at one of the camps became suspicious . <PARA> in french journalist robert belleret \u2019 s biography piaf , un mythe fran\u00e7ais , andr\u00e9e bigard is <MASK> as saying that the singer had been part of a \u201c resistance network \u201d: <PARA> after the liberation of france by the allies , and the end of world war two , france underwent what was known as the \u201c \u00e9puration sauvage \u201d ( the \u201c wild purge \u201d) \u2014 essentially a period of informal and often brutal revenge against those who had aided the nazis in their annexation of france . <PARA> according to the political scientist michael curtis , between 9 , 000 and 10 , 000 suspected collaborationists were killed . after this , official tribunals were set up and a period known as the \u201c \u00e9puration legale \u201d ( the \u201c legal purge \u201d) ensued . tens of thousands of people were jailed , 6 , 763 were sentenced to death , and 768 of these were executed . <PARA> edith piaf was believed by some to have been a collaborator , due to her tours of prisoner - of - war camps and participation in nazi propaganda efforts , and she was called to testify before a tribunal with a focus on french artists . <PARA> according to carolyn burke , the tribunal had included her name in a list of musicians whose voice was to be banned from french radio , something that would have been a significant blow to her career . however , she testified that her first trip to germany was made under coercion , and the second one was undertaken for the <MASK> purpose of giving prisoners money and helping them escape . <PARA> andr\u00e9e bigard backed up piaf \u2019 s account , and the singer was cleared . shortly after her testimony in october 1944 , she gave an interview to the ce soir newspaper , in which she provided the now famous number of 118 soldiers having been saved by her actions , and remarked : <PARA> however , robert belleret casts doubt on this version of events , pointing out implausibilities and inconsistencies in the account and suggesting that the <MASK> might have been concocted so as to justify piaf \u2019 s visits to germany ( which were intended and used by the nazis as propaganda in vichy france ), and to save herself from the wrath of the tribunals : <PARA> belleret lists some of the purported details of piaf \u2019 s efforts to help jewish people ( sending them money and housing them ) during the nazi occupation , but notes that these names and numbers were provided by piaf herself and her loyal secretary andr\u00e9e bigard , and that they could not be verified . <PARA> carolyn burke \u2019 s biography , which casts a less skeptical and more positive light on edith piaf , also does not contain corroborating <MASK> ( that is , <MASK> provided by someone other than piaf or bigard ). it is possible that such <MASK> exists , or once existed but has been lost , or that the individuals who could prove that edith piaf helped them escape are no longer alive . but without such testimony , establishing the veracity of this famous old <MASK> remains elusive .",

        "text": "in december 2015 , a meme titled \u201c meet rachel hoffman \u201d became popular on social media : <PARA> social media interest in hoffman was piqued when the facebook page free talk live shared the meme on 7 december 2015 : <PARA> the meme was spread as part of a debate over whether drug law enforcement was more detrimental to society as a whole than drug use . although most commenters were horrified to hear of hoffman \u2019 s fate , at least one was less than sympathetic , holding that hoffman was not simply a recreational drug user caught up in a nightmare scenario with drug dealers but a drug dealer herself : <PARA> as many viewers surmised , hoffman \u2019 s <MASK> was far too complex to be accurately summarized by an image meme . the basic assertions of the meme were accurate , though significant details were obscured by its brief verbiage . <PARA> on 22 february 2007 , florida <MASK> university graduate rachel hoffman was found to be in possession of a relatively small amount of marijuana ( 25 grams ) during a routine traffic stop . contemporaneous news reports about hoffman tended to begin with her tragic death and work backwards , so details of her involvement with police after that traffic stop were revealed slowly and sometimes only after initial , less accurate information was reported . <PARA> according to a local news report , on 17 april 2008 , while hoffman was under drug court supervision stemming the february 2007 traffic stop , tallahassee police searched her apartment and turned up cannabis and a small quantity of ecstasy : <PARA> a 13 may 2008 abc news <MASK> ( published on the same day hoffman was buried ) offered initial information about how that traffic stop eventually led to hoffman \u2019 s bullet - ridden body being found in a ditch in april 2008 : <PARA> questions frequently up in discussions of hoffman \u2019 s death involved the amounts of various drugs she purportedly possessed and whether she was herself selling marijuana and other substances . a september 2013 post written by hoffman \u2019 s friend elizabeth patty - lugo and titled \u201c my best friend rachel hoffman was murdered at 23 - years - old \u201d said that police estimates of hoffman \u2019 s involvement in the drug trade were wildly implausible : <PARA> patty - lugo \u2019 s lengthy account described the circumstances under which hoffman \u2019 s home was raided , as well as the choice hoffman faced following the raid ( emphasizing hoffman \u2019 s request that patty - lugo covertly film the buy - bust , and hoffman \u2019 s fears that the police would deny her \u201c credit \u201d for the risky undertaking .) by patty - lugo \u2019 s account , police convinced rachel that she would be \u201c covered \u201d at all times during the operation , and that the worst possible outcome would be a <MORE> individuals like hoffman in drug enforcement operations . focusing on the \u201c recruitment of young informants often involves risks that are incommensurate with the charges that they are facing ,\u201d stillman painted hoffman as out of her depth and without recourse : <PARA> among the details uncovered in the years following hoffman \u2019 s death was that the \u201c raid \u201d could never have succeeded as planned . hoffman , pressured to participate in a narcotics transaction far out of her league , was pegged as a mark by her assailants : <PARA> another element stillman focused on in her piece was the initial <MASK> made by police when news of hoffman \u2019 s death broke . on the morning hoffman \u2019 s body was found , the tallahassee police department ( tpd ) told the press hoffman had brought about her own death not following protocol . hoffman \u2019 s parents later described that moment as the start of \u201c the smearing \u201d of their daughter : <PARA> rachel \u2019 s body was found on 9 may 2008 , and a local news <MASK> published that day included the following passage , suggesting her involvement with the buy - bust was voluntary and that she had ignored precautions set up for her in the preparations for the buy - bust : <PARA> according to stillman \u2019 s piece ( and several other <MASK> ), hoffman \u2019 s parents were ultimately awarded $ 2 . 6 million in a wrongful death suit against the city of tallahassee and provided a formal apology . hoffman \u2019 s parents also founded an organization devoted to warning young people about the risks of becoming confidential informants . <PARA> on 1 july 2009 a bill known as \u201c rachel \u2019 s law \u201d was adopted in florida , aimed at providing greater protection to individuals find themselves in situations such as rachel hoffman \u2019 s . <PARA> andrea green and deneilo bradshaw were sentenced to life in prison for the murder of hoffman . <PARA> ultimately , the basic facts of the meme were correct . rachel hoffman was caught at a traffic stop in possession of a small amount of marijuana ; a raid conducted while she was under subsequent drug court supervision turned up a handful of pills and a few ounces of marijuana . under threat of prosecution , hoffman agreed to act as a confidential informant but lacked criminal connections to fulfill police requests . in an effort to avoid prosecution , she engaged in a police - supervised transaction with known criminals under orders to purchase massive quantities of drugs and a firearm . the men with whom she transacted intended to rip her off and sell her aspirin ; upon discovering a wire improperly placed in her purse , they murdered her . by all accounts , hoffman was a regular user of marijuana who sold small quantities to friends , and not a career drug dealer .",

<PARA> it \u2019 s difficult to determine at this point whether phillips has deliberately misrepresented the nature of his service , whether he has been so vague and ambiguous in many of his descriptions ( unintentionally or otherwise ) that misinterpretations have entered his narrative , or whether he has tried to be accurate but may have just occasionally slipped up in his many , many hours of conversation and sometimes neglected to include the qualifiers about his service that he has used in many other videos and press interviews . nonetheless , at times it has certainly sounded as though phillips was trying to foster the impression that he had both served during the vietnam war and had been deployed to vietnam at some point during his service , even if he didn \u2019 t literally say so . <PARA> we note that veteran \u2019 s affairs ( va ), for the purposes of determining eligibility for va pension benefits , considers the vietnam era to be the period between 28 february 1961 to 7 may 1975 for those who served in vietnam , and between 5 august 1964 and 7 may 1975 ( a window during which phillips \u2019 reported service falls ) for those who served elsewhere . the military times noted that phillips had \u201c spent four years in the marine corps reserve and left in 1976 with the rank of private , or e - 1 , the marines said in a <MASK> providing his personal releasable information ,\u201d but we haven \u2019 t yet been obtained copies of phillips \u2019 official service records to verify exactly when and where he might have served . <PARA> ( we note that an image purporting to be a copy of phillips \u2019 dd form 214 \u2014 certificate of release or discharge from active duty \u2014 has been circulated on social media , but that image has not yet been verified .)",

<PARA> the idea that sexual crimes in sweden are rising isn \u2019 t limited to partisan media . on 8 february 2017 , the mainstream american publication usa today made a <MASK> similar to farage \u2019 s comments : <PARA> but , again , this apparent disparity may have less to do with the amount of rape in each country , and more to do with a difference in how each country defines and records rape . <PARA> for one thing , sweden tallies each incident as a separate case , even if the accusation , perpetrator and victim are the same , a practice that may create confusion on an international level . crimes are also counted at the point of contact with police , not when convictions are made . this could make the level of crime appear higher than it is when viewing raw data without qualifying information . br\u00e5 researcher johanna olseryd told us : <PARA> also , sweden has a broader definition of rape than some of its european neighbors . until recently in germany , for example , the victim having said no to a sexual act was not always enough to meet the legal definition of rape . <PARA> kristine eck , a researcher at uppsala university , argued in a february 2017 washington post op - ed that because sweden is particularly thorough in recording and publicly reporting crime , it may lead to the <MASK> impression that crime is higher there than elsewhere . <PARA> there is simply no data to show that sweden is the rape capital of europe , or even that rape is on the rise in the country .",

        "text": "as political rhetoric about the dangers of immigration grew to a \u201c full trumpism \u201d fever pitch in the run - up to the 2018 u . s . midterm elections , several online meme - makers and anti - immigration pundits ratcheted up speculation about the potential health risks posed by immigration across the southern u . s . border . <PARA> such <MASK> were usually heavily speculative \u201c what if \u201d <MASK> , tended to be light on factual analysis or good - faith arguments , and were usually attached to misleading or unrelated photos in an effort to generate fear . <PARA> \u201c what about diseases ?\u201d brian kilmeade opined in a 29 october 2018 \u201c fox & friends \u201d segment about a central american caravan , \u201c i mean , there \u2019 s a reason you can \u2019 t bring a kid to school unless he \u2019 s inoculated .\u201d kilmeade did not provide any factual <MASK> to suggest an increased risk of disease from caravan members , nor did he indicate what kind of diseases were of concern . <PARA> nearly all arguments or memes asserting a risk of disease from southern border crossing used photographs and news stories from a specific outbreak that occurred in that area during in the summer of 2014 . a representative post of this ilk displayed a photograph and posited that \u201c the bumps on this illegal \u2019 s body who was detained from the caravan @ the border is smallpox \u201d: <PARA> the accompanying image showed a man with a case of scabies ( a dermatologic condition caused by mites ), not smallpox , however . <PARA> the photograph used in this 2 november 2018 meme was taken by u . s . rep . henry cuellar at a customs and border protection facility in south texas and was first published by the houston chronicle on 11 june 2014 . that year saw the beginning of a large influx of central americans attempting to cross into the united <MASK> , an event attributed largely to increasing political unrest and poverty in el salvador , guatemala , and honduras , and one which overwhelmed the existing u . s . immigration and border patrol capacities at the time . <PARA> the 2014 scabies outbreak was heavily reported on by right - wing outlets such as breitbart and the washington times . these outlets and many others uncritically repeated speculative fears presented in local news segments , and they continued to be cited to justify fears of disease from immigrants in 2018 . it is therefore informative to look at the fears raised in these 2014 stories to see if they were justified . <PARA> a 10 june 2014 <MASK> in the washington times raised concerns that diseases \u201c of an even more serious nature \u201d than scabies could infect the united <MASK> ( emphasis on speculative language ours ): <PARA> breitbart \u2019 s coverage from 27 may 2014 raised <MORE> cited concerns that immigrants from central american countries were bringing zika ( one of the diseases attributed to immigrants in the 2018 immigration memes ) to the united <MASK> in 2015 . while pundits attempted to blame illegal immigration for zika cases in the united <MASK> , the numbers do not support such a conclusion : <PARA> in 2016 , 185 million legal northbound crossings took place at ports of entry along the 2 , 000 - mile border between the united <MASK> and mexico . by comparison , the number of migrants in the latest caravan ( 2018 ) is in the thousands . <PARA> another relevant point is that many of the maladies listed in anti - immigration memes concern diseases that are all but eradicated in the united <MASK> thanks to vaccination efforts . polio , for example , has been considered eradicated from the entire american continent since 1994 . <PARA> in fact , many of the countries in central america from which the migrants are attempting to flee have higher vaccination rates for diseases such as measles than the united <MASK> does . in 2017 , 92 % of children aged 12 - 23 months were vaccinated for measles in the united <MASK> . in mexico and honduras that figure was higher , at 96 % and 97 % respectively . el salvador and guatemala have seen a recent decline in vaccination rates , with 85 % and 86 % coverage in 2017 . regardless , the notion that these commonly vaccinated conditions are in wide circulation outside of the united <MASK> and therefore present in higher levels in border - crossing immigrants is dubious . <PARA> a measles outbreak in an arizona immigration detention facility occurred in 2016 , infecting both staff and detainees , but it did not spread to the general public . its peril to the u . s . staff stemmed primarily from a lack of vaccination on the part of the staff working there . rush limbaugh attempted to blame a different measles outbreak at disneyland in 2015 on illegal immigration , but that outbreak was exacerbated not by illegal immigration but by lower than average vaccination rates in southern california . <PARA> while the cdc does suggest some risk of communicable disease transmission across the southern border , they do not attribute it to illegal immigration , but rather to the high level of transportation across the border in general : <PARA> in short , while detained populations of people held in close quarters carry a higher risk for the transmission of communicable diseases such as scabies or tuberculosis within that population , no <MASK> suggests that those populations pose a health risk to the surrounding communities . efforts on the internet to make that risk appear acute do so by misrepresenting out - of - date figures and by ignoring the epidemiological realities of a world that sees one billion people cross international borders every year .",

        "text": "to \u201c let the cat out of the bag \u201d is one of those sayings wherein meaning is instinctively grasped even if it \u2019 s difficult to coherently put into words why this is so . while this phrase is a widespread shortform for truth coming to light , there is nothing obvious about why a cat \u2019 s being released from a sack should have anything to do with a secret \u2019 s being revealed . ( even so , it \u2019 s a handy phrase to have in one \u2019 s linguistic arsenal , in that there \u2019 s no one word in the english language that conveys the revelation , deliberate or accidental , of information that was intended to be kept hush - hush .) <PARA> the most widely believed theory about the saying \u2019 s <MASK> asserts it has to do with chicanery practiced upon those purchasing livestock . according to its lights , unscrupulous sellers of pigs would hastily swap a cat for the porker that had been purchased and bagged for easier transport when the buyer looked away for a moment , with the duped purchaser discovering the substitution only upon returning home and letting the cat out of the bag . <PARA> although numerous etymology books tout this explanation as the phrase \u2019 s <MASK> , common sense should serve to dismiss it . for the duped livestock purchaser theory to be right , the seller \u2019 s deception would come to light only when the cat was let out of the bag . yet , bag or not , it \u2019 s nigh on impossible to mistake a cat for a pig . at very least , anyone this deception was tried upon would quickly conclude there was something mighty wrong about its porker long before he opened the bag to see what was going on inside . <PARA> housecats and pigs are not of comparable size , so a sack containing the one instead of the other isn \u2019 t going to fool a buyer , in that the filled bag is going to be a fair bit smaller than it was before the sleight of hand . even if a large cat were shoved into the bag in place of a rather small pig , due to the nature of the build of each of these types of critters , the weight is going to be badly off \u2014 since cats are rather loosely constructed compared to far more densely - fleshed pigs , the cat is going to weigh far less than the porker even when both animals are the same size . <PARA> cats also behave far differently than pigs . while a pig encased in a sack might squeal or oink as it \u2019 s carried home , a cat is going to spit , yowl , hiss , and meow . we think you \u2019 d have to search high and low to find anyone <MORE> the cat out of the bag \u201d to have as its <MASK> a practice of cats being surreptitiously foisted upon the unwary as pigs by crooked farmers , said fraud would have had to have been successfully run on so many that its denouement worked its way into the language ( and that via folks not figuring out they \u2019 d been had until they got home ). there weren \u2019 t that many fools in the middle ages : if there had been , the species wouldn \u2019 t have survived . <PARA> we suspect the duped livestock purchaser explanation was borrowed from the admonishment about not buying a pig in a poke , a saying that reliably dates to 1555 ( with its antecedent \u201c when a pig is offered , open the poke \u201d dating to 1325 ). that homily cautions against buying goods one has not examined ( as opposed to afterwards checking goods already examined and purchased to assure no one has covertly exchanged them for less valuable commodities ). <PARA> a second theory ascribes the <MASK> of the saying to the british royal navy , asserting the instrument of punishment used upon those errant in their duties or behaviors ( a whip called the \u2018 cat of nine tails \u2019 or \u2018 cat - o \u2019- nine - tails \u2019) was routinely kept in a red sack , thereby a sailor who brought to light the transgressions of another was \u201c letting the cat out of the bag .\u201d however , no <MASK> documents that such whips were commonly stored in sacks , or that the phrase \u201c let the cat out of the bag \u201d was initially associated with maritime <MASK> or usage . <PARA> as to where the saying did come from , there is as yet no clear answer . possibly \u201c letting the cat out of the bag \u201d was always meant as no more than an entertaining mental image of the explosiveness of a confidence \u2019 s revelation \u2014 usually what is deliberately concealed is of a salacious or titillating nature , thus there are often huge elements of shock and surprise when the truth comes out , somewhat akin to the commotion raised by a frightened cat suddenly loosed from the bag that had imprisoned it . or it could have to do with a similarity between the behavior of both secrets and cats \u2014 once either is let out , they go wherever they want . ( in other words , private news that has been made public spreads far and wide , despite all efforts to keep it contained to a small circle of confidantes or even to silence it altogether .) or it could be that \u201c let the cat out of the bag \u201d was a line from a play now lost to us wherein the connection between moggies and sacks and secrets was all made clear to the audiences enthralled by it .",

        "text": "precious few who are under the weather skip happily into hospitals , a song on their lips , and not a care in the world . typical inpatients worry about many things : the condition that \u2019 s caused them to be hospitalized , being away from their homes and families , and even the quality of medical care they will receive while hospitalized . <PARA> the piece <MASK> above ( which we began seeing circulated in e - mail in june 2010 ) speaks to that last concern . its text was harvested from a 4 march 2010 wall street journal \u2018 s smartmoney magazine <MASK> titled \u201c 10 things your hospital won \u2019 t tell you ,\u201d where its topic of july mortality rates in hospitals appeared as item nine . <PARA> that seemingly helpful heads - up is a summary of information pulled from another source , with some key aspects left out . the \u201c 10 things \u201d item drew its information from a 2005 national bureau of economic research <MASK> titled \u201c cohort turnover and productivity : the july phenomenon in teaching hospitals .\u201d that paper examined what is termed \u201c the july phenomenon ,\u201d \u201c the july effect ,\u201d or \u201c the new resident hypothesis \u201d: a reduction in quality of service related to the annual turnover of house staff in teaching hospitals . using patient - level data gathered from roughly 700 hospitals per year over the period from 1993 to 2001 , it concluded that there is a measurable increase in both length of patient stay and rates of patient mortality during the july - august transition , when experienced residents and interns are replaced by new ones . <PARA> key to the understanding that paper , however , is noting that its conclusions apply solely to teaching hospitals , institutions where residents and interns treat patients as part of their medical training . it \u2019 s therefore not <MASK> that all hospitals become a bit more dangerous in july . it \u2019 s also not <MASK> that all teaching hospitals experience this decline . as the paper noted , \u201c in fact , the most - intensive teaching hospitals manage to avoid significant effects on mortality following this turnover \u201d thanks to better supervision of new doctors . <PARA> however , at teaching institutions where oversight of new staff is less stringent , the \u201c july effect \u201d is real . moreover , it lasts not merely throughout that month but for the rest of the calendar year as well . while risk - adjusted mortality rates may rise by roughly 4 percent in the july - august period , that increase remains at between 2 and 4 percent until the new year , resulting in 8 to 14 additional deaths per annum at a typical teaching hospital . <PARA> the increase in patient deaths does not , as many people assume , have to do mostly with untrained surgeons running <MORE> university of california , san diego examined computerized death certificates from 1979 - 2006 , focusing on the certificates of inpatients , outpatients , and those who died in the emergency department , in which medication error was recorded as the primary cause of death . ( computerized death certificates do not record whether the patient died in a teaching hospital , but they do record the county of death , so researchers looked at the proportion of major teaching hospitals in each county .) counties containing teaching hospitals experienced a 10 % rise in fatal medication errors in july , whereas counties lacking teaching hospitals did not experience that spike . the lethal mistakes included dispensing the wrong drugs , overdoses , and accidents involving drugs or biological agents . <PARA> in a bit that didn \u2019 t come from any of the studies discussed above , the e - mailed item asserts : <PARA> surgeons aren \u2019 t necessarily at their best first thing in the morning : like other mere mortals , some are bright - eyed and bushy - tailed as soon as their eyes snap open but fade as the day goes on , others hit their strides no earlier than the afternoon , and others are everywhere in between . similarly , the day of the week doesn \u2019 t appear to affect the skill level of surgeons . <PARA> according to an october 2009 <MASK> in the journal anesthesiology ( produced by the american society of anesthesiologists ), there is no bad time of the day , week , or year to have elective coronary artery bypass graft surgery , thus one needn \u2019 t worry about being a thursday or friday operation . it had been postulated the crazy hours surgeons work would impart fatigue - related disadvantages to patients who underwent operations later in the week , yet that did not prove to be the case : results from surgeries performed early and late in the week and at different times of the day were all similar . the reason why coronary artery bypass grafting was studied was because that procedure is the most common heart surgery , and there are well - established protocols for it . the analysis was limited to elective operations because emergency procedures are inherently riskier and are often performed on patients that have additional medical problems . <PARA> yet being the first under the knife on any given day may confer certain advantages to the patient . being early on the day \u2019 s roster means one \u2019 s surgery will start on time , whereas patients booked later in the day may find their procedures pushed back as complications in the operating room work to make a mess of the day \u2019 s schedule . also , the operating room is at its cleanest prior to the first operation , a factor for those concerned about the risk of post - operative infection .",

a wrong look or a leer at a girlfriend could lead to a shooting , palmkvist said : <PARA> crime researcher johanna olseryd pointed out that br\u00e5 \u2019 s annual crime survey showed that homicides aren \u2019 t increasing , but they are changing in nature : <PARA> police in malm\u00f6 are currently handling 14 homicides , a number that has overwhelmed local investigators , said erik jans\u00e5ker , police chief for malm\u00f6 \u2019 s southern areas . one of the most rattling of the recent deaths was that of 16 - year - old immigrant ahmed obaid , himself an immigrant . no one knows for certain why he was targeted in roseng\u00e5rd while standing by a bus stop . a bouquet of yellow flowers still rested against a light pole at the bus stop on 16 march 2017 , two months after his shooting . <PARA> officer johannes schultz , who patrols the neighborhood on foot , told us that obaid \u2019 s shooting death sent a chill through the community : <PARA> karlsson said that while the country \u2019 s crime is historically low he can understand the fear that the violence can engender , as when it does happen , it tends to be high profile : <PARA> yet , karlsson , said , crime in sweden has been alternately sensationalized and ignored . he told us that both liberals ( who think of sweden as a paradise ) and conservatives ( who say it is overrun with violence ) have both gotten it wrong : <PARA> research from br\u00e5 backs him up \u2014 crime data show a general downward trend since 2005 : <PARA> in this graph from sweden \u2019 s crime study , the dark solid line represents citizens who said they were victims of crime . the dotted line represents people who said someone in their household had been the victim of property crime , while the light solid line represents people who said they were victims of crimes on their person , a broad legal term that can mean anything from homicide to trespassing . br\u00e5 explained that overall , crime figures are trending down :",

care providers to give clinical employees uninterrupted meal and rest breaks during their shifts , except in emergencies . <PARA> more specifically , walsh was speaking in support of amendment 724 , which was put forward by her republican colleague <MASK> sen . curtis king . that amendment would exempt a certain category of hospitals ( critical access hospitals ) from the requirements of the bill . <PARA> critical access hospitals ( cahs ) are smaller , typically rural hospitals with fewer than 25 in - patient beds that are legally designated as cahs by the federal centers for medicare and medicaid services . because they typically serve relatively isolated rural communities , they receive certain financial support and benefits from the federal government in order to ensure their ongoing sustainability . <PARA> walsh supported the proposed exemption of cahs from the meal and rest - break requirements in shb 1155 , arguing that staff there were not typically as busy as their counterparts in other hospitals , and therefore did not require such mandatory regular breaks . in the interest of completeness , here are walsh \u2019 s remarks in full , which can also be watched here ( beginning at around 9 : 10 ): <PARA> in a <MASK> sent to snopes , the washington <MASK> nurses association rejected one of the premises of walsh \u2019 s call for cahs to be exempted from the proposed new requirements , arguing that , far from being in grave financial danger , \u201c the majority of these small , rural hospitals are financially healthy and well equipped to implement shb 1155 \u2019 s patient safety standards ,\u201d adding that : \u201c over the last four years of reports , the total net income ( surplus ) for washington \u2019 s 40 critical access hospitals is $ 208 , 657 , 776 , with an average surplus of $ 5 , 216 , 444 per hospital . <PARA> when one views walsh \u2019 s remarks in their full and proper context , it \u2019 s clear that her \u201c playing cards \u201d comment related specifically to nurses in cahs (\u201c those nurses \u201d). she was not <MASK> that all nurses everywhere spend much of their working days playing cards . <PARA> this is in contrast to the impression created by much of the subsequent coverage of her remarks . for example , nurse . org summarized her remarks as \u201c nurses \u2018 play cards for a considerable amount of the day ,'\u201d without reflecting that walsh was actually describing only a relatively small subcategory of nurses . <PARA> on 19 april , juliana bindas started an online petition on change . org that called for walsh to follow a nurse around during a 12 - hour shift . the text that accompanied the petition ( which had more than 500 , 000 signatures as of 22 april ) also provided a misleading characterization of the senator \u2019 s comments , <MASK> \u201c senator maureen walsh <MASK> that we as nurses mostly spend our 12 hour shifts playing cards .\u201d <PARA> similarly , many online memes and social media responses markedly failed to recognize that walsh \u2019 s remarks had referred to a specific cohort of nurses , and not all nurses in every context . headlines published by major national news outlets including cnn and the hill also failed to reflect the specific context of walsh \u2019 s comments , instead giving the misleading impression she had been talking about all nurses . <PARA> on 20 april , walsh told the tri - city herald newspaper she regretted her comments , saying \u201c i was tired . i said something i wish i hadn \u2019 t .\u201d in a <MASK> provided to the local kepr television <MASK> , the <MASK> senator elaborated further and clarified that her remarks were indeed specifically in reference to nurses at cahs : <PARA> \u201c my mother was [ a registered nurse ] for many years and i have the greatest respect for nurses . the comment made about the ability to play cards was referring to the staff at the very rural and small critical access hospitals who may only serve a handful of patients and [ where ] the staffing mandates are unnecessary .\u201d <PARA> on 16 april , the washington <MASK> senate passed amendment 724 , along with the revised version of shb 1155 , which subsequently included an exemption for cahs . in the house , a different version of the bill had already been passed , meaning the legislation was scheduled for reconciliation between the two chambers , as of 22 april .",

        "text": "found out a couple of things you might be interested in ! based on the above , easter can actually be one day earlier ( march 22 ) but that is pretty rare . <PARA> here \u2018 s the interesting info . this year is the earliest easter any of us will ever see the rest of our lives ! and only the most elderly of our population have ever seen it this early ( 95 years old or above !). and none of us have ever , or will ever , see it a day earlier ! here \u2019 s the facts : <PARA> 1 ) the next time easter will be this early ( march 23 ) will be the year 2228 ( 220 years from now ). the last time it was this early was 1913 ( so if you \u2019 re 95 or older , you are the only ones that were around for that !). <PARA> 2 ) the next time it will be a day earlier , march 22 , will be in the year 2285 ( 277 years from now ). the last time it was on march 22 was 1818 . so , no one alive today has or will ever see it any earlier than this year ! <PARA> <MASK> : how to determine the date of easter , the annual christian celebration of christ \u2019 s resurrection , is something of a mystery to the average person . unlike most other significant dates on the western calendar , which fall either on fixed dates ( e . g ., halloween is always october 31st ) or on easily - reckoned relative calendar days ( e . g ., thanksgiving in the u . s . is the fourth thursday in november ), easter moves around from year to year in order to preserve its relationship to the astronomical phenomena ( i . e ., the season of the year and the phase of the moon ) that would have occurred at the time of the resurrection ( traditionally reckoned as having taken place in 30 a . d .). <PARA> in the modern era , easter sunday generally falls on the sunday following the paschal full moon ( i . e ., the first full moon of spring in the northern hemisphere , or the first full moon occurring after the date of the vernal equinox ). however , since astronomical observations are variable ( e . g ., the date of the full moon can vary <PARA> depending upon the location of the observer ), the date of easter is typically calculated from tables . we \u2019 ll dispense with an explanation of how to perform these calculations ( for the curious , such an explanation can be found here ) in favor of addressing the main points of the example <MASK> above . <PARA> the earliest calendar date on which easter can fall is march 22 , and the latest date is april 25 . easter therefore took place unusually early in 2008 , with its date of occurrence being march 23 . the last time easter fell on so early a date was 1913 , and the next time it will do so will be in the year 2160 ( not 2228 , as <MASK> in the example cited above \u2014 although easter will also fall on march 23 that year , it will not be the next such occurrence ). <PARA> seeing easter fall on the earliest possible date , march 22 , is an experience that has not been , and ( barring some remarkable breakthroughs in longevity ) will not be , witnessed by anyone alive today : it last occurred in the year 1818 , and it will not happen again until 2285 . <PARA> the odds are considerably better for witnessing a late easter . this year easter falls on april 24 , the second latest date on which that holiday can occur . many people are still around from the last time easter fell on april 25 , an event which took place in 1943 , and a good many people here today will likely still be around when easter next falls on april 25 , which will occur in 2038 .",

        "text": "this warning about the potential danger to pets posed by cocoa mulch began appearing in our inbox in may 2003 . <PARA> although there is at least some truth to this one , the dangers it warns about are by now somewhat outdated and exaggerated : most dogs aren \u2019 t really interested in eating cocoa mulch , some brands of that product have been reformulated to reduce or eliminate the potentially dog - dangerous substance it contains ( theobromine ), and we know of only one substantiated case of a pet death caused by ingestion of the substance . <PARA> ( in july 2007 , \u201c moose ,\u201d a 3 - year - old labrador belonging to a minneapolis couple , died after eating cocoa mulch purchased at a local store . his owners had a veterinarian at the university of minnesota perform a necropsy to determine the likely cause of death of their young and previously healthy pet . the vet found cocoa shells in moose \u2019 s stomach and <MASK> of theobromine in the shells .) <PARA> cocoa mulch , made of cacao shells , is popular with gardeners and landscapers for a number of reasons : it has an aromatic scent , it repels garden pests , it retains moisture well , and it has a rich brown color that darkens ( rather than fades ) over time . however , veterinarians have warned pet owners that cacao shells also naturally contain theobromine , the same ingredient that makes chocolate toxic to dogs : <PARA> the american society for the prevention of cruelty to animals ( aspca ) confirms the potential effects of theobromine and caffeine on dogs : <PARA> according to tables we \u2019 ve examined , cocoa mulch contains 300 - 1200 mg . of theobromine per ounce , making cocoa mulch one of the strongest concentrations of theobromine a pet is likely to encounter in any chocolate product . however , the question of the gravity of the risk presented by this type of gardening mulch remains a matter of debate . according to hershey \u2018 s , for example : <PARA> and some of those who vend cocoa mulch note that although they \u2019 re aware of the pet warnings , they \u2019 ve never encountered a case of a dog \u2019 s being sickened by the product : <PARA> some manufacturers of cocoa mulch ( such as the cocoa mulch brand ) now <MASK> that their products are theobromine - free and pet safe . responsible pet owners should take care in their selection of cocoa mulch brands ; some might prefer to choose another form of soil enhancement for their gardens , such as cedar - based products , rather than gamble their dogs won \u2019 t be attracted to or harmed by cocoa mulch . <PARA> ( although home depot is named as a vendor of cocoa mulch in the example cited at the head of this page , the company told us in may 2006 that : \u201c the home depot does not and will not sell mulch harmful to pets . the mulch sold by the home depot containing cocoa shells goes through several cleaning processes , including a high heat system in order to strip the cocoa fat from the shells without the use of any chemicals .\u201d) <PARA> the danger of canine theobromine poisoning does not begin and end with cocoa mulch , however : chocolate in any form poses substantial risks to some pets . this most beloved of foodstuffs contains theobromine and small amounts of caffeine , both of which can sicken and even kill cats and dogs . <PARA> chocolate \u2019 s toxicity to animals is directly related to three factors : the type of chocolate , the size of the animal , and the amount of chocolate ingested . unsweetened baking chocolate presents the greatest danger to pets because it contains the highest amount of theobromine , approximately 390 - 450 mg . per ounce . white chocolate contains the least . as a general rule of thumb , one ounce of milk chocolate per pound of body weight can be lethal for dogs and cats . ( milk chocolate contains approximately 44 - 66 mg of theobromine per ounce .) <PARA> theobromine affects the heart , central nervous system , and kidneys , causing nausea and vomiting , restlessness , diarrhea , muscle tremors , and increased urination . cardiac arrhythmia and seizures are symptoms of more advanced poisoning . other than induced vomiting , vets have no treatment or antidote for theobromine poisoning . death can occur in 12 to 24 hours . <PARA> this type of poisoning is uncommon because it is rare that a dog , even a small dog , will eat enough chocolate to cause anything more than an upset stomach . yet it can happen , especially if the animal gets into baking chocolate or powdered cocoa , two forms of the sweet particularly loaded with theobromine . <PARA> do not feed chocolate to dogs or cats . if you keep a pet , do not leave chocolate lying about lest your critter help himself to it and in so doing poison himself . if your animal begins exhibiting signs of distress and you believe he might have gotten into some chocolate , call your veterinarian immediately . ( it will help if you can supply information about the approximate weight of your critter , what sort of chocolate was ingested \u2014 white , milk , dark , cocoa powder , baking \u2014 and roughly how much .) but time is of the essence if such a poisoning has indeed taken place , so make the call right away .",

the united <MASK> army followed suit in 2014 . in 2016 , president barack obama signed a bill that amended two specific existing laws by replacing their use of the word ( along with other archaic racial and ethnic categories ) with \u201c african - american .\u201d <PARA> more broadly , though , federal agencies are still technically permitted to use \u201c negro \u201d as a racial category in forms and documents due to a 1997 decision by the clinton white house \u2019 s omb , which set what are known as the standards for the classification of federal data on race and ethnicity : <PARA> the ruling was based on recommendations by a special working committee established by the omb , which had earlier reported that using the category \u201c black or african american \u201d in federal data gathering would cover most individuals in that community , but that \u201c negro \u201d should be allowed to persist as an optional additional category because the term , in their words , \u201c may be favored by older blacks .\u201d the report also concluded : \u201c\u2018 colored \u2019 may be favored by some blacks in the south .\u201d <PARA> although federal agencies are technically allowed to use the word as a racial category in data gathering , we could find no <MASK> that any of them do so . <PARA> the obama administration set up a new committee in 2014 to revisit these standards on racial and ethnic categories in federal data gathering . in september 2016 , the committee recommended removing \u201c negro \u201d from the standards ( along with \u201c far east \u201d), meaning the term would no longer be permitted as a racial category in any federal data gathering . <PARA> the proposals went out for public consultation , and in march 2017 , following the transition to the trump administration , the committee once again proposed removing \u201c negro \u201d from the standards . <PARA> the source of the <MASK> that the trump administration is \u201c considering \u201d the proposals is the fact that the omb has not yet announced its final decision on them . <PARA> npr reported that the decision was not announced when it was expected on 1 december 2017 , and the omb \u2019 s own march 2017 publication had expected it sooner than that , in order to give time for any revisions that might be necessary ahead of the 2020 census . <PARA> we asked the omb to clarify the expected date of their final decision and asked for an explanation of any delay there might have been , but have not yet received a response . <PARA> the apparent delay in issuing a final decision on the omb committee \u2019 s recommendations does not necessarily mean that the trump administration is considering not implementing them . <PARA> there are sometimes delays in final decisions on federal policy proposals and recommendations for innocuous logistical reasons . <PARA> sally katzen , who was centrally involved in the clinton - era changes to racial and ethnic categories as head of the omb \u2019 s office of information and regulatory affairs in 1997 , told npr : \u201c the objective in each instance is to arrive at the right decision , not at any old decision .\u201d <PARA> in this matter , there is no <MASK> that the apparent delay is caused by opposition to ending the use of these racial categories . <PARA> whatever the trump administration might be considering , it is not considering \u201c bringing back \u201d the use of the word as a racial category in federal data gathering , as it is technically already allowed under the clinton administration \u2019 s 1997 decision . what does remain to be seen is whether trump \u2019 s office of management and budget will adopt the proposals of a working group first established by the obama administration and finally put an end to the use of \u201c negro \u201d as a racial category on federal forms .",

        "text": "the following is an excerpt from the july 1943 issue of transportation magazine . this was written for male supervisors of women in the work force during world war ii . <PARA> eleven tips on getting more efficiency out of women employees <PARA> there \u2019 s no longer any question whether transit companies should hire women for jobs formerly held by men . the draft and manpower shortage has settled that point . the important things now are to select the most efficient women available and how to use them to the best advantage . here are eleven helpful tips on the subject from western properties : <PARA> 1 . if you can get them , pick young married women . they have these advantages , according to the reports of western companies : they usually have more of a sense of responsibility than do their unmarried sisters ; they \u2019 re less likely to be flirtatious ; as a rule , they need the work or they wouldn \u2019 t be doing it \u2014 maybe a sick husband or one who \u2019 s in the army ; they still have the pep and interest to work hard and to deal with the public efficiently . <PARA> 2 . when you have to use older women , try to get ones who have worked outside the home at some time in their lives . most transportation companies have found that older women who have never contacted the public , have a hard time adapting themselves , are inclined to be cantankerous and fussy . it \u2019 s always well to impress upon older women the importance of friendliness and courtesy . <PARA> 3 . while there are exceptions , of course , to this rule , general experience indicates that \u201c husky \u201d girls \u2014 those who are just a little on the heavy side \u2014 are likely to be more even - tempered and efficient than their underweight sisters . <PARA> 4 . retain a physician to give each woman you hire a special physical examination \u2014 one covering female conditions . this step not only protects the property against the possibilities of lawsuit but also reveals whether the employee - to - be has any female weaknesses which would make her mentally or physically unfit for the job . transit companies that follow this practice report a surprising number of women turned down for nervous disorders . <PARA> 5 . in breaking in women who haven \u2019 t previously done outside work , stress at the outset the importance of time \u2014 the fact that a minute or two lost here and there makes serious inroads on schedules . until this point is gotten across , service is likely to be slowed up . <PARA> 6 . give the female employe in garage or office a definite day - long schedule of duties so that she \u2019 ll keep busy without bothering the management for instructions every few <MORE> <PARA> 7 . whenever possible , let the inside employe change from one job to another at some time during the day . women are inclined to be nervous and they \u2019 re happier with change . <PARA> 8 . give every girl an adequate number of rest periods during the day . companies that are already using large numbers of women stress the fact that you have to make some allowances for feminine psychology . a girl has more confidence and consequently is more efficient if she can keep her hair tidied , apply fresh lipstick and wash her hands several times a day . <PARA> 9 . be tactful in issuing instructions or in making criticisms . women are often sensitive ; they can \u2019 t shrug off harsh words the way that men do . never ridicule a woman \u2014 it breaks her spirit and cuts her efficiency . <PARA> 10 . be reasonably considerate about using strong language around women . even though a girl \u2019 s husband or father may swear vociferously , she \u2019 ll grow to dislike a place of business where she hears too much of this . <PARA> 11 . get enough size variety in operator uniforms that each girl can have a proper fit . this point can \u2019 t be stressed too strongly as a means of keeping women happy , according to western properties . <PARA> <MASK> : we \u2019 ve seen so many modern day forgeries of texts intended to remind us how cruelly we once treated other human beings ( slave consultant \u2019 s narrative ), remind us how much more <PARA> difficult life used to be ( 1872 rules for teachers ), or poke fun at earlier societal attitudes ( advice to young brides ) that we now naturally assume any such document to be phony until proved real . <PARA> the text <MASK> above is one such example . although we know full well in the 1940s women in the workplace were often patronized , insulted , harassed , and treated as second - class employees in ways almost no one would find acceptable today , we have a hard time believing that even if we once held the attitudes that promoted this type of work environment , no one ( even way back in 1943 ) could have been so crass to <MASK> them as baldly and condescendingly as in the <MASK> cited here . <PARA> however , this is a case in which , whatever experience might tell us , we can set our doubts aside , as the <MASK> <MASK> above is indeed real . it was written by one l . h . sanders and appeared under the title \u201c eleven tips on getting more efficiency out of women employes \u201d in the july 1943 edition of mass transportation magazine . <PARA> use the links below to view scanned images of the magazine \u2019 s cover and <MASK> pages .",

mail server controversy , and launched a dispute over whether it was <MASK> american service members had been prosecuted for similar actions : <PARA> among the individuals citing saucier \u2019 s conviction in response to the dispute was kathleen saucier , the serviceman \u2019 s mother . saucier published a facebook post to a conservative blog \u2019 s page objecting to kaine \u2019 s denial that hillary clinton \u2019 s handling of classified e - mail would have resulted in a court martial if she were a member of the military : <PARA> on 6 october 2016 , kathleen saucier also appeared on fox news to discuss her frustration about the debate segment : <PARA> kristian saucier \u2019 s legal troubles began well prior to clinton \u2019 s e - mail scandal , when photographs on a phone he at one point possessed were discovered by a landfill supervisor and shown to a friend of his in the navy . according to the navy times , saucier was arrested 28 may 2015 on charges \u201c he took and retained pictures of classified spaces and knowingly destroyed <MASK> to disrupt an ongoing investigation .\u201d early reports indicated saucier \u2019 s intent in taking the photographs was a central concern of prosecutors , and saucier was one of several sailors alleged to have violated a then - new ban on personal devices in classified spaces : <PARA> investigators considered an intent of espionage , a charge saucier \u2019 s lawyers strongly contested . the federal bureau of investigation ( fbi ) further alleged saucier had destroyed <MASK> in order to avoid prosecution , but the bureau did not present any <MASK> he had attempted to disseminate the photographs ( all captured while he was on duty ) of classified equipment or spaces : <PARA> three witnesses attested to knowledge of saucier \u2019 s possession of the images , and the fbi alleged saucier attempted to destroy the <MASK> that he had taken them : <PARA> at the time of that report , the case was still in its exploratory phases . on 27 may 2016 , the department of justice ( doj ) issued a press release <MASK> that saucier had pled guilty to one count of unauthorized possession and retention of classified material . espionage was not mentioned as an element of his plea , and saucier was not court - martialed : <PARA> the debate didn \u2019 t mark the first instance of kristian saucier \u2019 s charges and conviction being compared to clinton \u2019 s private e - mail server investigation . at saucier \u2019 s august 2016 sentencing hearing , his lawyers argued for a sentence of probation and maintained that clinton \u2019 s contemporaneous fbi investigation and the bureau \u2019 s ultimate decision not to indict her ought to be taken into account . prosecutors argued the defense was \u201c grasping ... at straws \u201d in drawing a comparison to clinton , as well as to other sailors of similar rank punished less severely for taking photographs on the ship . saucier \u2019 s attorneys pointed to uneven prosecution of offenses relating to classified information and cited specifics of the clinton e - mail investigation , while several witnesses asserted saucier was definitely aware his actions constituted a serious offense : <PARA> although director of the undersea warfare division for the chief of naval operations rear admiral charles richard argued on behalf of the navy for a severe sentence in a victim impact <MASK> , the prosecution was impeded by the low level of classification of the photographs : <PARA> on 19 august 2016 , saucier was sentenced to one year in prison , six months of home confinement , and fined $ 100 , far less than the six - year sentence the prosecution sought . saucier \u2019 s attorney surmised that the clinton investigation may have influenced the lighter sentence , and saucier \u2019 s shipmates urged the judge to consider varying penalties applied for similar behavior : <PARA> both kristian saucier and hillary clinton were federally investigated over alleged mishandling of classified information : saucier was charged and sentenced to prison , while clinton was controversially not indicted by the doj after a lengthy investigation . shipmates of saucier and some members of the public have contrasted the cases to suggest that saucier faced harsher penalties for a lesser offense , but intent was the core of the fbi \u2019 s recommendation not to indict clinton , while several witnesses testified that saucier was fully aware his actions were prohibited . <PARA> kristian saucier was pardoned by president donald trump in march 2018 . in june 2018 , his lawyer announced that saucier intended to file a lawsuit against obama administration officials , alleging that he was subject to unequal protection of the law .",

what they depict hasn \u2019 t yet been built , may never be built , and hasn \u2019 t yet been demonstrated to be technically feasible . they come from the web site of rafaa , a zurich - based architecture and design studio , which submitted them in 2009 as its proposal for a design competition . rafaa described the concept behind its \u201c solar city tower \u201d design thusly : <PARA> the aim of this project is to ask how the classic concept of a landmark can be reconsidered . it is less about an expressive , iconic architectural form ; rather , it is a return to content and actual , real challenges for the imminent post - oil - era . this project represents a message of a society facing the future ; thus , it is the representation of an inner attitude . our project , standing in the tradition of \u201c a <MORE> directly from the foyer . its inner circulation is organised by an own entrance and the elevator . the semi - public spaces are located in the back area of the building ; thus , they can be used separately . a retractable platform for bungee jumping is located on level + 90 . 5 . long distance observation can be done from the observation deck on level + 98 . 0 . the urban balcony is situated at the top of the tower 105 meters above sea level . here the visitor has a 360 \u00b0 view of the landscape and can experience the waterfall while walking over the glass sky walk . <PARA> the project consists of a solar power plant that by day produces energy for the city respectively the olympic village . excessive energy will be pumped as seawater <PARA> into a tower . by night , the water can be released again ; with the help of turbines , it generates electricity for the night . the electricity produced can be used for the lighting of the tower or for the city . on special occasions , this \u201c machine building \u201d turns into an impressive wonder of nature : an urban waterfall , a symbol for the forces of nature . at the same time , it will be the representation of a collective awareness of the city towards its great surrounding landscape . via an urban plaza located 60 meters over sea level you gain access to the building . through the amphitheater , you reach the entrance situated on the ground floor . <PARA> both entrance area and amphitheatre can serve as a place for social gatherings and events . the public spaces are also accessible from this point on . the cafeteria and the shop are situated beneath the waterfall and offer a breathtaking view . the public elevator takes the visitor to the observation decks and the urban balcony . the administration offices can be reached directly from the foyer . its inner circulation is organised by an own entrance and the elevator . the semi - public spaces are located in the back area of the building ; thus , they can be used separately . a retractable platform for bungee jumping is located on level + 90 . 5 . long distance observation can be done from the observation deck on level + 98 . 0 . the urban balcony is situated at the top of the tower 105 meters above sea level . here the visitor has a 360 \u00b0 view of the landscape and can experience the waterfall while walking over the glass sky walk . <PARA> given that the 2016 summer olympics are little more than a year away , and rafaa still says they have \u201c no news at the moment \u201d to report , it \u2019 s exceedingly unlikely that visitors to rio 2016 will be greeted by a solar city tower .",

he then recanted his confession , hinted at a conspiracy , and sought to withdraw his guilty plea and secure a trial . however , any <MASK> made by ray about his guilt or innocence should be weighed against his strong incentive to be freed from prison ( where he died in 1998 ). <PARA> also at issue is the difference between ray \u2019 s guilty plea in 1969 , which avoided his undergoing a criminal trial , and the case cited by the <MASK> , which was a civil trial heard in 1999 . the latter ( king vs . jowers ) was a civil suit brought by agents of king \u2019 s <MASK> ( including his widow , coretta scott king ) against a man named loyd jowers , who <MASK> to have taken part in a conspiracy to assassinate king . in a criminal trial the guilt of the defendant must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt , but in a civil suit the plaintiff need only support his <MASK> with a preponderance of <MASK> to prevail . <PARA> loyd jowers was a memphis restaurant owner who inserted himself into the narrative about king \u2019 s death in the course of a 1993 television interview during which he <MASK> to have <MORE> new york times \u2018 report of the verdict , the one - sided presentation of the case allowed for no other result : <PARA> the justice department also found the <MASK> presented in the civil trial to be lacking in credibility : <PARA> all of this is therefore a very slender thread on which to hang the <MASK> that the \u201c u . s . government was proved responsible for king \u2019 s assassination .\u201d ( in the event , the verdict referred only to \u201c governmental agencies \u201d rather than the u . s . government specifically , a term that could include anything from local police to the cia .) and contrary to the <MASK> \u2019 s assertion , the 1999 civil case involving jowers was widely reported by major news outlets at the time ( including , as referenced above , the new york times ). <PARA> more to the point , however , jowers ( who didn \u2019 t even testify ) was the only named party in the civil suit brought by the king family , and the judgment awarded in that case was a paltry $ 100 , widely described as a token award to mark the trial \u2019 s outcome . no other parties ( including any branches or agents of the united <MASK> government ) were named as defendants in king v . jowers , and no identification was provided by jowers of the purported other parties with whom he colluded to assassinate king . by all accounts , the two main parties involved , the king family and jowers , had disparate goals served by the civil suit \u2019 s outcome ; and no substantive <MASK> was presented to establish any of the <MASK> made by jowers had any merit . <PARA> in a <MASK> about the 1999 civil suit , coretta scott king cited several unrelated and unspecified agents in her description of the parties she believed were responsible for her husband \u2019 s murder : <PARA> the one thing the conspiracy <MASK> correctly <MASK> is a 1999 civil trial reached a verdict that cited the existence of a conspiracy to assassinate martin luther king , jr . what it neglects to mention is the relative worth of such a judgment : the verdict in question was civil rather than criminal , the sole named defendant was someone who stood to gain both publicity and money from repeating his <MASK> , and the king family \u2019 s motivation in bringing the suit was to validate their long - held suspicions a larger conspiracy was at play in the death of the civil rights leader . given the minor sum of money awarded , a jury would have little incentive to not find in favor of an account supported by both sides of a flawed case . <PARA> the u . s . justice department concluded in june 2000 the \u201c allegations <MASK> with loyd jowers ... are not credible \u201d:",

[ who ] were inside the vehicle during both armed robberies .\u201d the children were aged two and five years old . <PARA> conclusion <PARA> whether the discrepancies between the cases of legleitner and lloyd amounted to \u201c monumental factual differences ,\u201d as the 12th judicial circuit described them , is ultimately a matter of opinion , as is the question of whether those factual differences warranted such vastly different sentences . <PARA> however , it cannot be disputed that significant differences existed between the two cases which went beyond the race of the defendants , and in giving legleitner a relatively lenient sentence , judge bauer followed the recommendations of both the defense attorney and the prosecutor , and he fulfilled his obligations by citing the reasons for that lighter sentence .",

        "text": "in august 2017 , several news outlets reported that public health authorities in the <MASK> of iowa had advised against serving certain alcoholic drinks in copper mugs : <PARA> iowa \u2019 s alcoholic beverages division did indeed publish an advisory bulletin on 28 july 2017 : <PARA> the bulletin goes on to explain that the food and drug administration food code prohibits food or drink with ph levels of below 6 ( that is , relatively acidic food and drinks ) coming in contact with copper at a licensed premises like a bar or restaurant . the reasoning behind this , according to page 485 of the fda food code , is that there is a slight but definite risk of poisoning : <PARA> the fda code adds that anyone serving beverages ( including water ) through pipes must also have adequate mechanisms in place to prevent copper from leaching into drinks . it also points out that while copper is an important part of the fermentation required to brew beer , too much copper ( above 0 . 2 mg per liter ) kills yeast , so the level of copper leached into successfully - brewed beer falls below what is toxic to humans ( about 3 . 5 mg per liter and above ). <PARA> the 28 july 2017 <MASK> by the iowa alcoholic beverages division does not contain new information , new research , or a new warning about drinking from copper mugs . it is effectively a reminder , in light of the recent popularity of the moscow mule , that iowa has incorporated the federal regulations contained in the fda food code . that code has contained the same restrictions on copper plumbing and containers , and the same rationale , since at least 1997 . <PARA> it \u2019 s clear that although copper is an important naturally occurring trace element , it can also be toxic to humans . it is also clear that toxic levels of copper can leach into food and water through both copper containers ( such as those used for acidic drinks like the moscow mule and other beverages ) and through copper or copper alloy plumbing . <PARA> however , what \u2019 s less clear is how much copper is enough to make you sick , and how likely it is that you \u2019 ll be harmed by drinking a cocktail from a copper mug . <PARA> in 1991 , the environmental protection agency established a \u201c maximum contaminant level goal \u201d for copper of 1 . 3 mg per liter of fluid ( page 130 ). according to the epa , the mclg is \u201c the maximum level of a contaminant in drinking water at which no known or anticipated adverse effect on the health of persons would occur , allowing an adequate margin of safety \u201d. a 1999 study in the journal environmental health perspectives concluded that copper levels above 3 mg per liter of drinking water <MORE> replied : <PARA> solioz emphasized that while the risk from typical consumption is probably low for most people , a small proportion of the population ( around 1 in 30 , 000 people ) have wilson disease , which causes an accumulation of copper within the body , and could potentially be harmed by consuming acidic beverages from a copper container . <PARA> while most people are able to effectively secrete copper , solioz said , those with wilson disease struggle to do this , so even the relatively low level of copper leached into a drink could make them sick . <PARA> solioz told us he was unaware of any research which specifically measured the rate of copper leaching in containers carrying beverages of various acidities , and over various time periods . we were also unable to find such research . <PARA> the closest thing to this that we could find was a short 1957 report published in the american journal of public health . this report described an outbreak of nausea , vomiting and diarrhea among nurses at a military hospital in 1954 . the nurses consumed cocktails at a party that had been sitting in copper - contaminated cocktail shakers for more than two hours before many of them became sick . dr john wylie , the report \u2019 s author , wrote : <PARA> the cocktail was reconstructed , yielding the equivalent of 179 mg of copper per liter . wylie concluded : <PARA> it \u2019 s very difficult to conclude anything from this about the rate at which cocktails might typically become contaminated in copper containers : this was a short and decades - old case report , not a scientific study ( which could have controlled for various possible causal factors ); the author does not make it clear whether he himself was present for the incident ; and wylie also suggests that the level of copper leaching in the cocktail was linked to significant damage to the container . despite these serious shortcomings , the 1957 report formed the basis of the epa \u2019 s 1991 decision that the \u201c maximum contaminant level goal \u201d for copper in drinking water should be 1 . 3 mg per liter . this recommendation remains in place in august 2017 . <PARA> we also asked iowa \u2019 s department of inspections and appeals for <MASK> on reports of copper poisoning in the <MASK> , in order to see whether there had been a spike in symptoms accompanying the increased popularity of the moscow mule , but we were told that the <MASK> \u2019 s department of public health does not track such reports . <PARA> iowa \u2019 s alcoholic beverages division , meanwhile , recommends that if bar and restaurant owners are going to use copper mugs for highly - acidic drinks like the moscow mule , they should use copper mugs lined on the inside with other metals like nickel or stainless steel .",

1960s . <PARA> without a doubt , the central idea underlying all versions of the restroom legends is a racist or otherwise prejudiced one : certain \u201c other \u201d people \u2014 members of a feared minority \u2014 are out to get \u201c our \u201d children . <PARA> \u201c blood simple \u201d legends about feared minorities torturing and murdering helpless tots as part of their religious rituals have shifted from one group to another as the balance of who was in the minority and who was in the majority changed over time . medieval lore is rife with tales about jews using christian children in their presumed diabolical rites , and lore older than <MORE> through a number of communities , prompting various debunkers and police departments to expend great efforts to run it down . it \u2019 s a legend , and nothing more . <PARA> this \u201c mutilated boy \u201d legend shares commonalities with another common urban belief tale , the child kidnapped in an amusement park or store whose appearance is altered in the washroom to facilitate smuggling him out of that venue . that tale too is merely legend , but it is also widely believed . <PARA> on those <MASK> life occasions when a child was picked at random and murdered in a washroom ( which has happened ), it was invariably the work of a monster acting on his own , not the handiwork of a gang out to terrorize another group or to expend a child from another culture in a sick initiation rite . lore and real life part ways at this point , though actual cases involving murdered youngsters and restrooms are often mistakenly pointed to as proving the legend . <PARA> two cases from the 1990s of children murdered in washrooms stick in the mind . <PARA> in may 1997 , 19 -

year - old brother <MASK> her , but soon left her alone again , according to casino officials , and she played in the arcade alone for the next two hours . she was last seen alive at 3 : 45 am when a security camera recorded her entering the washroom where she would be killed . meanwhile , her father occupied himself with slot machines in the casino upstairs . <PARA> in november 1998 , 20 -

( indeed , the version that bestowed a name on the hapless man provided a joke within a joke , as a fictional creature described as a living specimen of the lost brontosaurus and said to wander wild in the jungles of africa has been dubbed the mkele mbembe .) <PARA> as for how old this leg pull is , we spotted it posted to the newsgroup rec . humor . funny in march 1995 : <PARA> yet the gag is even older than that , as this excerpt from the 1977 children \u2019 s book the turbulent term of tyke tiler shows : <PARA> certain of the <MASK> \u2019 s elements work to conceal the nature of the tale from those who might otherwise easily spot it for the put - on it is . while lore has it that elephants have fantastic memories , the truth about their mental capabilities is far removed from that . however , because we have been exposed to it so often , the precept \u201c an elephant never forgets \u201d stays lodged in the backs of our minds , in this case working to \u2018 confirm \u2019 the basic point of the fiction : that it was reasonable for the doomed man to assume an elephant he \u2019 d had a brief interaction with 20 years earlier would remember him . second , in recent years there have been a number of horrific maulings of zoo visitors who were fool enough to enter animal enclosures because they believed they had established spiritual connections with the beasts inside and so would be greeted as long - lost friends . memories of news accounts about those real incidents also work to shore up the surface plausibility of this yarn .",

        "text": "salt lamps , which are merely light bulbs of varying wattages placed within blocks of rock salt of varying sizes , have become an increasingly popular product in the alternative medicine scene and are marketed as \u201c natural ionizers .\u201d an ionizer , in theory , produces ions , which are atoms or molecules with a net positive or negative charge caused by an uneven number of protons to electrons . <PARA> according a popular ( and representative ) facebook post about salt lamps , the product can positively affect your health in these diverse ways : <PARA> all the <MASK> described above rely on the singularly <MASK> assertion that a block of salt with a light bulb inserted inside will naturally emit negative ions . that argument , when intelligible , usually invokes some sort of interplay between the salt , which attracts water from the air , and the heat from the light evaporating that water , as described in a non - peer - reviewed 2010 paper in the pakistan journal of molecular biology : <PARA> this explanation has the great benefit of sounding scientific . who really knows how ions are formed in the first place or what will happen to blocks of heated salt rock , anyway ? one person with pretty deep knowledge on the topic is caltech professor of chemistry jack beauchamp , an expert in ( among other things ) the myriad processes that generate ions and the analytical methods used to detect those ions . <PARA> beauchamp was skeptical that a heated block of sodium chloride would produce ions ( any amount of them , positive or negative ones , let alone \u201c boundless amounts \u201d) but not so skeptical that he didn \u2019 t want to hook up the most popular salt lamp available from amazon . com to his lab \u2019 s quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer . this instrument , in essence , sucks in air from directly around the solid and analyzes the mass and charge of <MASK> captured by the instrument . here \u2019 s beauchamp description of what he did in his own words : <PARA> the structure aspect is important , says beauchamp . one way to get crystals to generate ions is to alter the shape of its crystal structure via temperature , something that can happen if a crystal structure is asymmetric . he points to a crystal called lithium tantalate , which changes its crystal structure when heated up in such a way as to create areas of high and low electrical potential when heated or cooled . this property allows it to generate an electric field that could , in theory , ionize the air around it . sodium chloride \u2019 s chemical structure is a symmetrical cube that does not have the capability to generate high electric fields in the vicinity of a crystal . <PARA> the bottom line , according to beauchamp and other chemists , is that <MORE> air . <PARA> a block of sodium chloride , which , again , does not produce any ions , does not have any mechanism for the flow of air or the trapping of the <MASK> in that air , and would therefore be useless as an air filtration system . this is , incidentally , why the sharper image ionic breeze line of products , despite actually producing ions , is complete bunk . <PARA> this <MASK> has existed sporadically in the scientific literature for decades , but ultimately is not supported by current science . a 2013 review of psychological effects attributed to air ions , which looked at 33 studies from 1957 to 2012 evaluating \u201c the effects of air ionization on depression , anxiety , mood <MASK> , and subjective feelings of mental well - being \u201d, concluded : <PARA> this <MASK> stems from research performed on laboratory rats who were under anesthesia and essentially pumped directly with high concentrations of negatively ionized air . it goes without saying that humans are not rats , and a that specifically designed laboratory ionization instruments produce a whole lot more ions than a salt lamp , which , not to drive this point home too much , they do not . <PARA> this assertion is perplexing because it is a ) unclear where that number comes from , b ) which ones they are , or c ) how these trace minerals would be released from the salt in a lamp and transported into your body . <PARA> it seems likely that the number and associated health <MASK> comes from a page on dr . mercola \u2019 s online store in which he is selling his own brand of himalayan salt ( supplies are limited !) ironically , mercola <MASK> himalayan salt to be \u201c the most pure \u201d while simultaneously suggesting its health benefits come from its impurities : <PARA> needless to say , the <MASK> listed on an advertisement for a product cannot be taken as peer - reviewed science . not that you need to even look that far . <PARA> this advertisement is for salt to cook with , which would provide a much more plausible route for those trace minerals to get into your body . unless you are licking your salt lamp , however , the only thing those impurities might do is impart its nice pinkish color . <PARA> incidentally , that nice pinkish color that glows once the bulb is turned on is the only thing you are going to get from a salt lamp . salt lamps may look neat , but <MASK> that they can do anything medically rely \u2014 fatally \u2014 on the <MASK> that the lamps produce negative ions and then further rely on a series gross simplifications or misinterpretations of science to argue that those negative ions ( which don \u2019 t exist in the first place ) could affect you in any meaningful way .",

( we were unable to locate the document anywhere other than wikileaks , and bassone told us that slides from the fbi \u2019 s release later appeared on an episode of law and order : special victims unit .) the communication tipped law enforcement in 2007 to the existence of the symbols and common applications among pedophiles : <PARA> the application of such symbols was again described in a separate portion of the release : <PARA> the document described the symbols as used by pedophiles to denote their own preferences , not ones reserved to mark children as potential or available victims . a later portion read : <PARA> the release was available in full online [ pdf ], complete with photographs of the symbols : <PARA> the symbol on the plush monster truck was similar : <PARA> it was also similar to the logo of popular surf brand roxy , which features a large line of clothing for young children and tweens : <PARA> bassone told us that the use of interlocking hearts in and of itself was unlikely to put any child in danger , adding that the department was attempting to talk to the designer to learn more about the choice of symbol . <PARA> however , he explained that the appearance of the symbol on children \u2019 s items was off - putting from the perspective of a cyber crimes detective , as they may be widely recognized by pedophiles . bassone noted that while the symbol wasn \u2019 t necessarily dangerous or presenting a risk of child exploitation , it was possible in - the - know pedophiles would find the use of the symbol on children \u2019 s clothing or toys to be stimulating or amusing . <PARA> feld inc . responded to our inquiry , confirming that the item was since pulled from their inventory . spokesman stephen payne said in a <MASK> that the company was unaware the heart symbol bore any relation to pedophile shibboleths . the tenor of the <MASK> suggested that the maker of the toy was genuinely horrified to learn of the <MASK> and took immediate action upon hearing the <MASK> : <PARA> it \u2019 s <MASK> that a toy sold at monster jam bore a symbol similar to one used by pedophiles , and that toy has since been pulled from the event \u2019 s merchandise inventory . however , that symbol was not exclusive to pedophiles and did not \u201c mark \u201d children for abuse . feld inc . asserted that they were unaware of the connection , but immediately acted to remove the toys from circulation . after this post was published , a number of readers pointed out a very similar and widely distributed unilever - brand ice cream logo : <PARA> urban legends about use of symbols in crime are rife , as they enable people to feel one step ahead of crafty criminals . perennially popular warnings about robbery and dog theft were very similar to the pedophile code <MASK> . but it \u2019 s worth keeping in mind that studies have consistently demonstrated strangers pose a far smaller risk than individuals close to a child , such as a relative or a friend of the family . only 10 percent [ pdf ] of assaults were committed by a stranger , a number reiterated by the united <MASK> department of justice . the bulk [ pdf ] of abuse is committed by family members , family friends , or other trusted adults without the use of coded toys .",

( these vapors eventually escape as the tissue containing them breaks down , allowing them to leak from the body .) <PARA> sometimes variations encountered by our readers served to add to the basic <MASK> , as in this telling : <PARA> [ collected via e - mail , 2003 ] <PARA> i was dating a guy in the military who told me this <MASK> about dog tags . he said that if a soldier was killed in the field , his surviving comrade was to take one of the dog tags , break it in half , and close the dead soldier \u2019 s jaw firmly over one of the halves it to keep it in place for identification purposes in case the body was found . he also said that the ball chain that holds the tags is comprised of 365 beads , and the smaller loop that goes through the tags is comprised of 52 beads . if a soldier is taken prisoner , he can detach the beads as a means of keeping track of how many days have passed . <PARA> i was dating a guy in the military who told me this <MASK> about dog tags . he said that if a soldier was killed in the field , his surviving comrade was to take one of the dog tags , break it in half , and close the dead soldier \u2019 s jaw firmly over one of the halves it to keep it in place for identification purposes in case the body was found . he also said that the ball chain that holds the tags is comprised of 365 beads , and the smaller loop that goes through the tags is comprised of 52 beads . if a soldier is taken prisoner , he can detach the beads as a means of keeping track of how many days have passed . <PARA> the chain upon which dog tags are hung wasn \u2019 t always beaded . at one time olive drab cord or cloth tape was the norm , and woven nylon , wire , and cloth cords still show up as alternatives to the now ubiquitous string of metal beads . even the <MASK> metal chain issued in 1943 had flat links , not the rounded beads of the rosary explanation . the smaller loop of chain was there to keep the tags separated from each other so their clinking didn \u2019 t alert unfriendlies to the presence of u . s . troops , a function now primarily served by rubber gaskets ( known as \u201c silencers \u201d) placed around the edge of each tag . <PARA> barbara \u201c chain ganged \u201d mikkelson",

        "text": "on 24 october 2016 , health insurance broker tyler mcclosky created a phenomenon on facebook when he posted a screen shot of what it would cost for a family of four with a total household income of $ 98 , 000 in lee county , florida , to buy insurance on the affordable care act \u2019 s marketplace : <PARA> we were able to recreate mcclosky \u2019 s viral post using the shopping tool at healthcare . gov and the same data he entered ( two non - smoking parents with a combined income of $ 98 , 000 and two 8 - year - old children in lee county , florida ): <PARA> but data sent by a department of health and human services official pointed out that 81 percent of families of that size on an obamacare plan have household incomes of less than $ 48 , 000 . so the average family currently subscribing to obamacare would not be paying nearly as much as the image above depicts in their out - of - pocket premium costs . we entered the same data but changed the income to $ 48 , 000 here : <PARA> mcclosky created the post on 24 october 2016 , the same day a report by the department of health and human services was released detailing an average 25 percent increase in costs to the affordable care act ( obamacare ) customers : <PARA> this figure varies based on locale . for instance , a table compiled by the kaiser family foundation shows that people in phoenix , arizona will have a 145 percent premium increase , but a tax subsidy will mean a 40 - year - old , non - smoking phoenix resident with a $ 30 , 000 annual income will not have to pay any more than last year ( which is roughly $ 207 a month , depending on the plan selected ). <PARA> according to data sent by the department of health and human services ( hhs ), a majority of consumers covered by the aca ( 85 percent ) qualify for tax credits that keep pace with premium increases , so many won \u2019 t see much of an impact on their out - of - pocket costs . <PARA> but mcclosky was addressing people whose income disqualifies them from that assistance . he told us he used the $ 98 , 000 annual income as an example because that is the threshold at which households of four with two children do not qualify for tax credit assistance ( you qualify if you make up to 400 percent of the federal poverty line ). he said he created the post because he wanted to raise awareness about what it costs to insure a family in which each adult is making an annual salary of $ 44 , 000 , and neither has access to employer - based health care \u2014 a fairly common situation in the united <MASK> . <PARA> his concern , he said , is that only consumers who qualify for a tax subsidy can afford insurance under aca . if their incomes are too high to qualify for assistance , they may simply go without . while the number of uninsured americans dropped under aca , as of 2015 , 28 . 5 million people still lack coverage . per the kaiser family foundation : <PARA> eric seiber , associate professor of health services management and policy at ohio <MASK> , said that the health care system in the united <MASK> is the most expensive in the world , and costs have steadily increased over the years . despite its name , the affordable care act doesn \u2019 t actually address the cost of health care itself : <PARA> people \u2019 s perception that their wages have been flat is an effect of compensation increases going to cover rising healthcare costs instead of into their paychecks , seiber said . <PARA> mcclosky , who sells health and life insurance plans in florida , said that the affordable care act has had the effect of diminishing competition among carriers . for instance , lee county residents can only purchase blue cross blue shield . prices in miami - dade are lower than in lee county , because there are more carriers competing with each other . <PARA> mcclosky says insurance carriers have been squeezed by part of the mandate which requires them to spend 80 to 85 percent on <MASK> payouts and health care quality improvement . he pointed to assurant , a 123 - yea - old insurer that specialized in individual and small business plans . they could not survive under the aca and filed for bankruptcy in 2015 . <PARA> health care is a source of roiling political debate for years . while the cost of health plans under obamacare will go up an average 25 percent as of 1 november 2016 , the majority of consumers won \u2019 t experience much change in their out - of - pocket costs when open enrollment starts for 2017 , because the tax credits will buffer that increase . further , as the new york times pointed out , many americans are shielded from the immediate costs of health care by employer - based insurance or the public programs : <PARA> however , as mcclosky \u2019 s post makes clear , whether people notice it or not , american health care costs are high \u2014 and not everyone can qualify for available assistance .",

( this is especially <MASK> when companies advertise cut - off dates for their charity programs or emblazon their product packaging with promotional announcements \u2014 even though the contribution targets may have long since been met , the fact that the cut - off dates are still in the future or products with promotional packaging are still on shore shelves can mislead consumers into believing that the charity campaigns are on - going , even after those campaigns have effectively ended .) a 75 , 000 - click goal , like the one 3m set in their july 2004 announcement of this promotion , is one easily met within the first few days ( although the 3m campaign officially runs until 15 september 2004 ). <PARA> we don \u2019 t mean to dissuade anyone from participating in 3m \u2019 s program to support the city of hope , or to suggest that 3m is doing anything less than donating money to a good cause . readers might want to know that their participation in such promotions is generally symbolic rather than functional , though . <PARA> update : on 31 august 2004 , 3m announced it had already met its target of 75 , 000 sign - ups : <PARA> we \u2019 ve reached our goal <PARA> thank you for sticking up for breast cancer research with us . the office supplies division of 3m is pleased to announce that because of the large response we have already reached our goal for the world \u2019 s largest pink ribbon . <PARA> thank you for sticking up for breast cancer research with us . the office supplies division of 3m is pleased to announce that because of the large response we have already reached our goal for the world \u2019 s largest pink ribbon .",

        "text": "on 6 february 2017 , the pro - life website life news published an <MASK> headlined \u201c oregon bill would allow starving mentally ill patients to death .\u201d that <MASK> , consisting primarily of a press release from the oregon right to life group , reported on oregon senate bill 494 , which proposed changes to that <MASK> \u2019 s advance directive legislation . ( advanced directives are legal documents used to appoint an official representative to make health decisions in the event someone becomes incapacitated .) <PARA> the life news <MASK> is out of date , as a different version of the same legislation , house bill 4135 , was signed into law on 16 march 2018 . the primary purpose behind both pieces of legislation was the simplification and clarification of the form used to create advance directives . the advance directive debate in 2018 was indeed controversial , and the passage of house bill 4135 took place along party lines , but those debates were largely about how much power to give the committee charged with creating the new form and not about the cessation of life support . <PARA> most opponents of hb 4135 , such as republican <MASK> sen . dennis linthicum , agreed in general with the direction of the bill but expressed concern that the legislation \u2019 s wording gave \u201c the committee too much power and provides the legislature too little oversight .\u201d <PARA> according to the <MASK> - general , \u201c lawmakers on both sides agreed the current form [ was ] in dire need of improvement ,\u201d primarily owing to its overly complicated or vague wording . in a broad sense the bill made two substantive changes to existing advance directive laws , which were first passed in 1993 and had not been modified until 2018 , as described by the corvallis gazette - times : <PARA> in oregon , this area of legislation frequently intersects with concerns raised by pro - life groups that typically focus on the rights of the unborn . that \u2019 s because advance directives can include directions and preferences on receiving ( or declining ) life - sustaining treatments under certain circumstances . in their <MASK> , life news attempted to draw a connection between this proposed legislation and oregon \u2019 s 1997 death with dignity act , implying the new law represented a step toward forced euthanasia via the cessation of life support or artificial feeding of persons medically incapable of making medical decisions for themselves : <PARA> this is a bad - faith argument . while certain circumstances exist in which it would be legal in oregon to cease providing tube - feeding or other life support to mentally incapacitated individuals who left no advance directive and whose next of kin or legal representatives could not be located , such a scenario existed in oregon <MASK> law before house bill 4135 . and the plausibility of that scenario remained largely unchanged following <MORE> 635 <MASK> that \u201c life - sustaining procedures that would otherwise be applied to a principal who is incapable and who does not have an appointed health care representative or applicable valid advance directive may be withheld or withdrawn ... if the principal has been medically confirmed to be in one of the following conditions : <PARA> the notion that the bill would \u201c allow for the starving of patients with dementia or mental illness \u201d comes from the subsequent portions of ors 127 . 635 , which touch on scenarios under which an \u201c incapable \u201d adult meets the above conditions and has no appointed healthcare representative , next of kin , or advance directive under oregon law : <PARA> this section <MASK> that if a mentally incapable person meets the criteria described in all the excerpts above , but that person does not have an advance directive or appointed health care representative , the de facto representative shall be drawn from a specific list of people ranging from an authorized guardian to \u201c any adult relative or adult friend .\u201d if none of these people can be identified , the law <MASK> \u201c then life - sustaining procedures may be withheld or withdrawn upon the direction and under the supervision of the attending physician .\u201d <PARA> as mentioned before , though , the entirety of the oregon law cited above , which could allow for the termination of life support for incapable individuals who met extremely narrow criteria , existed prior to senate bill 494 or house bill 4135 . the legislation signed into law in 2018 did make minor changes to section 127 . 635 of the oregon revised <MASK> , but the substance of these laws remains unchanged . before the passage of house bill 4135 , as well as after , the only situation in which the headline <MASK> that it is legal to \u201c starve mentally ill patients to death \u201d would be <MASK> would be a situation in which : <PARA> a person who suffers from mental illness or dementia may be classified as \u201c incapable ,\u201d but that is not sufficient grounds for terminating life support . this was <MASK> before house bill 4135 , and it remains <MASK> now after that bill was signed into law : that law made no changes to ors 127 . 580 . the most notable change made to 127 . 635 was the addition of a clause after the sentence \u201c life - sustaining procedures may be withheld or withdrawn upon the direction and under the supervision of the attending physician or attending health care provider \u201d ( emphasis ours ). <PARA> because both senate bill 494 or house bill 4135 did not substantively alter the legal requirements for terminating life support in incapable adults , however , we rank as <MASK> the <MASK> that these bills \u2019 purpose was \u201c designed to allow for the starving of patients with dementia or mental illness .\u201d",

( the fifth amendment to the constitution mandates that \u201c private property [ shall not ] be taken for public use , without just compensation .\u201d) thus the idea of enacting eminent domain as a form of debt repayment or guarantee isn \u2019 t logical : it \u2019 s akin to a debtor \u2019 s offering to settle a $ 5 , 000 debt by agreeing to sell his creditor $ 5 , 000 worth of jewelry for $ 5 , 000 \u2014 at the end of the day , the debtor hasn \u2019 t given up anything , and his creditor still hasn \u2019 t collected anything on his <MASK> loan amount . <PARA> moreover , executive order 13406 (\u201c protecting the property rights of the american people \u201d) <MASK> that the the federal government must limit its use of the taking of private property \u201c to situations in which the taking is for public use , with just compensation \u201d and \u201c not merely for the purpose of advancing the economic interest of private parties to be given ownership or use of the property taken .\u201d <PARA> aside from functional arguments , the common sense test applies : if the u . s . government had actually guaranteed , in writing , that china could seize private property within the u . s . to satisfy the financial obligations of the u . s . government , that information would be the biggest new <MASK> of the day . so who is reporting this news ? not any legitimate news outlet \u2014 the <MASK> appears only in the blog of former radio host hal turner ( who has previously presented fictitious tales of politically outrageous subjects as actual occurrences , such as proffering fake amero coins as <MASK> of a secret conspiracy to merge the u . s ., mexico , and canada into a single entity ) and in hundreds of identical internet replications .",

        "text": "employment frauds typically prey upon the gullible or the desperate whose burning desire to secure lucrative work blinds them to the scams about to be run on them . generally , the promise of easy - to - perform labor that pays very well is held out to those disadvantaged in their search for employment by their lack of relevant job experience or education and so appears to be the answer to their prayers . because the need to believe in such fairytale careers runs so strong , ordinary skepticism is temporarily set aside by those bedazzled by such <MASK> promises , and that little nagging \u201c you know better than to be taken in by this \u201d voice is silenced , thereby leaving job seekers vulnerable to being fleeced . <PARA> a common form of the employment swindle is that of the fraudulent secret shopper job posting . such ads tout the ease of the work , the short hours , and the money to be made from merely visiting stores each day to make purchases , even as they stress that no special training or educational background is required of prospective hires . according to such come - ons , successful applicants will be working on behalf of a variety of retailers and manufacturers of consumer products who are interested in knowing more about how products are displayed and marketed in stores and how customers are treated in such establishments . those hired by such agencies will spend their days effecting specific purchases at specific retailers , afterwards turning in reports about their experiences and collecting fat paychecks for their troubles . <PARA> there are bona fide \u201c secret shopper \u201d jobs to be had , which makes telling sheep from goats regarding which of such job postings are real and which are but the opening gambits of frauds not always a straightforward and simple matter . the real and the fraudulent can be well mixed together at times , with both sorts advertised on the internet and in newspapers . there is therefore no protection to be had from the presumption that an ad which actually appeared on the pages of a newspaper leads to a real job rather than to a vacuuming of one \u2019 s pockets , nor is there certainty in the assumption that that which is advertised in cyberspace is necessarily a con . <PARA> the federal trade commission offers valuable advice about becoming a \u201c mystery shopper ,\u201d including ways to tell the genuine from the attempts to defraud . in a nutshell : <PARA> sometimes such come - ons extend the offer of a money - back guarantee ; that is , the promise that those unsatisfied with whatever they paid to work for their \u201c employers \u201d would get their money returned upon demand . disregard such promises : they are worth nothing and offer no protection . they are included only for the purpose of stilling that \u201c too <MORE> , certified , or teller \u2019 s checks available in one to five days . consequently , funds from checks that might not be good are often released into payees \u2019 accounts or handed to them in cash long before the checks have been honored by their issuing banks . high quality forgeries can be bounced back and forth between banks for weeks before anyone catches on to their being worthless , by which time victims have long since turned over the monies the bank gave them to the con artists who have just taken them for a ride . <PARA> in a common version of this scam , the unsuspecting dupe is supplied with a money order bearing a face value of between $ 2 , 800 and $ 3 , 300 and told to use it at a walmart to purchase a moneygram for the amount of the check less the cost of the wire transfer and the $ 100 or $ 200 the mystery shopper is to keep as payment for his services . the wired amount is to be sent to a person in canada that the sender is to <MASK> is his relative . <PARA> this more potent form of the con game is an updated version of the \u201c reshipper \u201d scam . as in the <MASK> , the pigeon receives a worthless check from the scam artist , cashes it with a financial institution ( in this instance , a money transfer company akin to western union ), keeps a small portion for himself , and sends the remainder to the crossroader running the con . and as in the <MASK> , once the certified or cashier \u2019 s check bounces , the person cashing it becomes liable for the amount the bank or check - cashing agency is out . the differences lies in the <MASK> presented to the victim : in the <MASK> he is led to believe he has been hired by an overseas firm to facilitate the processing of payments from its u . s . customers , but in the \u201c secret shopper \u201d version he is told he has been hired as a \u201c mystery shopper \u201d and that his first assignment is to test the moneygram system to determine how well it performs and how courteously its customers are treated . although the set - up is different , the underlying scam is the same . <PARA> whereas in the traditional \u201c secret shopper \u201d con , those defrauded by it are out only the value of their payments for goods ( training materials ) or services ( certifications or listings in databases of available secret shoppers ) they naively sent off to the scammers who smooth talked them into trying this profession and so limit their losses to only a few hundred dollars , this newer version involving the cashing of checks can leave those who fall for it poorer by thousands of dollars .",

        "text": "some of the most memorable scenes in white wilderness , disney \u2019 s 1958 academy award - winning \u201c <MASK> - life adventure \u201d nature documentary about wildlife in the snowy northern portions of the north american continent , were ones featuring lemming suicide : the death of lemmings who drowned after jumping off cliffs and into the sea . but the scenes shown in the documentary were staged by filmmakers in order to replicate supposed real - life behavior of lemmings that could not be captured on film , and thus did disney perpetuate for generations to come the legend of periodic , inexplicable mass suicides by lemmings who die by hurling themselves off of cliffs . <PARA> the narration in the film accompanying the lemmings scenes begins as follows : <PARA> what the audience then sees is what appears to be a horde of lemmings entering the arctic sea by jumping off cliffs and scampering across rock - covered beaches to enter the water from the shore , whereupon they swim out to sea and ( we \u2019 re told by the narrator ) eventually drown \u2014 not quite because they \u2019 re simply committing suicide , the film <MASK> , but because they \u2019 ve supposedly mistaken the vast expanse of the arctic sea for a lake and assumed there \u2019 s a reachable shore just across the water . <PARA> nonetheless , the narration strongly suggests that the behavior shown in the film is a form of unreasoning , compulsive march to death in which lemmings typically engage : <PARA> none of what was shown in the film was realistic lemming behavior , however . disney \u2019 s white wilderness was filmed the canadian province of alberta , which is not a native habitat for lemmings and is landlocked with no outlet to the sea . the filmmakers had to import lemmings to alberta for use in the documentary ( reportedly by purchasing them from inuit children who had caught them in other provinces ); through the use of carefully controlled camera angles and tight editing , the filmmakers made no more than a few dozen lemmings look like a much larger number , placing them on turntables to create a frenzied migration effect and then herding them off a cliff and into the water ( which was actually the bow river , not an arctic sea ). <PARA> nine different photographers spent three years shooting and assembling footage for the various segments that comprise white wilderness , and it is not known whether walt disney approved or was aware of the activities of james r . simon , the principal photographer for the lemmings sequence . certainly nature documentaries are notoriously difficult to film , as wild animals are not terribly cooperative , and many nature shows and films of this era ( including disney \u2019 s \u201c <MASK> - life adventure \u201d movies and the wild kingdom television series ) staged events to capture exciting footage for their audiences . nonetheless , in this case what was depicted on screen was a complete fabrication , not a recreation of real animal behavior that filmmakers were unable to document on film . <PARA> lemmings do not periodically hurl themselves off cliffs and into the sea . cyclical explosions in population do occasionally induce lemmings to attempt to migrate to areas of lesser population density , and when such migrations occur , some lemmings do die by falling over cliffs or drowning in lakes or rivers . these deaths are neither acts of \u201c suicide \u201d nor the result of compulsive unreasoning behavior , however ; they \u2019 re accidental deaths resulting from lemmings \u2019 venturing into unfamiliar territories and being crowded and pushed over dangerous ledges or venturing into the water in a quest to reach new territory . <PARA> as the alaska department of fish and game noted in an <MASK> about this myth :",

they were always provided for free . <PARA> similarly , the red cross was said to be selling to servicemen cigarettes that had been donated by major tobacco companies . <PARA> the red cross blood donor service was also a target of <MASK> - mongering during wwii . whispers swept along that blood donations had been accepted from the japanese , thereby ( it was said ) making it likely the offspring of those receiving such transfusions would display japanese characteristics . similar concerns were raised about blood from african - americans being added to the pool . <MASK> was also used to discourage those inclined to donate blood : stories were spread that those who gave ran the risk of contracting infection or disease from unsterilized instruments . <PARA> the affairs of dame <MASK> , a 1948 book about <MASK> rampant <MORE> there is truth to one of the <MASK> , however . during wwii the american red cross did indeed charge american servicemen <MASK> abroad for coffee , doughnuts , and lodging . however , they did so because the u . s . army asked them to , not because they were determined to make a profit off homesick dogfaces . <PARA> the request was made in a march 1942 letter from secretary of war henry l . stimson to norman h . davis , chairman of the american red cross . because american soldiers were fighting as part of the allied forces , matters had to be considered on a force - wide ( rather than a solely american ) basis . the red cross was asked to establish club facilities for u . s . servicemen overseas where allied troops would be welcome , and because english and australian soldiers were being charged for the use of such facilities , it was deemed unfair that americans were to get similar benefits for free ( especially in light of the fact that their pay was higher than that of their allied counterparts ). for the good of the alliance , the american red cross was persuaded to exact nominal charges from american gis for off - base food and lodging . <PARA> this act resulted in the red cross \u2019 coming to be regarded by numerous gis as having profited off them . bad feeling exists to this day over the decision to charge american servicemen for these services , with any number of such soldiers and their families carrying long - lasting resentments against the service . yet while that ire might have been merited , it was misdirected : the culprit was the u . s . army , not the red cross . <PARA> general dwight d . eisenhower , chief of staff , united <MASK> army , addressed the controversy surrounding this issue in a <MASK> to the press on 10 april 1946 : <PARA> even after world war ii , the red cross continued to be dogged for years by <MASK> tales about their imposing fees on military personnel for basic humanitarian services , such as the following 1952 <MASK> that <MASK> the organization had charged a u . s . serviceman interest on money he borrowed from them to attend his mother \u2019 s funeral : <PARA> the advent of social media breathed new life into <MASK> the red cross was charging disaster victims , which spiked amid separate online controversies involving the organization following hurricanes harvey and irma in august - september 2017 : <PARA> in a separate <MASK> regarding <MASK> that the red cross was charging disaster victims after hurricane harvey hit in august 2017 , we noted : <PARA> on 31 august 2017 , the red cross detailed how they would be spending their funds in the wake of hurricane harvey , introducing that documentation with the following <MASK> :",

        "text": "i know this subject is rather embarrassing , but i was glad my sister passed this message to me , and i hope you will send it along to other women , too . <PARA> a woman i work with started using the new tampax pearl 5 months ago and that \u2019 s when she started getting yeast infections . they got worse and worse every month and being experienced with yeast infections , she used over - the - counter treatments . they didn \u2019 t help . she finally went to her doctor , who did a pap smear , which didn \u2019 t reveal anything . as it got worse , she finally went to her ob - gyn , who also did a pap smear . it didn \u2019 t test positive , but bacteria showed up . she was then given a prescription to treat a yeast infection and went home . she went back as it got worse and also when , one day while using the bathroom , a clump of something came out . she had no idea what it was initially and threw it away . she quickly thought better of it and wrapped it up and brought it with her in a ziploc baggie to yet another visit to the doctor . she had figured out what it was herself and the doctor confirmed it . it was the tampax pearl fibers . they had been collecting for the past 5 months ! ! she even took an unopened tampon and showed me how the fibers come off so easily . you wouldn \u2019 t notice because the applicator covers it . and how many people open up a tampon and inspect them ? <PARA> well , it hasn \u2019 t ended yet . when she went in last , the doctor went to get some cultures , but found that her cervix was bleeding and it prevented her from getting all the cultures that she needed . the fibers from the tampon are cutting her and making her bleed . but the blood is having a hard time getting out and so there was a lot of old blood in the way when the doctor tried to take the cultures . right now , she is not being treated for anything , not until they can figure out how to treat her . poor woman is uncomfortable and in pain ! most likely , they \u2019 ll have to do a d & c ( did i use the right letters ?) to clean it all out . another girl that i work with also has been using them for a few months and has been having problems , but couldn \u2019 t figure it out . she won \u2019 t be using them anymore . <PARA> i have used a few , just to try them , but will be throwing out any that i have left . <MORE> <PARA> the warning message <MASK> at the head of this page , which purportedly describes the experience of a pearl user who suffered continual yeast infections and then found that fibers from pearl tampons had been accumulating inside her for five months and caused her cervix to bleed , is similarly unlikely . yeast infections are normally caused by a fungus , a particular problem when the normal biological balance of the vagina is disturbed ( e . g ., through changes in hormone levels during pregnancy , use of birth control pills , and the normal fluctuation in ph level of the vagina during menstruation ). nothing about the tampax pearl tampon suggests that it would be the cause of a increased incidence of yeast infections , as it \u2019 s made from the same materials as just about every other tampon . the same reasoning applies to <MASK> of fiber residue and vaginal bleeding or vaginal ulcers : these are problems which are occasionally experienced by users of all brands of tampons and long antedate the development of the tampax pearl . ( fiber residue , which occurs with all brands of tampons , isn \u2019 t really a health concern , as the stray fibers are eventually sloughed off by the vagina along with other menstrual material .) this issue sounds all too much like a rehash of the apocryphal <MASK> about tampon manufacturers using asbestos in their products to promote bleeding and thereby increase sales . <PARA> all that could really be verified about this latter e - mail is that the amy strand who started the message is indeed a real person . a procter & gamble spokesperson informed us that they did contact her employer ( ford ) in their efforts to track down the <MASK> of the <MASK> , and amy strand <MASK> that she had been let go by her employer for violating company policy by using the company system for personal e - mail .

        "text": "<MASK> : the infamous bryan winter e - mail came to life on the internet in may 1999 . wherever it went it seemed to strike a chord with those who received it . angry comments were routinely appended to the basic text , with notes like \u201c he \u2019 s sick ,\u201d \u201c mr . wonderful ,\u201d \u201c this guy should be shot ,\u201d and \u201c what a loser !\u201d popping up on it as it went from forward to forward . clearly , many were angered by this man \u2019 s cavalier treatment of the unnamed woman and were happy to participate in his comeuppance by way of forwarding his personal correspondance to an even wider audience . <PARA> e - mail is a faceless medium , and sometimes its being so brings out the worst in people . brian \u2019 s arrogance and forthrightness would be terribly out of place in a face - to - face environment , but it is becoming more the norm in online society . probably since the day the first e - mail was sent ( which , i \u2019 m told , was a \u201c make spiky club fast \u201d ponzi scheme ), people have been forgetting those they correspond with have real feelings . because the <PARA> communication takes place through a computer and thus there \u2019 s no face to see a reaction register on , it becomes easy to become more persona than person . which , it appears , was bryan \u2019 s crime . so lost in himself and all his dating possibilities , he forgot to be polite . <PARA> the fact of a faceless medium encourages the desire to gain revenge in a way that real - life contacts do not . if bryan winter is objectionable for being a cad , then the woman who sent his e - mail far and wide is just as blameworthy . wrongs will be done to all of us in this life , but the more adult of us know to move on without first attempting to even the score . instead of thanking her lucky stars she \u2019 d quickly found out who the real bryan winter was and thus avoided what would likely have been greater hurt and disappointment down the road , the anonymous woman of this tale chooses to do her best to make this man \u2019 s dating life unliveable . though we might not think much of bryan winter upon reading his words , it \u2019 s impossible to think much more of the woman who is now trying to get back at him . <PARA> but the culpability doesn \u2019 t end there . the faceless medium of e - mail encourages all who receive copies of the bryan winter letter to participate in an anonymous woman \u2019 s revenge scheme by forwarding it to an ever widening circle . we \u2019 ll never know if those were <MORE> post couldn \u2019 t find him . an army of amateur cybersleuths have also failed to turn him up . as for the anonymous woman whose revenge the online community is being asked to participate in , no one knows who she is either . <PARA> could the whole thing be a hoax , a little test of us all to see what we will and will not forward ? if so , we failed . badly . <PARA> as lane gentry of salon said : <PARA> thousands of people who have never met this guy ( or the woman to whom his e - mail was addressed ) jumped at the chance to inflict judgment and more humiliation on a perfect stranger by forwarding his personal correspondence . all of this with minimal prompting and on behalf of someone they \u2019 ve never met . <PARA> perhaps this letter is naught but an outlet for the frustration felt by a number of women in the adrift in the dating world . bryan winter is the archetypical pompous male , utterly convinced he \u2019 s god \u2019 s gift to womankind . his arrogance and emotional detachment are perhaps too perfect to be believed , making him more likely the fictional embodiment of those angers than a real person ; more bogeyman than man , so to speak . <PARA> is it difficult to meet mr . right ? some say yes ; some say no . those who say no don \u2019 t give the bryan winters of this world a second thought . if there are such people out there , they don \u2019 t populate their lives with them , and that \u2019 s that . those who say yes , however , need a bryan winter to point to as an example of what \u2019 s wrong with their world . it \u2019 s far more comforting to believe the dating pool has gone to hell in a handbasket than it is to face the possibility that one might be doing something amiss or perhaps not be as scintillating in reality as in imagination . better to label the grapes as sour than to admit they \u2019 re out of reach . <PARA> the forwarding of the bryan winter e - mail raises a further question \u2014 just how private is private e - mail ? does one have a reasonable expectation of privacy , or should everything be penned with an eye to someday seeing it flashed back to you by a million strangers ? <PARA> as linda tripp showed us , we live in an era when even those considered close friends tape record intimate conversations . setting aside the rose - colored glasses of what should be right and wrong , we should keep in mind that e - mail to someone we barely know is likely best penned with posterity in mind . <PARA> barbara \u201c for yore eyes only \u201d mikkelson",

        "text": "<MASK> : a news <MASK> about a 25 - year - old german woman who faced cuts to her unemployment benefits for turning down a job providing \u201c sexual services \u201d at a brothel was carried by a variety of english - language news sources in january 2005 . it has struck a chord in many <PARA> readers as an example of liberal morality and bureaucracy run amok : if prostitution is legalized ( as it was in germany back in 2002 ), this <MASK> suggests , then society has conferred its approval upon that trade , and prostitution can therefore be proffered to ( and even foisted upon ) women as a valid choice of employment . <PARA> we were initially skeptical about the literal truth of the version reported in the english press , however , because the issue seemed to have received scant attention in the german press . in fact , the <MASK> of this <MASK> was evidently a 18 december 2004 <MASK> published in the berlin newspaper tageszeitung ( also known as taz ) which did not report that women in germany must accept employment in brothels or face cuts in their unemployment benefits . ( although it <MASK> there had been \u201c isolated cases \u201d of such , it did not provide any source or documentation to back up that <MASK> .) <PARA> the tageszeitung merely presented the concept of brothel employment as a technical possibility under current law ; it did not provide any actual cases of women losing their benefits over this issue . the <MASK> also <MASK> representatives from employment agencies as saying that while it might be possible for employment agencies to offer jobs as prostitutes to \u201c long - term unemployed \u201d women , they ( the agencies ) could not require anyone to work in a brothel . ( the agencies noted that brothels used \u201c other recruitment channels \u201d anyway .) <PARA> as an example of how a hypothetical has been manipulated into a truth , consider the following paragraph from the telegraph <MASK> cited above : <PARA> ulrich kueperkoch wanted to open a brothel in goerlitz , in former east germany , but his local job centre withdrew his advertisement for 12 prostitutes , saying it would be impossible to find them . <PARA> mr kueperkoch said that he was confident of demand for a brothel in the area and planned to take a <MASK> for compensation to the highest court . <PARA> mr kueperkoch said that he was confident of demand for a brothel in the area and planned to take a <MASK> for compensation to the highest court . <PARA> then note how this same issue was covered by the german news source deutsche welle : <PARA> a brothel owner in the historic german town of gvrlitz on the polish border is preparing to open his establishment next month but faces a one last serious problem \u2014 he has no staff . ulrich kueperkoch \u2019 s adverts seeking \u201c hostesses for erotic services \u201d for his golden 3 privatclub have been rejected by germany \u2019 s federal labor office even though prostitution is legal in the country . the dispute with the labor office stems from its refusal to allow advertising for prostitutes in the network of job - placement agencies that it runs . a spokesperson said that the labor office has \u201c decided not to be active in that market sector \u201d due to its belief that such work could infringe on an individual \u2019 s rights if he or she is forced to take the job . kueperkoch insists he would only employ those who were interested and not those who felt they had no other choice . <PARA> this was another case where , like a game of \u201c telephone ,\u201d a <MASK> was sensationalized for political purposes and passed from one news source to the next , and somewhere in the rewriting and translating process what was <MASK> discussed as a mere hypothetical possibility has now been reported as a factual occurrence .",

        "text": "in his urban legend book the baby train , folklorist jan harold brunvand writes that he first heard the \u201c dead body found under hotel bed \u201d legend in 1991 . every version that came to him mentioned a las vegas hotel , but the lack of checkable details led him to believe this was an apocryphal tale . <PARA> okay , so we can date the appearance of this legend to 1991 . unlike a number of other such gruesome tales , this legend appears to have sprung from a misremembering of any one of a number of actual news items , with the talebearer shifting certain details so that deaths which took place in anonymous little motels along <MASK> are said to have happened in las vegas , america \u2019 s own sin city , and victims who \u2019 d ( usually ) done little else amiss than be in the wrong place at the wrong time and / or take up with questionable company were transformed through the magic of retelling into prostitutes . <PARA> dead bodies get stashed in the box spring or the bed \u2019 s pedestal more often than you \u2019 d want to believe . what \u2019 s more , a fair number of them are only discovered days later ... after the new tenant complains about a persistent and disagreeable odor . <PARA> in each of the following cases not only were bodies discovered under hotel beds , but it was investigations of the smell of decomposition that led to their discoveries . <PARA> on 10 july 2003 , a man checked into the capri motel , just east of downtown kansas city , and began complaining about a foul odor in his room . management told him nothing could be done about the problem , and he spent three nights in his room before checking out because he could no longer stand the smell . when the cleaning staff came in to make up the room on 13 july , they lifted the mattress and underneath found a man \u2019 s body in an advanced stage of decomposition . <PARA> on 10 june 1999 the rapidly decomposing remains of 64 - year - old saul hernandez were discovered inside the bed in room 112 at the burgundy motor inn in atlantic city , new jersey . a german couple had spent the night sleeping over hernandez \u2019 s remains , and it was their complaint to the manager about the smell in their room which led to the discovery of the corpse . <PARA> in july 1996 a woman \u2019 s body was found under a mattress in the colorado boulevard travelodge in pasadena , ca . apparently the motel \u2019 s staff discovered her ten days after her demise and only after guests had complained for several days of a foul odor coming from that room . <PARA> there were two stashed - and - smelly body cases in florida <MORE> where millbrook had been living just prior to her disappearance , her body having just been discovered inside the frame of the bed there \u2014 even though the room had reportedly been cleaned and rented several times since her disappearance almost seven weeks earlier . <PARA> there are , of course , numerous other cases of dead bodies being left under hotel beds , but i \u2019 ve chosen not to report on these because they lack the key element of the legend : complaints about the presence of a horrific smell leading to the corpse \u2019 s discovery . what gives this urban legend its chills - down - the - spine gruesomeness is the body \u2019 s being found only after an unsuspecting traveler spends the night sleeping above it . that clearly happened in at least some of the cases mentioned here ( and perhaps in others where the news reports <MASK> only that hotel guests had complained without specifying which guests ). <PARA> urban legends tend to localize to where we believe they likely would have happened . it \u2019 s easy to understand how in each of the versions brunvand related that las vegas was always named as the city where the corpse reposed , for vegas is indeed viewed as sin city , usa . much easier to believe that the unsuspecting traveler shared his room with a moldering corpse in las vegas than it is to ( rightly ) place that occurrence in small - town new york , virginia , or maryland . especially when dealing with a half - remembered <MASK> <MASK> , it \u2019 s natural for the \u201c obvious \u201d details to replace facts that have been misplaced due to ordinary fuzziness of memory . one , after all , does not let a lack of certainty stand in the way of a good <MASK> . <PARA> keep in mind that the deirdre smith ( 1989 , virginia ), marilyn graham ( 1989 , virginia ), mary jean deoliviera ( 1988 , new york ), john doe ( 1987 , maryland ), and gary smith ( 1982 , new york ) cases antedate 1991 . gruesome finds like those tend to get heavily reported on , and that certainly happened with smith , graham and deoliviera ( the cites below don \u2019 t begin to do justice to the coverage these discoveries got \u2014 they were reported on by a double handful of various papers across the usa ). it is because of that widespread coverage that i lean towards this legend \u2019 s having sprung to life out of a <MASK> <MASK> whose location got shifted from your town , usa ( where only nice people live ) to sin city ( where life and room rates are cheap ). <PARA> sightings : look for this legend in the 1995 film four rooms . this legend was also the subject of a july 2014 fake news <MASK> .",

        "text": "<MASK> : america \u2019 s first affordable v8 - powered car was an automobile introduced in 1932 by the ford motor company , one which quickly grew tremendously popular and received effusive praise from motorists . among those enthusiastic drivers was texas <PARA> resident clyde barrow , who , along with his female companion , bonnie parker , embarked that year on an infamous crime spree that would firmly establish the pair as american legends . throughout a two - year period from 1932 to 1934 , during which bonnie and clyde engaged in a string of robberies in texas and surrounding <MASK> , clyde barrow repeatedly stole ford v8 automobiles at every opportunity , as the vehicles \u2019 powerful engines , combined with clyde \u2019 s superlative driving skills , enabled the barrow gang to continually evade the pursuit of lawmen throughout the midwest . <PARA> such was clyde barrow \u2019 s appreciation for the ford v8 that he supposedly penned and mailed the following laudatory letter to company founder henry ford in april 1934 : <PARA> mr . henry ford <PARA> detroit , mich . <PARA> dear sir : <PARA> while i still have got breath in my lungs i will tell you what a dandy car you make . i have drove fords exclusively when i could get away with one . for sustained speed and freedom from trouble the ford has got every other car skinned , and even if my business hasen \u2019 t been strickly legal it don \u2019 t hurt anything to tell you what a fine car you got in the v8 . <PARA> yours truly <PARA> clyde champion barrow <PARA> dear sir : <PARA> while i still have got breath in my lungs i will tell you what a dandy car you make . i have drove fords exclusively when i could get away with one . for sustained speed and freedom from trouble the ford has got every other car skinned , and even if my business hasen \u2019 t been strickly legal it don \u2019 t hurt anything to tell you what a fine car you got in the v8 . <PARA> yours truly <PARA> clyde champion barrow <PARA> the letter bore a postmark indicating it was mailed from tulsa , oklahoma , on 10 april 1934 , and it was received by henry ford on 13 april 1934 at his office in downtown detroit . ford , assuming the letter to be real , had his secretary draft a \u2018 thank you \u2019 reply which was sent to clyde care of general delivery in tulsa ( although he never received it , as the barrow gang had headed out of tulsa by then ). <PARA> seventy - five years later , the question remains : was this letter ( which is kept on display at the henry ford museum ) actually written by clyde barrow ? some skeptics have pointed out that its handwriting appears to be a <MORE> gang \u2019 s exploits . an endnote in guinn \u2019 s biography of bonnie and clyde indicates that he ( as well as clyde \u2019 s sister ) doubted the authenticity of both letters : <PARA> in print and in conversation , marrie barrow scoma vehemently denied the letters to amon carter and henry ford were written by her brother . while it \u2019 s fun to think they were , marie was almost undoubtedly right . clyde wouldn \u2019 t have signed a bogus middle name to the ford letter , and the carter letter was mailed from the small north texas hamlet of decatur on a date when the barrow gang had fled the <MASK> for oklahoma . still , many historians have accepted them as clyde \u2019 s handiwork . no one will ever know for certain . <PARA> one month after the mailing of the reputed clyde barrow letter to henry ford , a quirky repetition occurred when the ford motor company announced it had received the following letter , dated 16 may 1934 and postmarked from detroit : <PARA> hello old pal . arrived here at 10 : 00 am today . would like to drop in and see you . you have a wonderful car . been driving it for weeks . it \u2019 s a treat to drive one . your slogan should be , drive a ford and watch the other cars fall behind you . i can make any other car take a ford \u2019 s dust ! <PARA> bye - bye , <PARA> john dillinger <PARA> bye - bye , <PARA> john dillinger <PARA> unlike the barrow letter , this latter missive was conclusively demonstrated to be a forgery when it was compared with earlier <PARA> samples of dillinger \u2019 s handwriting . <PARA> ( the hoax was probably based on the mistaken notion that dillinger had been part of the gang who held up the citizens commercial savings bank in flint , michigan , on 18 may 1934 . dillinger was later determined to have been elsewhere at the time .) <PARA> the high quality and speed of ford motor company automobiles extolled in these criminals \u2019 letters did not enable them to survive much longer , however . despite the legendary driving skills that helped john dillinger elude capture time and again , he was gunned down by fbi agents while walking outside the biograph theater in chicago just 67 days after his putative letter to ford . in another eerie synchronicity , clyde barrow ( with his partner in crime , bonnie parker ) was killed in a firestorm of bullets from a police ambush in louisiana six weeks after his alleged letter to ford . unlike dillinger , however , clyde barrow provided a fitting ending by dying at the wheel of a purloined ford v8 . <PARA> barbara \u201c 184 bullet holes \u2014 wow , he shouldn \u2019 t have had a v8 \u2032\u2032 mikkelson",

        "text": "it \u2019 s difficult for those who weren \u2019 t around to experience the 1960s first - hand to fully understand the controversy that swirled around radical parties such as the black panthers . certainly many americans viewed them as representing the very worst of that era \u2019 s political movements : a group of hate - filled militant thugs who felt their disaffection with the existing social and political systems justified anything required to achieve their aim of \u201c revolution by any means necessary \u201d ( such as smuggling guns into a marin county courtroom in an attempt to free panther george jackson , resulting in a shoot - out that killed a judge , two inmates , and jackson \u2019 s brother ). others at the time , however , believed the panthers were the only political group that truly represented a downtrodden and marginalized group of people who had been enslaved , discriminated against , and denied civil rights protections for hundreds of years ; that sought to improve the condition of the poor by operating schools , opening medical clinics , and providing free breakfasts for ghetto children ; and that had the courage to stand up to the brutality visited upon them by law enforcement acting in the service of a government and a society that sought to \u201c keep them in their place .\u201d <PARA> in may of 1969 , black panther founder and national chairman bobby seale ( who had already been indicted for his alleged participation in demonstrations at the democratic national convention in chicago in august 1968 ) made a trip from oakland to new haven , connecticut , to speak at yale university . the black panthers were by then nationally known , a focus of media attention , and under the active surveillance of the fbi . ( j . edgar hoover had publicly declared several months earlier that he considered the panthers \u201c the greatest threat to the internal security of the country .\u201d) <MASK> of police informants and government spies having infiltrated the party were rampant , and a man named alex rackley , a member of the panthers \u2019 new york chapter , fell under suspicion . rackley was taken to the home of warren kimbro ( described as a \u201c community organizer and aspiring panther \u201d) where he was held captive for 24 hours , beaten , and scalded with boiling water in an effort to force him to confess . rackley was then taken to a marsh in middlefield by kimbro , george sams ( a panther field marshal and , according to some , himself a police informant ), and lonnie mclucas ( a panther member from bridgeport ), where sams ordered kimbro and mclucas to kill the suspected informant . ( who did the actual killing has always been disputed : mclucas reportedly fired the first shot , but kimbro admitted to delivering the bullet to the head that killed rackley .) <MORE> panthers during their trial .\u201d this <MASK> is ridiculously far - fetched : yale university went to a \u201c voluntarily optional \u201d class schedule ( it did not \u201c shut down \u201d) for a few months at the end of the term in mid - 1970 because thousands of black panther protesters had flooded the campus and its environs , not because of anything hillary clinton or bill lee did . and while the panthers made have found many sympathetic supporters among the student body at yale , neither hillary clinton or bill lee led or participated in student demonstrations in support of the black panthers , or spoke up in their defense . <PARA> the above - <MASK> <MASK> also asks \u201c how in the world do you think that these killers got off so easy ? well , maybe it was in some part due to the efforts of two people who came to the defense of the panthers .\u201d but neither bill lee nor hillary clinton \u201c defended \u201d the panthers , either in a public or a legal sense . bill lee wasn \u2019 t a lawyer , or even a law student ; he was simply another yale undergraduate who had no involvement in the black panthers \u2019 trial . hillary rodham ( as she was known then ) wasn \u2019 t a lawyer then , either : she was a yale law student , and like many of her politically - minded fellow law students who saw the latest \u201c trial of the century \u201d taking place just outside the main gate of their school , she took advantage of an opportunity to be involved in the case in a minor , peripheral way by organizing other students to help the american civil liberties union monitor the trials for civil rights violations . her tangential participation in the trial in no way helped \u201c free \u201d black panthers tried for the murder of alex rackley <PARA> in fact , the killers of alex rackley didn \u2019 t \u201c go free \u201d: lonnie mclucas was found guilty of conspiracy to commit murder and sentenced to twelve to fifteen years in prison , and warren kimbro and george sams turned <MASK> \u2019 s <MASK> and pleaded guilty to second degree murder , serving four years in prison . bobby seale and ericka huggins ( who were accused not of killing rackley , but of being present during his captivity and boiling water to torture him with ) went free not due to any efforts on the part of hillary clinton or bill lee , but because the <MASK> failed to sufficiently prove its case against them : the jury deadlocked in favor of acquittal for both defendants , and the trial judge dismissed the charges against both of them . and , of course , neither hillary clinton nor bill lee had anything to do with the post - trial lives of seale and huggins .",

down no - frills look will likely come as a shock to those who <PARA> have been conditioned to believe proper fitness palaces should be fashioned of glass and gleaming chrome and populated by herds of designer - garbed hard - bodied 20 - somethings setting new land speed records on treadmills and exercise bikes . at curves , there are no lockers or showers , and the clientele is predominently middle - aged and overweight . the equipment members use is set up in a circle . every 30 seconds those working out are told to move to the next <MASK> , which is either another machine that works different muscle groups or a space between two machines where exercisers run or walk in place . a typical curves workout regimen is 30 minutes a day , three times a week . <PARA> because the equipment is hydraulic , it adapts to each user \u2019 s level of fitness , making these workouts suitable for anyone regardless of physical conditioning . women like the curves program for its \u201c 30 minutes and you \u2019 re on your way \u201d aspect , but also for the camaraderie that comes from exercising with others , which appears to be spurred on by the arrangement of the workout <MASK> in a circle . friendships form . encouragement is given . a sense of \u201c we \u2019 re all in this together \u201d pervades . <PARA> more than 7 , 000 outlets since 1992 . obviously , they \u2019 re doing something <PARA> right . <PARA> this highly successful chain is the brainchild of gary heavin , a texas businessman who earlier in his life had a 17 - location fitness center chain before filing bankruptcy , divorcing , losing custody of his two children , and serving a six - month jail sentence for failure to pay child support . although a christian from his teen years , he re - committed his life to christ while in jail , after which he and his new wife ( whom he married just before his incarceration ) opened the first curves in harlingen , <MORE> the contributions as a percentage of the company \u2019 s annual gross revenues . but the curves spokeswoman said that those pledges , as well as millions of dollars in donations to a wide range of charities , came from heavin \u2019 s personal wealth . <PARA> the column also referred to heavin \u2019 s comments in a \u201c recent christianity today \u201d <MASK> that he \u201c is proud to support these organizations .\u201d in fact , the interview was published in the january - february issue of today \u2019 s christian , a magazine affiliated with christianity today . in it , heavin expressed his anti - abortion views but did not talk about his support for any specific organization . <PARA> in addition , jon carroll , in his april 20 datebook column , erred in referring to heavin \u2019 s comments as appearing in \u201c christianity today \u201d and by <MASK> that heavin \u201c donates 10 percent of curves profits \u201d to \u201c anti - choice groups .\u201d he also wrote that heavin \u2019 s recipients were allied with operation save america , a radical anti - abortion group . as <MASK> in a may 4 clarification on rosen \u2019 s column , operation save america has praised those recipients on its web site but does not provide financial support , nor does it have a formal alliance with them . <PARA> the chronicle regrets the errors . <PARA> gary heavin is far from the first successful businessman to underwrite reproductive causes \u2014 tom monaghan of domino \u2019 s pizza and carl karcher , founder of the california - based hamburger chain carl \u2019 s jr ., have been very open and public regarding their support of the pro - life philosophy , just as warren buffett , ranked by forbes magazine as the second - richest man in the world , has been forthcoming about his backing of pro - choice programs . in each instance , these men are acting as private citizens who choose to bestow parts of their fortunes on the causes they believe in , not as officers of their corporations . the money is theirs to do with as they please , just as anyone \u2019 s paycheck belongs to the person who earns it and stops being the employer \u2019 s money at the moment it is paid out . that a spendthrift employee might choose to gamble away his earnings doesn \u2019 t mean the company he works for supports gambling ; likewise , that a wealthy man financially supports particular causes doesn \u2019 t mean the corporation that paid him the money favors those movements . <PARA> all this is by way of saying that while it \u2019 s correct to identify gary heavin as a patron of pro - life endeavors , it would not be right to point to curves as a supporter of those same causes . <PARA> barbara \u201c cause and effect \u201d mikkelson",

( the unapproved anti - cancer drug laetrile is a semisynthetic derivative of amygdalin ; a cheaper version of laetrile produced in mexico came from crushed apricot pits .) <PARA> a far greater natural source of cyanide is the cassava root , a vegetable favored by many in africa . ( westerners know this plant best as tapioca .) drying , soaking , and baking cassava roots renders its cyanide precursor , linamarin , harmless , but if that process is not carried out properly the cassava can remain poisonous .",

( president trump had disbanded two of his business advisory councils after several corporate leaders resigned from them in response to his comments about the \u2018 unite the right rally \u2019 in charlottesville . the remark by lemonis that was seized upon occurred in the following context : <PARA> lemonis said that anyone \u201c in favor of what has been said in the last couple of days \u201d should not shop at his business . he did not say anyone who supported president trump , or even agreed with president trump in general , should not shop at his stores . in fact , he didn \u2019 t even reference president trump specifically , simply referring generally to \u201c what has been said in the last couple of days .\u201d however , interpreting his comment to mean that anyone who agreed with what president trump said about charlottesville should not shop at his stores was a reasonable reading of his remarks , given the context ( i . e ., he was answering a question about businesses \u2019 distancing themselves from the white house over trump \u2019 s response to the charlottesville rally ) and the fact that earlier in the interview , lemonis said : \u201c i of course , along with the other ceos , are horrified by what we \u2019 re hearing and seeing from this administration ...\u201d <PARA> we asked camping world to verify whose comments ( and which comments ) lemonis was referring to when he mentioned \u201c what has been said in the last couple of days \u201d, but we did not receive a response in time for publication . <PARA> what lemonis <MASK> he said <PARA> on 21 august , marcus lemonis released a video message addressing the controversy surrounding his cnbc remarks . in it , he inaccurately described what he said on power lunch in the following ways : <PARA> in fact , these are inaccurate descriptions and summaries of what lemonis said on cnbc . he did not mention \u201c what happened in charlottesville ,\u201d or \u201c what was said in charlottesville ,\u201d nor \u201c being okay with \u201d violence , hatred , racism , or bigotry . he referenced \u201c what was said in the last couple of days \u201d in the context of answering a question about business leaders distancing themselves from the white house after president trump \u2019 s remarks about charlottesville . <PARA> it is noteworthy that lemonis \u2019 cnbc interview took place on 16 august , four days after the white supremacist rally and counter - protest in charlottesville , but just one day after president trump \u2019 s widely criticized remarks on the rally , in which he said there was \u201c blame on both sides \u201d and that there were \u201c very fine people \u201d on both sides . <PARA> we also asked camping world how marcus lemonis reconciled his remarks on cnbc with his subsequent descriptions of them , but we again did not receive a response in time for publication . we also asked the company whether lemonis condemned president trump \u2019 s remarks on charlottesville , but we did not receive a response to that question either . <PARA> the views marcus lemonis expressed in his follow - up video message may well reflect his considered position on the issue , but they are not what he said on cnbc . <PARA> conclusion <PARA> lemonis certainly did not say that anyone who supports or generally agrees with president trump should not shop at his stores . however , contrary to his own inaccurate descriptions of his cnbc interview , lemonis did strongly appear to have suggested that anyone who agreed with president trump \u2019 s controversial remarks about the events of 12 august 2017 in charlottesville , virginia , should not shop at his stores .",

        "text": "on 7 august 2017 , the conservative college news site campus reform posted a <MASK> reporting that a university of georgia business professor had instituted a \u201c stress reduction policy \u201d that allowed students to select their own grades : <PARA> no reporters have been able to reach watson to clarify the content of the syllabus , but the \u201c stress reduction policy \u201d allowing students to write their own grades was likely written in jest . <PARA> a person who knows watson and asked to remain anonymous told us the policy was probably satire meant to inspire discussion about fairness on the first day of class . the person described watson , who has taught at uga for nearly 30 years , as a tough professor that \u201c doesn \u2019 t put up with nonsense \u201d and holds his students to a high standard . <PARA> the syllabus that contains the \u201c stress reduction policy \u201d was found on watson \u2019 s personal page at uga \u2019 s terry school of business for a class called data management . campus reform reports that the same policy was written on a syllabus for a second class , energy informatics , but was altered before it was archived . the syllabi for watson \u2019 s classes can also be viewed and downloaded from the university \u2019 s business school page as well . these versions do not contain the \u201c stress reduction policy .\u201d <PARA> the archived syllabus , which was dated 4 august 2017 , has a section that reads : <PARA> the university seemed to confirm that watson did indeed write the policy with a <MASK> distributed to reporters , in which business school dean ben ayers said it did not comport with university policy : <PARA> we asked follow - up questions about the incident , but got no response from the university spokesman . <PARA> because the <MASK> went viral , numerous outlets published stories about the syllabus . some simply reported that the \u201c policy \u201d had been nixed thanks to internet outrage , while others opined that it proved the popular idea among some politically - partisan blogs that college students are coddled and overly - sensitive . but none of the reporters who wrote about the incident spoke to watson . we have tried to reach him and have received no response . <PARA> maureen downey , long - time education columnist for the atlanta journal - constitution , told us she has also been unable to reach watson directly \u2014 but she has spoken to multiple people who know him , some of whom believe watson \u2019 s \u201c stress reduction policy \u201d was a dig at georgia \u2019 s new campus carry policy . in an e - mail , she told us : <PARA> based on her interviews , downey said there are two working theories about watson \u2019 s supposed policy : <PARA> aside from the \u201c stress reduction policy ,\u201d nothing about watson \u2019 s syllabi or information about him online suggests that the professor is soft on his students . three students who were enrolled in his energy informatics course wrote on the web site ratemyprofessor that the class was difficult and described watson as a challenging instructor . no mention was made of a policy that allowed them to pick their own grades . two of the students took his class in spring 2016 and wrote : <PARA> a third student wrote in 2014 : <PARA> in other parts of watson \u2019 s syllabi , he seems fairly demanding \u2014 if students wish to use a laptop in class they can only do so for classwork and note - taking , and have to send their notes to him after class so that he can verify that \u2019 s what they were doing . students are not allowed to miss more than four classes without being automatically dropped or withdrawn . he has a \u201c freeloader \u201d policy to ensure each student is pulling their own weight in group work , and allows the group to \u201c fire \u201d a student who isn \u2019 t chipping in : <PARA> watson \u2019 s biography on his personal page at the university suggests he has a dry sense of humor . he was born and raised in australia but now teaches in athens , georgia , and he joked : <PARA> watson has authored two text books on his subject matter and has taught at universities all over the world , from sweden to ethiopia . he founded the department of information systems at edith cowan university in australia and was described by downey as a nationally - respected professor . <PARA> although it is apparent that watson did write the \u201c stress reduction policy \u201d into a syllabus on his web site , it seems extremely likely that he did not intend to actually allow students to select their own grades ; rather , the policy was written as a sarcastic response to the <MASK> \u2019 s new campus carry law , or \u2014 as one theory suggested \u2014 to spark a discussion in class about academic rigor and responsibility .",

nearly all of us feel we \u2019 re spending too much time at our jobs , are anonymous cogs in corporate machines whose disappearance ( or death ) would scarcely be noticed by our co - workers and employers , and are spending our lives at work ( literally ). <PARA> so of course people took to the <MASK> of dead - but - undiscovered george turklebaum , which the birmingham [ england ] sunday mercury <MASK> to have broken when it reported his death as a \u201c crazy worlds \u201d item on 17 december 2000 ( even though the same item , minus some of the details , had been run by the guardian and the bbc a few days earlier ). the <MASK> of turklebaum \u2019 s tragic demise was picked up and printed by several other newspapers in great britain ( including the london times ) in december and january and soon garnered a tremendous amount of attention ( especially in birmingham , alabama , as confused readers mistakenly bombarded that city \u2019 s newspapers with queries about turklebaum ). in response to all the inquiries it received , on 28 january 2001 the sunday mercury published the following : <PARA> well of course the <MASK> is <MASK> !

<PARA> this drink is sold in all the supermarkets in our country and our <PARA> children are consuming it on a trial basis , it can be mortal . <PARA> red bull was created to stimulate the brains in people who are subjected <PARA> to great physical force and in stress coma and never to be consumed like <PARA> an innocent drink or soda pop . <PARA> red bull is the energizer drink that is commercialized world - wide with <PARA> its slogan :\u2019 it increases endurance ; awakens the concentration capacity <PARA> and the speed of reaction , offers more energy and improves the mood . all <PARA> this can be found in a can of red bull , the power drink of the <PARA> millennium . <PARA> \u2018 red bull has managed to arrive at almost 100 countries worldwide . the <PARA> red bull logo is targeted at young people and sportsmen , two attractive <PARA> segments that have been captivated by the stimulus that the drink <PARA> provides . <PARA> it was created by dietrich mateschitz , an industrialist of austrian <PARA> <MASK> who discovered the drink by chance <MORE> the second of the <MASK> that needed to be addressed , red bull does contain glucuronolactone . but as we \u2019 ve seen , that ingredient is apparently innocuous . <PARA> the beverage was <MASK> concocted in austria in 1987 , and it was marketed as an energy drink that \u201c improves muscle tone ,\u201d \u201c increases endurance 25 percent \u201d and \u201c invigorates mind and body .\u201d whatever wildly optimistic health benefits it laid <MASK> to , the drink \u2019 s appeal among young people stems from its <MASK> legendary energy boosting properties , which it gets from its high caffeine content . the caffeine in one can of red bull ( 80 mg ) equals that of one cup of black coffee ( which varies in caffeine content from 80 to 180 mg depending on how it is prepared ). the drink also contains taurine , a derivative of the sulphur - containing amino acid , cysteine . taurine is often found as an ingredient in infant milk formulas . <PARA> criticisms of the beverage primarily have to do with the amount of caffeine ( equivalent to that found in a typical cup of coffee ) and sugar ( about 5 teaspoons per 250 ml can ) contained in the brew . caffeine is deadly when ingested in a massive dose , but the amount estimated to prove fatal is ten grams , which would require 125 cans of the drink . disregarding the marketing hype , sugar is no better at giving energy than any other food or drink . the best fluids for rehydration contain just a pinch of salt and sugar , which makes red bull a highly unusual sports drink . <PARA> despite whatever conclusions one might draw from the name , red bull contains no substances of animal <MASK> . even the taurine used in the formulation is synthetically produced . <PARA> yet concern remains , fueled by misgivings about the drink \u2019 s high concentrations of caffeine , a lurking gut feeling that large amounts of taurine might not be beneficial for folks , and suspicion that red bull somehow caused four deaths . <PARA> in 1991 , the deaths of three people in sweden who expired after drinking red bull were reported . two of the deceased had mixed the drink with alcohol , the other downed it undiluted during rigorous exercise . no direct <MASK> emerged to demonstrate that red bull was at fault in any of those deaths . in 1999 , 18 - year - old irish basketball player ross cooney drank three red bulls before expiring on the court . the coroner attributed the young man \u2019 s demise to thickened arteries and sudden adult death syndrome , yet due to guilt by association , his having had three cans of red bull just before his life ended was perceived by some as an causal element of his death . <PARA> barbara \u201c no bull \u201d mikkelson",

        "text": "this came about because they implemented a policy requiring students and parents to be responsible for their children \u2019 s absences and missing homework . the school and teachers are being sued by parents who want their children \u2019 s failing grades changed to passing grades even though those children were absent 15 - 30 times during the semester and did not complete enough school work to pass their classes . this was voted unanimously by the office staff as the actual answering machine message for the school : <PARA> \u201c hello ! you have reached the automated answering service of your school . in order to assist you in connecting the right staff member , please listen to all your options before making a selection : <PARA> <MASK> : the palisades charter schools are a consortium of public schools in pacific palisades , california , that have received charters from the los angeles unified school district ( lausd ) allowing them to operate autonomously . according to the palisades charter schools foundation : <PARA> the purpose of these schools is to improve student learning ; encourage the use of different and innovative teaching methods ; create new professional opportunities for teachers , including the opportunity to be responsible for the learning program at the schools site ; provide parents and students with expanded educational opportunities within the public school system without the constraints of traditional bureaucratic rules and structure ; and provide schools a way to shift from a rule - based to a performance based system of accountability . in essence , charter schools allow for increased flexibility in exchange for increased accountability . <PARA> in 1998 the sole high school in the palisades charter schools group , the 2 , 400 - student palisades charter high school , instituted an attendance policy mandating that any student absent without a valid excuse ten or more days per <PARA> semester be failed , regardless of his academic achievements . one of the results of this policy was that in february 2002 forty palisades high teachers assigned a total of 130 failing grades to students whose classwork would otherwise have merited passing grades , because those students recorded absences and tardiness in excess of the school \u2019 s <MASK> attendance policy . <PARA> after vociferous complaints ( and threats of lawsuits ) from parents who contended they were unaware of , or didn \u2019 t agree with , palisades high \u2019 s attendance policy ( even though every student and parent had been informed of it ), lausd officials said the failing marks might have to be voided because the attendance policy was not submitted to and approved by the school board . without board approval , the school must follow the policies of the lausd , which <MASK> that students must be graded on the work they do and attendance may not be used as a reason to fail <PARA> them . <PARA> palisades high officials maintained that lausd district administrators had a copy of palisades \u2019 attendance policy in their possession when they approved palisades charter high , and that in any case , palisades \u2019 charter school <MASK> allowed school officials to set their own rules without inteference from the district . as education week noted , the lausd \u2019 s \u201c decision rankled the teachers , who argue [ d ] that their charter school <PARA> is exempt from such governance , but it also has sparked a heated conversation about standards , accountability , teachers \u2019 rights , and the influence of politically powerful parents .\u201d <PARA> the putative answering machine message for palisades charter high <MASK> above was concocted in part as a reaction to the brouhaha over the school \u2019 s attendance policy , and in part as a sardonic expression of all the usual frustrations teachers experience in dealing with students and parents : fabricated excuses for students \u2019 absences and uncompleted homework , blame that teachers are solely responsible for the failures of non - achieving students , complaints from parents about not having received information already sent to them several times , etc . however , the staff \u201c voted \u201d for the message only in the sense that they agreed with its sentiments ( the circulating version of this piece often omits the introductory line \u201c too bad they can \u2019 t actually use it ...\u201c); it was not ever actually placed on the phone answering system at palisades charter high . ( in fact , the palisades charter high phone system didn \u2019 t have menu options when we checked in december 2002 : a switchboard operator fielded calls when the office was open , and a recording invited callers to leave voicemail or press keys to access a specific extension directly when the office was closed .) <PARA> variations : a march 2009 version ( circulated with an mp3 recording ) identified the institution with the unusual phone message as maroochydore high school , in queensland , australia , and added a further \u201c menu option \u201d of \u2018 if you want this in another language , move to a country that speaks it .\u2019",

( it is also easily scarred , which is why wedding bands are typically made from 14k or 10k alloys of the metal rather than from it in its pure form \u2014 that which is added that debases the purity of the gold also serves to harden the metal , making it far more difficult for wearers to inadvertently inflict scratches onto their treasured bijous .) <PARA> another <MASK> to dog the beverage speculates that the shiny flakes in the drink aren \u2019 t really gold but are instead either color - treated cinnamon or corn starch . that one is easy to explain : because gold is known to be a precious substance that costs a great deal of money , the more suspicious among us conclude the liqueur \u2019 s manufacturer wouldn \u2019 t want to go to the expense of wasting the real stuff on consumers when a cheap look - alike would suffice . such folks , however , fail to appreciate how very little gold there is in the product \u2014 because the gold is in flake form , it appears to have a much larger presence that it really does . <PARA> barbara \u201c gold pated \u201d mikkelson",

mail , august 2013 ] <PARA> a couple lost their 25 year old son in a fire at home on june 4th . the son who had graduated with mba from the university of wisconsin - madison two weeks earlier had come home for a while . he had lunch with his dad at home and decided to go back to clean up his hostel room . his father told him to wait , to meet his mother , before he went back for a few days . he decided to take a nap while waiting for his mom to come back home from work . some time later their neighbors called 911 when they saw black smoke coming out of the house . <PARA> unfortunately , the 25 years old died in the three year old house . it took several days of investigation to find out the cause of the fire . it was determined that the fire was caused by the laptop resting on the bed . when the laptop was on the bed cooling fan did not get the air to cool the computer and that is what caused the fire . he did not even wake up to get out of the bed because <MORE> smoke issuing from the house that afternoon called the fire department , which arrived within minutes and began battling the blaze . gopalratnam \u2019 s body was discovered after the fire had been extinguished . <PARA> total damage to the home and its contents was estimated at $ 250 , 000 . <PARA> despite the e - mail \u2019 s assertion that the blaze had been touched off by use of a laptop in bed , captain tod doebler of the menomonee <PARA> falls fire department told us in august 2010 that the fire was still under investigation and no determination as to its cause has yet been made . he later told us in response to a follow - up inquiry that the department had ended its investigation without having been able to determine a conclusive cause for the fire . <PARA> captain doebler confirmed during our phone call with him that the fire began in the bedroom used by the deceased , and that both a cell phone and laptop computer were present in that room . however , that these two items were found in the room where the fire started does not necessarily mean either of these electronic devices caused the fire . house fires can start in many ways , including electrical malfunctions in a home \u2019 s wiring . no one can reasonably say with certainty that he knows what started the blaze , let alone categorically <MASK> the laptop was to blame because its air vents had been blocked . <PARA> laptops have occasionally touched off house fires , but in instances where the distinct causes were known , the majority of incidents involved mechanical flaws in the units or their batteries \u2014 otherwise - robust laptops do not as a rule start fires even when their air intake vents are blocked . moreover , nearly all major - manufacturer laptop cpus now include automatic thermal shutdowns to prevent them from overheating , so the possibility that a properly functioning laptop could ignite a housefire are virtually nil . therefore , the key factor about the e - mailed caution is that it misleadingly uses the circumstances of the death of arun gopalratnam to assert that any laptop ( not just ones with faulty batteries or suspect wiring ) could cause similar deadly fires if used on surfaces that compromised their air vents , such as beds or pillows . <PARA> while it is generally not a good idea to leave unattended powered - up laptops ( or indeed most any other electronic devices ) perched upon pillows or mattresses or surrounded by easily combustible materials ( such as comforters and blankets ), or to fall asleep while using portable computers in bed , most of the inherent danger comes from the risk of one \u2019 s personal computer being one of those rare units that has a bad battery or has been wired improperly . <PARA> barbara \u201c overheated response \u201d mikkelson",

era decision to put 321 acres of land in trust on behalf of the tribe . although the final outcome rests on a court \u2019 s interpretation of whether the tribe was under \u201c federal jurisdiction \u201d according to a 1934 law , the land is viewed by the indigenous community as their means to future self - determination . <PARA> thus , as many americans planned for a thanksgiving feast , tribe members and their supporters marched on the u . s . capitol protesting the decision , which they say could cost them lands the tribe has lived on for 12 , 000 years . <PARA> in an op - ed for the boston globe explaining the community \u2019 s plight , tribal council vice chairwoman jessie little doe baird wrote : <PARA> according to court documents , the situation stemmed from a years -

determination and self - governance \u201d as well as housing , education , and cultural preservation . they also wanted to ensure the preservation of an ancestral burial ground and develop land in taunton for an indian gaming facility \u201c with revenues intended to support the mashpee tribal government and meet the needs of tribal members ,\u201d court documents <MASK> . <PARA> mashpee wampanoag members received happy news on 18 september 2015 when they were informed the federal government would acquire 151 acres in taunton and 170 in mashpee and hold the land in trust for the tribe . but some east taunton residents filed suit over the issue in 2016 , and a federal court sided with the residents against the tribe , holding that the interior department did not have the authority to take land in trust for the tribe in the manner they did . <PARA> both parties appealed that decision , but in 2017 the u . s . justice department dropped their participation in the appeal , leaving the mashpee wampanoag to contest the issue on their own . then on 7 september 2018 , the doi issued a decision that reversed their previous one , finding that the mashpee wampanoag were not eligible to have land held in federal trust for them because they didn \u2019 t meet the criterion of having been considered \u201c under federal jurisdiction \u201d in 1934 , the year the indian reorganization act ( ira ) was passed , a <MASK> paramount to a tribe \u2019 s receiving land in trust . <PARA> the tribe then asked the court for a stay of their <MASK> appeal of the taunton plaintiffs \u2019 lawsuit while they pursued a separate lawsuit against the doi to compel that agency to set aside their decision declaring the tribe ineligible to be granted land in trust . <PARA> \u201c in its decision , the department failed to apply established law , contorting some of the relevant facts and ignoring others to engineer a negative decision ,\u201d the tribe \u2019 s lawsuit <MASK> . \u201c as a result the department \u2019 s decision is arbitrary , capricious and contrary to law , and if left unaddressed , will have a <MASK> impact on the tribe .\u201d <PARA> interior department officials ultimately determined that the tribe was not under federal jurisdiction in 1934 , while the mashpee wampanoag contend they submitted \u201c mounds of <MASK> \u201d documenting that they were indeed under federal jurisdiction before 1934 . on 20 november 2018 , the doi asked the court for a 31 - day extension on a deadline to respond to the tribe \u2019 s lawsuit <PARA> even if the mashpee wampanoag were to prevail in their lawsuit against the doi , they would still have to succeed in their appeal of the taunton lawsuit holding that the land was improperly acquired by the interior department in the first place . on 9 october 2018 , the plantiffs \u2019 attorney filed a request arguing that the tribe should not be granted another stay in the appeal process . <PARA> in her op - ed , baird noted that although her ancestors shared a peaceful meal with pilgrims , the <MASK> often told about the <MASK> thanksgiving leaves out a less heartwarming aspect of american <MASK> :",

neutral \u201c scouts bsa \u201d in february 2019 . and a few days later , the bsa and the church of jesus christ of latter - day saints ( the mormon church ) jointly announced that the church would be ending their longstanding partnership with the organization in january 2020 . <PARA> these events prompted one right - wing web site to link the bsa \u2019 s recent moves towards gender and lgbt inclusivity with the mormon church \u2019 s decision to cut ties wuth scouting . on 9 may 2018 , the conservative tribune ( also known as western journal ) published a video which reported that : <PARA> technically , the bsa did not announce they were changing the name of their organization , but rather the name of the well - known \u201c boy scouts \u201d program ( for 11 - 17 year - olds ) to the gender - neutral \u201c scouts bsa .\u201d in a press release , chief scout executive michael surbaugh said that \u201c starting in february 2019 , the name of the older youth program will be \u2018 scouts bsa ,\u2019 and the name of our iconic organization will continue to be boy scouts of america .\u201d <PARA> according to the associated press , the mormon church contributes around 425 , 000 out of 2 . 3 million bsa members . if all of these members ultimately ended their participation in scouting , that would represent a loss of 18 . 5 percent of the bsa \u2019 s total membership , a very significant portion . <PARA> however , the church will continue their partnership with the bsa until 1 january 2020 . contrary to the conservative tribune \u2019 s headline , then , the scouts did not \u201c lose 425 , 000 boys one week after announcing name change ,\u201d though it appears they may lose that <MORE> members with obvious unease and caution . <PARA> the mormon church officially accepts openly gay and lesbian individuals as members and leaders , but only if they remain celibate , as the church \u2019 s web site notes : \u201c sexual relations between a man and woman who are not married , or between people of the same sex , violate one of our father in heaven \u2019 s most important laws and get in the way of our eternal progress .\u201d <PARA> when the bsa moved to accept gay and transgender members in recent years , the church obtained assurances from the scouts that the church could \u201c operate its programs in ways that are consistent with our standards and beliefs .\u201d <PARA> in january 2018 , the church ended their participation in two bsa programs for 14 - 20 year - olds , varsity and venturing , explaining that those programs had \u201c historically been difficult to implement within the church .\u201d ( venturing is a co - ed bsa program where older teenage boys and girls pursue more adventurous , outdoors activities together .) <PARA> however , in announcing the decision to end their participation in varsity and venturing , the church stipulated that it was unrelated to recent speculation about increased integration of girls and young women in the bsa : \u201c our decision to end our participation in the varsity and venturing programs was made independent of this possibility and before that time .\u201d <PARA> furthermore , while the church \u2019 s announcement of an end to their partnership with the bsa did come just days after the bsa announced they would be changing the name of the \u201c boy scouts \u201d program , a lengthy transition period will still occur between the two events . <PARA> the inclusion of girls in \u201c scouts bsa \u201d ( formerly the \u201c boy scouts \u201d program ) will begin in february 2019 . the mormon church and its members will continue to take part in bsa activities until january 2020 , a period of 11 months . <PARA> so if the church , in deciding to cut ties with the bsa , was objecting to the increased integration of girls , it does not appear to have been sufficiently bothered by it to prevent those 11 months of overlap . <PARA> ultimately , it \u2019 s not clear whether or to what extent the bsa \u2019 s moves towards increased inclusivity played a role in the mormon church \u2019 s decision to cut ties . unfortunately , the church has not clearly answered this question . <PARA> given the mormon church \u2019 s teachings on lgbt issues and the separate roles of men and woman , as well as their previous uneasy responses to boy scout announcements on inclusion , it has to be considered plausible that the bsa \u2019 s announcements might have played a role in the church \u2019 s decision to cut ties .",

        "text": "critics and observers of the american criminal justice system have long pointed to disparities and discrimination as one of its most significant and deeply - embedded problems . these disparities are perhaps most visible at the sentencing stage , where black individuals in particular are <MASK> proven to receive higher sentences \u2014 and for the same or similar crimes \u2014 than their white counterparts . <PARA> in that vein , in april 2018 the \u201c counter current news \u201d facebook page described the case of ramad chatman , in a widely - shared video . a voiceover narrates : <PARA> chatman \u2019 s case is a relatively complicated one , and the video gets most of the basic details right . however , it leaves out a crucial detail : the charge on which chatman was acquitted was not the same charge for which he was given a jail sentence , although the two cases were linked . <PARA> in july 2012 , 20 - year - old ramad ahshad chatman and three other men were charged with breaking into an apartment and stealing a television . chatman pleaded guilty , and floyd county superior court judge john niedrach agreed to deal with chatman under georgia \u2019 s first time offenders act and gave him five years \u2019 probation . this meant that , because chatman had not previously been convicted of a felony , he would avoid jail time and ultimately have the charges against him dismissed if he honored the terms of his probation . <PARA> in july 2014 , a clerk at the lucky lotto store on shorter avenue in rome , georgia was robbed at gunpoint by a black man . later that year , the store clerk saw chatman \u2019 s photograph on facebook and , convinced he was the man who robbed her , reported it to the police . the clerk positively identified chatman as the man who had robbed her at gunpoint . <PARA> in november 2015 , chatman became aware that he was a suspect in the lucky lotto robbery , and reported in person to police in rome , according to the atlanta , georgia nbc affiliate wxia - tv . he was arrested and charged with armed robbery . <PARA> in february 2016 , judge niedrach held a hearing on whether chatman had violated the terms of his probation on the 2012 theft . after hearing testimony from the lucky lotto store clerk , niedrach ruled that chatman had probably committed the lucky lotto armed robbery and thereby violated the terms of his probation . niedrach revoked chatman \u2019 s first - offender probation , which triggered an automatic conviction on the 2012 theft charges . <PARA> niedrach sentenced chatman to a ten - year prison sentence for the 2012 theft . because chatman had already spent four years on probation , niedrach suspended this portion of the sentence , effectively meaning chatman would spend six years in prison with his release provisionally scheduled for 2022 . <PARA> a jury acquitted chatman of armed robbery in the lucky lotto case in may 2016 . according to the rome news - tribune , chatman \u2019 s attorneys filed an emergency motion for niedrach to reconsider his revocation of chatman \u2019 s probation , since the judge \u2019 s ruling on the probation was based on his conclusion that chatman probably committed the lucky lotto armed robbery and a jury had just acquitted chatman of that charge . however , niedrach did not agree to reconsider his decision , because the jury trial \u2014 although it came to a different conclusion about chatman \u2019 s guilt \u2014 did not bring forth any new <MASK> . <PARA> judge niedrach appears to have acted according to the relevant georgia law , which <MASK> that a judge may revoke an individual \u2019 s probation either if that individual admits to violating one of the terms of their probation , or if in the judge \u2019 s opinion \u201c the <MASK> produced at the revocation hearing establishes by a preponderance of the <MASK> the violation or violations alleged .\u201d <PARA> the judge indicated in floyd county superior court documents that there was \u201c <MASK> by a preponderance of <MASK> \u201d that chatman had committed the armed robbery and that he had been in possession of a gun . this violated two conditions of his probation : that chatman would not \u201c violate the criminal laws of any governmental unit ;\u201d or \u201c receive , possess or transport any firearm or other offensive weapon .\u201d <PARA> in other words , in 2016 niedrach came to the conclusion that , on balance , the <MASK> mostly pointed towards chatman committing a crime and being in possession of a firearm in 2014 , and that was enough to revoke his probation and trigger his conviction and imprisonment on the 2012 charge . chatman was not jailed for the same charge on which he was acquitted , something that the counter current news video does not clarify , misleadingly <MASK> he was jailed \u201c even though he was found not guilty .\u201d <PARA> similarly , when the video \u2019 s narrator says chatman \u201c never broke the terms of his probation ,\u201d this denies viewers the full facts . although a jury acquitted chatman of the 2014 armed robbery , judge niedrach , in accordance with the procedures set out in georgia law , found that chatman had indeed broken two of the terms of his probation . <PARA> as of may 2018 , chatman remains incarcerated at rogers <MASK> prison in reidsville , georgia . his provisional release date is 6 july 2022 .",

was there really a 3 . 36 - fold increased risk for autism in african - american males who received mmr vaccination before the age of 36 months in this dataset ? hooker [ performed ] multiple subset analyses , which , of course , are prone to <MASK> positives . as we say , if you slice and dice the <MASK> more and more finely , eventually you will find apparent correlations that might or might not be real . in this case , i doubt hooker \u2019 s correlation is real . <PARA> there \u2019 s no biologically plausible reason why there would be an effect observed in african - americans but no other race and , more specifically than that , in african - american males . in the discussion , hooker does a bunch of handwaving about lower vitamin d levels and the like in african american boys , but there really isn \u2019 t a biologically plausible mechanism to account for his observation , suggesting that it \u2019 s probably spurious . there are multiple other studies , many much larger than this one , that failed to find a correlation between mmr and autism . <PARA> what [ hooker ] has done , apparently , is found grist for a perfect conspiracy theory to demonize the cdc , play the race card in a truly despicable fashion , and cast fear , uncertainty , and doubt about the cdc vaccination program , knowing that most of the white antivaccine activists who support [ him ] hate the cdc so much that they won \u2019 t notice that even hooker \u2019 s reanalysis doesn \u2019 t support their belief that vaccines caused the autism in their children .",

however , the tract of catastrophic damage torn through a person \u2019 s internal blood vessels , tissue , and bone by a high - velocity ar - 15 round could plausibly have around the same diameter as the \u201c black hole \u201d in the poster . <PARA> finally , it is unlikely that an ar - 15 exit wound would have the same dimensions as the \u201c black hole \u201d shown in the poster , but it is possible . the bullet would have to travel through the body in such a way that it fragmented bone and tissue to the extent that all that matter was forced out of the body along with the bullet itself , creating an exceptionally large exit wound .",

        "text": "<MASK> : in the long career of actor , screenwriter , and film director sylvester stallone , he is best known for portraying two iconic movie characters in multiple films : the boxer rocky balboa and the soldier of fortune john rambo . despite all that has been written and discussed regarding stallone \u2019 s personal life during the years since those roles propelled him to hollywood stardom , we \u2019 ve found little mention by stallone himself of the role religion has played in his life . <PARA> in late 2006 , while promoting the release of his film rocky balboa , sylvester stallone undertook some interviews with religious news media ( such as one with pat robertson for the christian broadcasting network ) in which he discussed his faith , and in an <PARA> <MASK> published by the catholic news service , stallone <MASK> that he \u201c grew up catholic , stopped going to church after he tasted fame and fortune , but now considers himself a churchgoing catholic again ,\u201d the latter aspect spurred by medical issues his daughter sophia had experienced several years earlier : <PARA> stallone tried to find the words to describe what brought about his self - imposed exile from catholicism . \u201c i don \u2019 t know . life ,\u201d he said . \u201c your career is going , you \u2019 re not communicating with your family .\u201d the weight of celebrity was \u201c very heavy ,\u201d he added . \u201c i didn \u2019 t have any strong foundation behind me of people that would keep my feet on the ground . i was extremely seduced by the newfound freedom .\u201d <PARA> things started turning around for stallone , he said , before his marriage in 1997 to his third and current wife , jennifer flavin . \u201c when i got married everything changed ,\u201d he said . \u201c when my daughter was born sick , and i realized i really needed some help here , i started putting everything in god \u2019 s hands , his omnipotence , his all - forgivingness .\u201d stallone added that being catholic \u201c puts me where i should be . i was alone in the world . i thought i would have to handle things in my own way .\u201d but then \u201c i thought if i put myself in jesus \u2019 hands and asked for insight and guidance i am basically taking the yoke off of me and using his intelligence and wisdom to make the proper decision ,\u201d he said . <PARA> however , although in that round of interviews sylvester stallone made reference to \u201c putting himself in jesus \u2019 hands \u201d in seeking insight and guidance for dealing with his daughter \u2019 s illness , he didn \u2019 t publicly announce that he had \u201c surrendered his life to the lord jesus christ .\u201d moreover , those interviews took place over nine years ago , and stallone has since contradicted some of the expressions of religiosity he made back in 2006 in more recent interviews . <PARA> for example , during a september 2010 interview with gq magazine , stallone said that although he was baptized catholic and considered himself \u201c spiritual ,\u201d he did not \u201c belong to a structured church \u201d: <PARA> a : i \u2019 m pretty spiritual ; i believe a lot in the spirit of man . i \u2019 m certainly not an atheist . i was baptized catholic , but i don \u2019 t belong to a structured church . i have no opposition to it . i think there \u2019 s great nuggets of knowledge in there , some wonderful rules to live by . then the flip side is the amount of agony that \u2019 s caused , which is , excuse me ? <PARA> q : do you ever have any concerns about your own mortality ? <PARA> a : i don \u2019 t believe that we go anyplace . you make your heaven and hell right here , and you are what you leave behind . but don \u2019 t think that you \u2019 re going to change anything ; you \u2019 re not . <PARA> so even if sylvester stallone may have described himself as a \u201c churchgoing catholic \u201d once again in 2006 , by the end of 2010 he had <MASK> that he didn \u2019 t belong to any \u201c structured church \u201d at all . <PARA> thus it was somewhat surprising when the item reproduced above began circulating via social media in august 2013 , <MASK> that sylvester stallone \u201c has surrendered his life to the lord jesus christ , and announced it to the public several days ago \u201d \u2014 it made no sense other than as a recirculated or out - of - date reference to comments stallone had made about his return to catholicism back in the 1990s and not as a report of any current event . ( it \u2019 s also unclear how sylvester stallone could have made a \u201c public announcement \u201d that managed to escape the attention of all the world \u2019 s news media and the internet save for one second - hand account of it .) <PARA> in response to our own query of august 2013 , mr . stallone \u2019 s publicity representatives told us the <MASK> <MASK> that mr . stallone \u201c had given over his life to the lord jesus christ \u201d was \u201c wrong .\u201d",

        "text": "in september 2018 , with most political debate and news coverage focused on the controversial nomination of judge brett kavanaugh to the u . s . supreme court , the u . s . congress faced the prospect of allowing a major piece of legislation to expire . <PARA> the violence against women act ( vawa ) was first proposed by then - senator joe biden in 1993 and signed into law in 1994 . it provided significant federal funding for services offered to survivors of domestic and sexual violence , created the office on violence against women within the justice department , enhanced the training of law enforcement officers in the area of sexual and domestic violence , and strengthened penalties for certain sexual crimes , most notably requiring perpetrators of sexual violence to pay restitution to their victims . <PARA> the act , which comprises several constitutive laws , has been reauthorized every few years since 1994 with adjustments and additions being made on each occasion , most notably in 2013 when \u2014 after an unusually long party - line battle in congress \u2014 the protections and provisions in the vawa were extended to same - sex couples . <PARA> the act had been scheduled to expire on sept . 30 , 2018 , prompting concerns that women , children , and men who are vulnerable to domestic and sexual violence would no longer be protected by the the funding , services and legal provisions associated with the vawa . <PARA> on oct . 1 , the democratic candidate for new york attorney general , tish james <MASK> on twitter that president donald trump \u2019 s administration had \u201c let the violence against women act expire without saying a word \u201d: <PARA> james \u2019 <MASK> was retweeted thousands of times and prompted inquiries from our readers about its veracity . <PARA> in fact , the vawa was not allowed to expire on sept . 30 , 2018 , either by the trump administration or members of congress . james acknowledged this fact herself in a follow - up tweet in which she wrote : <PARA> on sept . 26 , five days before james \u2019 tweet , the house of representatives voted through house bill 6157 , an appropriations bill which provided funding through the 2019 financial year for the department of defense and other government departments , as well as an eclectic mix of several smaller measures , including spending related to the vawa . the relevant section of that bill read as follows : \u201c any program , authority , or provision , including any pilot program , authorized under the violence against women reauthorization act of 2013 shall continue in effect through the date specified in section 105 ( 3 ) of this act [ 7 december 2018 .]\u201d <PARA> on sept . 28 , president trump signed h . r . 6157 into law , thus extending the provisions of the vawa until dec . 7 . he did not mention the vawa in either of his public <MASK> about the appropriations bill . <PARA> however , congress failed to reauthorize the vawa and it expired in december 2018 . another short - term spending bill extended the provisions of the act until feb . 15 , 2019 , when it expired for a second time . repeated attempts to reauthorize since then have failed . the american bar association reported in may 2019 that : <PARA> as of november , however , the reauthorization bill appeared dead in the water after bipartisan talks fell apart in the senate . roll call reported that sen . jodi ernst , r - iowa , was set to introduce her own version of the bill , which she said would be able to pass the republican - controlled senate and gain president trump \u2019 s support .",

        "text": "<MASK> : contrary to its modern image as one of the most stable and long - running dramas to air during radio \u2019 s golden age , the early days of the lone ranger were somewhat hectic , with four different actors voicing the title role during the show \u2019 s first few months on the air in 1933 . the <MASK> ranger was a man named george stenius , who left the role after two and a half months to pursue a career as a writer in new york . ( as george seaton , he would go on to a career in hollywood as a screenwriter - director - producer , winning two academy awards for his screenplays along the way .) stenius was replaced by actor jack deeds , who lasted only a few days before being dismissed as ill - suited for the job . james jewell , the <MASK> \u2019 s dramatic director , filled in for one performance before hiring earle graser , who took over as the lone ranger on 18 april 1933 . <PARA> earle graser was the lone ranger on radio for the next eight years , a dedicated professional whose voice became indelibly associated with the image of the character he portrayed : <PARA> a truly mild - mannered man in real life , [ graser ] was radio \u2019 s real - life clark kent . the microphone was his phone booth . there he shone . there he made everyone believe . you heard that great deep voice and you knew that there really was a mysterious masked rider out there somewhere . there really was a lone ranger . <PARA> earle graser \u2019 s tenure as the actor behind the image of the daring and resourceful masked rider of the plains came to an abrupt end when tragedy struck on the morning of 8 april 1941 : graser fell asleep at the wheel of his car and was killed when it slammed into a parked trailer . ( contrary to some versions of this <MASK> , there was no suggestion in the press that graser had died in a \u201c disgraceful way \u201d by driving while intoxicated , thereby necessitating a cover - up of his death .) <PARA> graser \u2019 s death presented several immediate problems to the lone ranger \u2019 s producers . the first was that a new actor for the lead role had to be found very quickly , as the show aired live three days a week , with no reruns or pre - recorded broadcasts to fall back upon . another issue was that the serial needed to avoid an abrupt transition in slotting another actor into the title role : it wouldn \u2019 t do to have listeners who had grown familiar with one particular voice for the lone ranger over the course of several years notice that he suddenly sounded very different from one day to the next . <MORE> suggested the part be filled by brace beemer , an announcer and studio manager who had at times narrated the lone ranger program , had been making personal appearances as the lone ranger since the show \u2019 s early days ( because he was much more visually suited to the role than graser ), and was currently playing the lead in challenge of the yukon ( which only aired once a week and therefore presented less of a problem with role identification ). <PARA> brace beemer \u2019 s voice was noticeably deeper than earl graser \u2019 s , however , so the lone ranger \u2018 s producers had to come up with some way of gradually easing him into the role in order to avoid an abrupt transition that might stigmatize beemer as a mere replacement . the stratagem finally decided upon was a five - part transition series in which a bed - ridden lone ranger struggled to recover from gunshot wounds that rendered him unable to speak . for five episodes in 1941 ( april 9 through april 18 ), the lone ranger whispered , breathed , grunted , and communicated with tonto through notes scrawled in pencil as he recuperated with the aid of an army surgeon . meanwhile , tonto faithfully followed his instructions to \u201c ride for us both \u201d and continually assured the audience that the lone ranger would be back in the saddle again one day : <PARA> the transition series served its dual purpose of convincing children that , despite what they may have heard on the news , the lone ranger was not dead , and of providing a bridge to beemer \u2019 s assumption of a full - voiced lone ranger role . when the lone ranger recovered from his injuries and resumed undertaking his usual adventures ( as well as talking again ), maybe some listeners noticed his voice was significantly deeper and richer than before . but it had been a few weeks since they had last heard him speak , and with no reruns available through which the audience might compare his current vocal sound with his previous one , it was natural enough for the difference to be chalked up to inconstant memory and / or the implication that the change was an outgrowth of the lone ranger \u2019 s gradual return to health and strength . <PARA> any concerns about a drop - off in the popularity of the lone ranger were quickly laid to rest , and within six months the serial began the longest \u2014 and to many listeners , the best \u2014 adventure of the lone ranger \u2019 s career , a five - month <MASK> arc in which the masked man took on the nefarious legion of the black arrow . brace beemer was the voice of the lone ranger for the next thirteen years , until the radio series ended with its last live broadcast on 3 september 1954 .",

        "text": "in april 2006 , the experience of a 14 - year - old who had eaten pancakes made from a mix that had gone moldy was described in the popular newspaper column dear abby . the account has since been circulated widely on the internet as scores of concerned homemakers ponder the safety of the pancake and other baking mixes lurking in their larders : <PARA> there is truth in this tale , yet its inherent warning is overblown . in a nutshell , staledated pancake and other baking mixes pose no danger to you unless : <PARA> how old the mix is has no bearing on its safety \u2014 a mix that is well within its freshness date yet has come to contain mold spores could prove fatal to someone with a mold allergy , while one that is a year or two beyond its \u201c best use by \u201d date but did not contain mold spores would be perfectly safe . <PARA> while we cannot vet the incident described by \u201c sue in wyantskill \u201d involving her 14 - year - old son , the underlying <MASK> is demonstrably <MASK> \u2014 it is possible for someone who chows down on pancakes made from a mix that has sat around too long to suffer a potentially fatal anaphylactic reaction to the molds that have grown therein . we know this to be so because it has happened before , and the resultant death was documented . <PARA> in 2001 , two pathologists practicing in charleston , south carolina , reported on an unnamed 19 - year - old who died in such a manner . while home on vacation from college , the victim , a young man with a <MASK> of allergies ( including mold ), polished off two pancakes made from a packaged mix that had sat open in a kitchen cabinet for about two years \u2014 even though his two friends stopped eating their portions , complaining that the griddlecakes tasted like rubbing alcohol . very quickly thereafter , while watching television , the ill - fated collegian experienced shortness of breath that was not relieved by his inhaler . he asked his friends to take him to a clinic not far from the home , and he was reported to have turned a bit blue from lack of oxygen ( i . e ., became cyanotic ) during the ride . while he did manage to walk into the clinic on his own , once inside he suddenly collapsed in cardiopulmonary arrest . he failed to respond to resuscitative efforts and was pronounced dead . <PARA> the cause of his death was determined to be anaphylaxis due to an allergic reaction to molds . <PARA> anaphylaxis is a rapidly developing immunologic reaction that occurs when those who have allergies come in contact with the substances they are allergic to . when it kills , it does so by triggering fatal respiratory or cardiac arrest . <PARA> the pancake mix that delivered a toxic payload was analyzed and found to contain four rather nasty molds : penicillium , fusarium , mucor , and aspergillus . the decedent had not been allergic to eggs ( which are a component of pancakes ), so there was no doubt as to which allergy had killed him . it had been mold , and nothing but . <PARA> there was a death , and it had been due to ancient pancake mix . or , rather , to an allergic reaction to the mold that had grown in the stale pancake mix . <PARA> it needs be kept in mind there is nothing inherently toxic about pancake mix that has passed its freshness date ; the product \u2019 s aging does not transform it into a poison , nor does the growth of mold within opened boxes of flapjack powder turn it into something that will fell all who ingest it . only those who have allergies to mold are at risk , and even then , for the pancake mix to pose a hazard it has to contain mold spores , not just be over the hill . <PARA> in october 2008 the pancake mix warning was expanded to include cake , biscuit , and brownie mixes . <PARA> unlike what the e - mailed caution would have folks believe , there is nothing magical about yeast which causes it to \u201c over time develop spores .\u201d <PARA> for mold to gain access to a food product , the foodstuff has to be exposed to its spores . pancake mix cocooned in an unbleached wax paper , plastic , or a foil pouch within its outer packaging wouldn \u2019 t have this contact and should still be safe no matter how old it gets . however , mix sold unpouched in cardboard boxes or paper sacks would likely be at risk even if the box or sack hadn \u2019 t previously been opened , because such packaging would not necessarily keep dampness out , and mold thrives in damp environments . <PARA> what does all this mean ? if you don \u2019 t have a mold allergy , you needn \u2019 t fear your pancake mix ; if you do have such a sensitivity , you shouldn \u2019 t keep your flapjack makings around for a few years after opening the box or pouch it came in . it \u2019 s not worth dying over 50 \u00a2 worth of pancake mix , so when in doubt , throw it out .",

<PARA> there was an off duty county deputy at the theater . she pulled out her gun and shot the man 4 times before he had a chance to kill anyone . so since this <MASK> makes the point that the best thing to stop a bad person with a gun is a good person with a gun , the media is treating it like it never happened . <PARA> only the local media covered it . the city is giving her a medal next week . <PARA> <MASK> : according to news accounts , on the evening of 16 december 2012 , a 19 - year - old man named jesus manuel garcia showed up at the china garden restaurant in san antonio with a gun in an incident believed to have something to do with his former girlfriend ( who worked at the restaurant ). after garcia opened fire at the restaurant , he pursued a number of employees who had fled across a parking lot to an adjacent theater , where he was eventually stopped by an off - duty law enforcement officer who was working as a guard at the theater : <PARA> the employees inside the restaurant fled out a side door into the parking lot . investigators said garcia began chasing the employees and continued firing at them as they ran through the parking lot and into the mayan palace theatre next door . <PARA> as garcia was running through the parking lot , he shot the windshield of a san antonio police patrol car after an officer in the car shined a spotlight on him . the <PARA> officer was not injured . <PARA> garcia then ran inside the movie theater , where he continued his search for the restaurant employees . movie - goers in the lobby , bathroom , and some theaters reported hearing multiple gunshots . the gunshots caused people inside the theater to panic . <PARA> \u201c everybody was just coming out of the side of the theater , running out the emergency exits . and everyone was screaming and running ,\u201d a woman who was at the theater said . <PARA> authorities said one person was shot by garcia . <PARA> garcia was finally stopped by an off - duty bexar county <MORE> , yelled for people inside the theater to get down on the ground . when garcia came out of the restroom , castellano ordered him to drop his weapon . when he refused , she shot him multiple times . <PARA> \u201c i \u2019 m not going to lie ; it was frightening ,\u201d she said . \u201c but , you know , the training kicks in . and thank you to the sheriff \u2019 s office for all of the training that we \u2019 re given .\u201d <PARA> bexar county sheriff amadeo ortiz presented the 13 - year veteran with the medal of valor for taking down a gunman inside a south - side movie theater . <PARA> according to police and deputies at the scene , 19 - year - old jesus garcia ran into the santikos mayan palace after firing several shots inside a nearby restaurant [ and ] in the parking lot . <PARA> castellano , who was off duty , yelled for people inside the theater to get down on the ground . when garcia came out of the restroom , castellano ordered him to drop his weapon . when he refused , she shot him multiple times . <PARA> \u201c i \u2019 m not going to lie ; it was frightening ,\u201d she said . \u201c but , you know , the training kicks in . and thank you to the sheriff \u2019 s office for all of the training that we \u2019 re given .\u201d <PARA> some of the details in the example at the head of this <MASK> appear to be inaccurate : news reports indicate garcia didn \u2019 t shoot his ex - girlfriend ( she wasn \u2019 t even present at the restaurant at the time ), and it isn \u2019 t yet clear whether he was deliberately intending to shoot innocent victims at the theater ( as the gunman did in the july 2012 aurora , colorado , theater shootings ) or whether he was firing aimlessly in a fit of rage . <PARA> in general , the san antonio theater shooting received little coverage outside of local news media , primarily because it didn \u2019 t include any of the factors that typically propel such stories from local to national news : it was not an especially horrific crime ( or part of a larger crime ), it did not involve any deaths or the wounding of large numbers of people , and it featured no prominent persons : it was a shooting incident in which a single person was injured . the possibility that an armed guard may have prevented additional casualties by shooting the gunman might have made the incident more newsworthy than usual , but that aspect of the <MASK> was speculative , and as others have observed , the news media tend to highlight negative events rather than positive ones : \u201c reporters don \u2019 t report buildings that don \u2019 t burn .\u201d",

related property damage insurance <MASK> ( including flood damage ) will have to give their insurance company 61 days \u2019 notice before initiating litigation . <PARA> according to an analysis published by the independent house research organization in the texas house of representatives : <PARA> the second major provision in hb 1774 is that it imposes a <MASK> recovery threshold in order for individuals to recover the full amount of their attorney \u2019 s fees , if they decide to go to court . if , in the event of a lawsuit , a jury decides to award a plaintiff 80 percent or more of the amount they are <MASK> , then all that individual \u2019 s attorney \u2019 s fees will be covered . if a jury decides to award 20 percent or less , none of their attorney \u2019 s fees are covered : <PARA> we consulted two experts on insurance : etti baranoff , an associate professor of finance at virginia commonwealth university and a former regulator at the texas department of insurance , and dalit baranoff , a historian of insurance policy who runs the risks and consequences blog . <PARA> they told us the bill is designed to discourage consumers from taking a <MASK> to court and filing exaggerated <MASK> , but otherwise doesn \u2019 t change the process of settling <MASK> out of court . <PARA> this is where the 61 - day waiting period comes into play , which the <MORE> benefit to homeowners in filing a written <MASK> before 1 september 2017 : <PARA> again , however , this benefit only accrues if the homeowner later decides to sue the insurance company . <PARA> under current law , pierce says , an insurance company would have to pay 18 percent interest on whatever they owed in the event that a consumer successfully sues them for a delayed payment . under the new law , she points out , companies would have to pay a lower rate of interest arrived at by adding 5 percent to the interest rate determined under sec . 304 . 003 , financial code ( sec . 2c ). <PARA> so there is a potential benefit in filing a <MASK> before 1 september 2017 , but only if you then later file a successful lawsuit in the event of a dispute over your payment . <PARA> conclusion <PARA> the new law will not have a direct effect on insurance <MASK> that are settled out of court , and most insurance <MASK> are settled out of court . however , the law could make it slower and more difficult for homeowners to get paid what they believe they are owed if they start litigation after 1 september 2017 . it will also make suing insurance companies more financially risky . <PARA> if a consumer were to file a lawsuit against their insurance company before 1 september , they could experience a significant benefit from having done so . however , if their home has been extensively damaged just before 1 september 2017 ( by historically catastrophic flooding , for example ), it is extremely unlikely they would be able , practically speaking , to find and hire an attorney and file a suit before 1 september . <PARA> they would also have to have a reasonable basis to sue \u2014 a dispute over their <MASK> , or an insurance company \u2019 s refusal to pay , for example \u2014 a process that there simply wasn \u2019 t time for between the arrival of tropical storm harvey on 26 august and the enactment of the new law on 1 september . <PARA> the only potential benefit from filing a <MASK> before 1 september is that if someone later decides to sue the insurance company and wins , the company will be obliged to pay them the higher , pre - september rate of interest on what they owe . <PARA> the <MASK> contained in viral facebook posts on 27 august 2017 are a largely accurate description of the provisions of hb 1774 , but they do lack important context and do not make it clear to readers that the law only affects how <MASK> are dealt with in the event that someone decides to sue an insurance company . these posts do not include that most insurance <MASK> are settled out of court , and will therefore not be directly affected by the change in the law .",

and although the task force might conceivably recommend some restrictions that would affect recreational fishing of particular species and / or in particular waters , the notion that recreational fishing in the u . s . is set to be banned entirely is an exceedingly far - fetched one . the task force \u2019 s interim report of september 2009 contained nothing that could reasonably be interpreted as suggesting such a ban was in the offing . <PARA> espn subsequently issued an editor \u2019 s update to the editorial that <MASK> touched off the \u201c fishing ban \u201d brouhaha : <PARA> espnoutdoors . com inadvertently contributed to a flare - up when we posted the latest <MASK> in a series of stories on president barack obama \u2019 s newly created ocean policy task force , a column written by robert montgomery , a conservation writer for bass since 1985 . regrettably , we made several errors in the editing and presentation of this installment . though our series has included numerous news stories on the topic , this was not one of them \u2014 it was an opinion piece , and should have been clearly labeled as commentary . <PARA> and while our series overall has examined several sides of the topic , this particular column was not properly balanced and failed to represent contrary points of view . we have reached out to people on every side of the issue and reported their points of view \u2014 if they chose to respond \u2014 throughout the series , but failed to do so in this specific column . <PARA> and while our series overall has examined several sides of the topic , this particular column was not properly balanced and failed to represent contrary points of view . we have reached out to people on every side of the issue and reported their points of view \u2014 if they chose to respond \u2014 throughout the series , but failed to do so in this specific column .",

        "text": "for those looking for a quick answer to the question of whether the above narrative is literally <MASK> , we \u2019 ll <MASK> up front that it is not . nothing remotely like the account related above appears in any biography or <MASK> about albert einstein , nor is the account congruent with that scientist \u2019 s expressed views on the subject of religion ( in which he generally described himself as an \u201c agnostic \u201d or a \u201c religious nonbeliever \u201d). einstein \u2019 s name has simply been inserted into an anecdote created long after his death in order to provide the reading audience with a recognizable figure and thus lend the tale an air of verisimilitude <PARA> as to what this account says from a standpoint of faith , one of the most troubling conundrums is the question of how evil and suffering can survive in a universe created and managed by a loving supreme being . postulated explanations of this paradox are known as theodicies , and such answers have been for centuries handed out by members of many belief systems when challenged to provide logical answers to the question of how it is possible that a just and moral god can co - exist with evil . among these answers are : <PARA> the online forward <MASK> above draws upon yet another possible explanation : that evil is the absence of god , in the same way that cold is the absence of heat , and dark is the absence of light . this argument has been around for a long time , as has the legend about the pious student <PARA> using it to squelch an atheist professor . <PARA> the name of einstein gets used in legends whose plots call for a smart person , one whom the audience will immediately recognize as such ( i . e ., modern tellings of an ancient legend about a learned rabbi who switches places with his servant feature albert einstein in the role of esteemed scholar ). this venerated cultural icon has , at least in the world of contemporary lore , become a stock character to be tossed into the fray wherever the script calls for a genius . <PARA> likewise , \u201c the atheist professor \u201d is a stock figure common to a number of urban legends and anecdotes of the faithful : he gets flung into the mix where there \u2019 s a need for someone to play the role of science vanquished in science - versus - religion tales . but he is not inserted merely to serve as an icon of learning to be humbled in tales that aim to teach that faith is of greater value than provable knowledge ; he is also woven into these sorts of stories for his lack of belief . just as the villain in <PARA> oldtime melodramas had to have a waxed moustache , a black cape , and an evil laugh , so <MORE> one putting the boots to the other . <PARA> \u201c the atheist professor \u201d plays his expected role of getting his pants kicked in the dropped chalk tale , where he ( once again ) challenges his browbeaten students on the topic of god \u2019 s existence . he is also pivotal to these following tales , which are yet other variations on the same theme : <PARA> the key to understanding the allure of these tales lies in this one line from the \u201c evil is the absence of god \u201d <MASK> : \u201c the professor was quite pleased with himself and boasted to the students that he had proven once more that the christian faith was a myth .\u201d <PARA> faith can \u2019 t be proved ( or disproved ); if such validations were possible , those concepts would stop being matters of faith and start being matters of fact . unfortunately , this leaves those who are convinced of the existence of god without an incontrovertible , irrefutable answer to those who challenge them to provide <MASK> of the veracity of their belief systems \u2019 tenets , or to demonstrate beyond any shadow of doubt that their inner direction is the right one to those who insist on independently verifiable <MASK> of that which can \u2019 t be proved . <PARA> that god permits evil to exist ( and some would say to thrive ) is taken by non - believers as an inarguable sign that there is no supreme being . this puzzle is pointed to by them as the unanswerable fallacy that proves the negative : they reckon that a loving , all - powerful god would have stamped out evil , ergo he doesn \u2019 t exist , or he is not all - powerful , or he is not all that enamored of his children . as such , this paradox can be disquieting to those who do believe : not only do they themselves have to wrestle with the seeming disconnect , they are left unable to convincingly answer their critics when this topic comes up . they find themselves similarly hamstrung when pressed to prove the existence of god . <PARA> stories about atheist professors being bested by <MASK> believers who did have answers at the ready are both ventings of this frustration and expressions of delight in finally seeming to have been armed with deft responses to fling back . these are tales of affirmation , modern - day parables of trials overcome and fierce adversaries bested by those who held fast to what they believed in , even in the face of ridicule rained down by authority figures . like parables , they are meant to inspire similar resolve in those with whom they are shared : should those members of the flock ever find themselves in like circumstances , they should feel moved to emulate the brave students of legend who stood up to the atheist professors .",

        "text": "<MASK> : this item <PARA> is another case where someone has taken a genuine photograph and added a humorous ( but fictitious ) explanation to it . <PARA> picture comes from the fiesta de san ferm\u00edn , a festival held every year between 6 july and 14 july in pamplona , spain , to commemorate san ferm\u00edn , a 3rd - century saint who was martyred in being dragged through the streets of pamplona by bulls . one of the highlights of the festival \u2014 and the event most well - known to the rest of the world ( due in large part to its popularization through the writings of ernest hemingway ) \u2014 is the encierro , known in english as the \u201c running of the bulls .\u201d <PARA> each day \u2019 s san ferm\u00edn festivities include afternoon bullfights , and at 8 a . m . every morning the bulls to be used in that afternoon \u2019 s fights are set loose from a corral and herded about a half - mile through the cobbled streets of the town for a three - to four - minute run to the plaza de toros bullfighting stadium . many festival celebrants ( mostly young males ) choose to demonstrate their courage and physical prowess by donning white garb , tying red handkerchiefs about their necks , and running ahead of the group of charging bulls for as long as they can . others opt for somewhat safer ways to experience the thrill of participation : running only a very short portion of the course , running behind the bulls , standing in the street and ducking safely into doorways just as the bulls run past , or simply lining the streets for close - up views of the proceedings .

poison ?) <PARA> it \u2019 s a sadness that a holiday so thoroughly and greedily enjoyed by kids is being sanitized out of existence in the name of safety . sadder still is there appears to be little reason for it . <PARA> though we \u2019 ve yet to find <MASK> of a genuine halloween poisoning , we have uncovered a few isolated incidents initially reported as random poisonings that , upon further investigation , turned out to be something else . <PARA> let \u2019 s set the criteria for what constitutes a halloween poisoning and then examine the famous and not - so - famous cases often pointed to as examples of this horror : <PARA> by far the most famous case of halloween candy poisoning was the murder of eight - year - old timothy marc o \u2019 bryan at the hands of his father , ronald clark o \u2019 bryan , in houston , texas . the child died at 10 p . m . on 31 october 1974 , as a result of eating cyanide - laced pixie stix acquired while trick - or - treating . <PARA> to make his act appear more like the work of a random madman , o \u2019 bryan also gave poisoned pixie stix to his daughter and three other children . by a kind stroke of fate , none of the other children ate the candy . <PARA> the prosecution proved the father had purchased cyanide and had ( along with a neighbor ) accompanied the group of children on their door - to - door mission . none of the places visited that night were giving out pixie stix . young mark \u2019 s life was insured for a large sum of money , and collecting on this policy has always been pointed to as the motive behind this murder . <PARA> though the case was circumstantial ( no one saw the father poison the candy or slip the pixie stix into the boy \u2019 s bag ), ronald o \u2019 bryan was convicted of the murder in may 1975 . he received the death sentence and was executed by lethal injection on 31 march 1984 ( not on the poetically - just <MORE> on the <MASK> and scared the bejeezus out of everyone yet again with tales of a poisoner on the loose . <PARA> in 2001 , four - year - old tiffaney troung of vancouver died a day after ingesting candy she picked up trick - or - treating on halloween . police reacted by issuing an alert to area parents to dump whatever goodies their kids had collected . the cause of death was ultimately pegged as non - contagious sepsis - causing streptococcus bacteria ( which can cause everything from strep throat to flesh - eating disease ). the halloween candy tiffaney ate played no part in her death . <PARA> an odd act of randomness occurred in the town of hercules , california ( near san francisco ) in 2000 . some trick - or - treaters came home with little packets of marijuana done up to look like miniature snickers bars . parents of the kids who received this beneficence quickly contacted the police , who just as quickly traced the giveaway to a particular house . there , a mystified homeowner was confronted about the find . police investigated and were satisfied the homeowner had no knowledge of the special contents of certain bars that were handed out that night . <PARA> the marijuana packets dressed up to look like snickers bars had landed in the hercules dead letter office because whoever had tried to mail a package containing them either didn \u2019 t use enough postage or had listed an incorrect address . a postal employee ( the mystified homeowner ) charged with transporting the bars plus various canned goods that had accumulated in the dead letter office to a local charity kept the candy for his own use . he brought the \u201c candy \u201d home to give out on halloween , thinking the snickers bars were , well , snickers bars . the \u201c trick \u201d ended up being on him . <PARA> putting the crazed halloween poisoner <MASK> to rest can be quite the task , as was outlined in a 9 november 1989 <MASK> in the los angeles times . the following is an excerpt from an interview with joel best , a professor of sociology at california <MASK> university , fresno , who has been trying to debunk this urban legend for more than thirty years : <PARA> sad to say , foreign objects hidden in halloween loot are part of the trick - or - treat experience , but these incidents are few and far between , and our fear of them is greatly out of proportion with the likelihood of their occurring . acting on this out - of - control fear , some hospitals and police departments have taken to x - raying bags of halloween plunder , as noted in the 31 october 1993 washington post : <PARA> sightings : this legend appears in a 1986 jack chick tract about the satanic influences of halloween .",

( the show was aired live and no tape of it exists , so a verbatim transcription of what sales actually said is not available .) <PARA> complaints from outraged parents came fast and furious , and the television <MASK> that hosted sales \u2019 program , wnew - tv in new york , had pulled him off the air by the following monday . ( contrary to common belief , sales wasn \u2019 t fired over the stunt , nor was his show canceled because of it : he resumed broadcasting two weeks later , and his program ran on wnew for almost another two years .) <PARA> it \u2019 s easy for those who weren \u2019 t around back then to be puzzled by the frenzied response to what now seems like a tepid , impulsive gag at worst , but back in 1965 plenty of adults were livid at the thought of a tv personality \u2019 s crassly manipulating children for commercial gain . as many of sales \u2019 supporters maintained , though , soupy hadn \u2019 t really done anything that radio and television pitchmen hadn \u2019 t already been doing for years : he had simply cut out the middleman by suggesting that children send him money directly rather than exhorting them to buy his sponsors \u2019 products . hadn \u2019 t his radio predecessors been just as commercially manipulative when they continually touted the charms of various mediocre products to children , who then pestered their mothers to buy those products solely because the purchases were necessary to obtain a shake - up mug or code - o - graph or whatever geegaw was being plugged on popular kids \u2019 shows like little orphan annie and captain midnight ? <PARA> if cooler heads had prevailed back in 1965 , adults might have realized that the furor was much ado about nothing . the premise of soupy \u2019 s stunt was largely untenable , because it required that children mostly too young to understand or appreciate the concept of \u201c money \u201d would nonetheless be able to recognize it , surreptitiously remove it from their parents \u2019 wallets , put it in envelopes with the correct postage and address ( even though soupy hadn \u2019 t provided an address ), and mail it to him , all without their parents \u2019 knowledge or assistance . at that age i \u2019 d have been hard - pressed to successfully mail a postcard to myself without help , and no kid i knew who was mature to enough understand the value of money was about to part with any prized currency by sending it to a tv host who promised nothing in return , no matter how nicely he asked . nonetheless , decades later sloppy historians were still reporting that \u201c it worked . according to reports it was \u2018 the biggest heist since the brink \u2019 s robbery .'\u201d 1 <PARA> it didn \u2019 t work . although various accounts credit soupy with having received up to $ 80 , 000 through the mail , sales himself has revealed on numerous occasions that he netted only a few real dollars , along with a lot of play money , green monopoly money , and other forms of fake currency : <PARA> perhaps someone should have been more concerned with the gullibility of parents , not children .",

( those having momentary trouble grasping the importance of the term \u2019 s reversal should spend a moment contemplating the difference between \u2018 cathouse \u2019 and \u2018 housecat .\u2019) <PARA> the evolution of handicap to include its \u2018 physical disability \u2019 meaning took place over a number of centuries , and it is necessary to delve into the rules of \u2018 hand - in - cap \u2019 <PARA> ( a lottery game from the 1600s ) to gain an understanding of the <MASK> meaning of the word and how from those early beginnings it progressed to emcompass the myriad meanings we now assign to it . <PARA> to play hand - in - cap required three people ; two players and a referee . the game began with all three putting forfeit money into a cap , with ownership of this kitty to be decided by the outcome of the game . each of the two players would then offer up an item he thought the other guy might want . the referee would inspect the items and assign a monetary value to the difference between the worth of the two things , thereby more or less equalizing the transaction . he who offered the lesser - valued item also had to pony up with the amount decreed by the referee . <PARA> once this appraisal was completed , the two players would reach into their pockets to either draw out loose change or not , depending <MORE> the jump from a game \u2019 s name to \u2018 way to equalize a contest \u2019 from there become synonymous with \u2018 imposed impediment ,\u2019 and then just \u2018 impediment .\u2019 <PARA> once again , the use of the word expanded : handicap grew from being strictly a sporting term to cascade into the mainstream of the language . divorced of its gaming associations , it came to mean \u2018 a physical limitation ,\u2019 an extension of its \u2018 impediment \u2019 meaning . <PARA> a simple timeline of the word \u2019 s development : <PARA> at no point in the word \u2019 s <MASK> does \u2018 cap in hand \u2019 surface . as <MASK> above , it developed by a different route . it also means something entirely different . <PARA> \u2018 cap in hand \u2019 comes to us from the custom of uncovering the head as a sign of reverence , respect , or courtesy . its earliest sighting dates to 1565 where it referred to a show of subservience made to a judge . its shift from a sign of respect ( similar to addressing a gentleman as \u201c sir \u201d) to a term meaning \u2018 to importune another for a favor \u2019 is less simple to date accurately . its first clear use in this context occurs in 1887 , but earlier oxford english dictionary entries could be parsed as supporting this meaning . <PARA> nowadays \u2018 cap in hand \u2019 has dropped its <MASK> meaning of \u2018 a sign of reverence , respect , or courtesy \u2019 and has solely come to mean \u2018 to humbly seek a favor .\u2019 ( one is said to go \u2018 cap in hand \u2019 to one \u2019 s boss when asking for a raise , for instance .) <PARA> as to why some choose to believe in a provably <MASK> etymology of handicap that asserts it has ties to the disabled having to subsist as beggars in times past , one can only speculate it has to do with recent abhorrence for handicapped as a description of the disabled . some elements of current society choose to stress abilities over shortcomings , thus terms that identify the disabled as lacking something the abled possess have fallen out of favor with them . handicapped is seen as offensive by some because it stresses the negative , possibly leading to a continued view of the disabled as less than worthy members of the human race . likewise , disabled is also seen as offensive to some who prefer the more ability - positive term less abled . <PARA> what has this to do with a <MASK> etymology ? well , it \u2019 s far easier to convince folks to eschew a word if it can be tied to an offensive image than it is to get them to swear it off based on mere preference for something else . <PARA> barbara \u201c beggars description , doesn \u2019 t it ?\u201d mikkelson",

        "text": "whether modern depictions of the appearance of jesus are historically accurate has long been a subject of debate , and one <MASK> related to that debate holds that the modern image of jesus is largely based on the appearance of cesare borgia , a 15th century italian nobleman . <PARA> <MASK> about cesare borgia \u2019 s likeness forming the basis for all modern depictions of jesus are scattered . an online \u201c encyclopedia \u201d of dubious merit asserts the <MASK> as a \u201c little known fact ,\u201d crediting french novelist alexandre dumas for the notion that borgia \u201c influenced many images of jesus christ painted during and subsequent to his career .\u201d <PARA> dumas was , while celebrated , a writer of fiction and not an historian . the <MASK> is frequently attributed to \u201c volume i \u201d of dumas \u2019 celebrated crimes ( the borgias ), but we were unable to locate an expression of it in that essay . <PARA> myriad online image macros assert that borgia \u2019 s father \u201c forced \u201d his son \u2019 s visage into art <MASK> ( a <MASK> offered as an irony given that the borgia family were supposedly \u201c not christ - like \u201d), but no <MASK> ever accompanies such assertions : <PARA> such images imply that the relatively standardized , modern depiction of jesus emerged in approximately 1490 , but art historians might argue otherwise . although the renaissance produced a vast quantity of the most prominent depictions of jesus , plenty of artworks antedating 1490 bear the same visual qualities that were purportedly based on those of borgia : <PARA> contrary to <MASK> that jesus \u2019 now - common characteristics emerged in 1490 , artworks from the middle ages and early renaissance depicted jesus in very much the same way that later artworks did . giotto di bondone \u2019 s well - known 1305 mural the lamentation of christ features a white man with long brown hair , and sandro botticelli \u2019 s 1487 madonna of the pomegranate depicts a similarly featured infant christ . hieronymus bosch \u2019 s ecce homo also antedates 1490 but demonstrates a recognizably familiar jesus , as does duccio di buoninsegna \u2019 s early 1300 \u2019 s christ \u2019 s farewell to his apostles ( and other works ) and bondone \u2019 s contemporaneous last supper ( a very commonly depicted scene across time ). <PARA> the similarities in jesus \u2019 image extend to other regions and movements , with flemish renaissance depictions antedating 1490 but still fitting the common pattern . a long haired , pale - skinned jesus was observed in artworks from 1250 and centuries prior . clearly , 1490 was in no way the year , or even the millennium , in which the most common characteristics of jesus \u2019 depiction in art were solidified . moreover , limitations in the transmission of ideas and trends in that era was such that ; the establishment of a \u201c new jesus \u201d would have taken years to propagate across countries and cultures in europe . <PARA> many image macros assert that cesare borgia was the son of a corrupt gangster , a criminal , a dictator , and a sexual deviant . although borgia is historically established as one of the likely illegitimate children of pope alexander vi ( born rodrigo borgia ), reference works describe the elder borgia as a controversial pope but not a \u201c gangster .\u201d it \u2019 s widely held that pope alexander vi \u2019 s checkered reign led in part to the backlash heralding the protestant reformation , but historical literature doesn \u2019 t describe him as a \u201c dictator .\u201d as for cesare borgia himself , he was born in 1476 and died at the age of 31 in 1507 , so had his image been used as the model for jesus in artworks created in or before 1490 , those works would have been based on the features of a young teenager . <PARA> cesare borgia of course lived centuries before the advent of cameras , so the most common image we have of borgia now is a portrait of disputed provenance : <PARA> the scant record includes another portrait which bears no noteworthy resemblance to either contemporaneous 15th century or modern depictions of jesus : <PARA> in 2001 forensic anthropologist richard neave created a model of a galilean man for a bbc documentary , son of god , working on the basis of an actual skull found in the region . neave did not <MASK> his model showed jesus \u2019 s face but rather offered it as a means of prompting people to consider a jesus who looked like a man of his time and place , since the bible does not describe jesus as having distinctive features : <PARA> much like conspiracy theories based primarily on modern photographs , the <MASK> that depictions of jesus <MASK> with a portrait of borgia appear to hinge almost entirely on negligible visual similarities in multiple artworks and the efficacy of suggestion . <PARA> no specific painting is routinely cited as one for which cesare borgia purportedly sat as a model ( or which he inspired ), and oddly enough , the image most commonly associated with this <MASK> was painted in 1940 and bears no resemblance to the few extant borgia portraits . <PARA> the <MASK> about borgia and jesus is possibly a distant variant of old and long - circulating <MASK> that renaissance artist michaelangelo buonarroti \u2019 s famed sistine chapel ceiling contains \u201c easter eggs \u201d evidencing covert motives or illustrating grudges on the artist \u2019 s part .",

<PARA> that may well have sprung from the tales of a seaman who traversed the seas about a century before sailors began swearing to one another they \u2019 d run into these signs in the u . s . in before the wind , the memoirs set down by captain charles tyng in the years before his death in 1879 , is found this passage describing his first voyage in 1815 and a sign encountered at cowes on the isle of wight ( a small island lying just south of england ). <PARA> i went into the boat ashore at once , and walked up a little ways from the boat to a small woods , to see how things looked on land , and feeling that i was in a civilized country , i thought i should enjoy the sight after being at sea so long \u2014 when to my surprise and disgust i noticed a sign stuck up with \u201c dogs and sailors are forbidden to trespass here ,\u201d and that is about all the impression i have of cowes at that time . <PARA> captain tyng \u2019 s 25 - year career as a seaman brought him to the norfolk area on many occasions , so he had innumerable opportunities to repeat this yarn to various sailors he encountered there and in various seafarers \u2019 haunts across a span of many years . he also likely shared it with his shipmates , who in turn would present it to others of their acquaintance as an example of the hard lot of a seaman \u2019 s life . because its core message ( that sailing men are viewed as contaminations of orderly society and so meant to be made feel unwelcome and quickly sent on their ways ) strikes a universal chord among others similarly given the cold shoulder , the <MASK> would be quickly seized upon as a telling example of the sort of callous handling military personnel have themselves been subjected to . <PARA> barbara \u201c naval gazing \u201d mikkelson",

        "text": "some faux news stories ( often ones invented by tabloids such as the weekly world news ) are so bizarrely appealing to the world at large that they continue to live on no matter how many stakes are driven through their hearts . thus , despite having long since been \u201c debunked ,\u201d far out tales about ogling women \u2019 s breasts being \u201c good for a man \u2019 s health \u201d or an employee \u2019 s dying at his desk and going completely unnoticed by his co - workers for five days continue to circulate as \u201c real news \u201d year after year and are even occasionally reprinted as fact by the legitimate press . <PARA> so it is with the <MASK> of the hapless circus dwarf who supposedly died when he bounced off a trampoline straight into the maw of a hippopotamus , a tale that has been disseminated via the internet for nearly thirty years now , with occasional appearances in straight news media along the way : <PARA> as far as we \u2019 ve been able to ascertain , the \u201c hippo eats dwarf \u201d <MASK> made its internet debut in 1994 , when it was posted to a usenet newsgroup as part of a collection of odd news accounts taken from national lampoon magazine \u2019 s \u201c <MASK> facts \u201d feature ( where it was attributed to the las vegas sun newspaper ). although many of the other items appearing in that \u201c <MASK> facts \u201d collection along with the \u201c hippo eats dwarf \u201d tale might seem to be nothing more than inventive fiction , they appear to be \u201c real \u201d in the sense that ( <MASK> or not ) they were taken from standard news sources . ( for example , the account of fraternity members at the university of washington being caught in possession of stolen sheep while \u201c dressed in their underwear , with white grease on their hands and peanut butter and other substances on their bodies \u201d was in fact reported in the chronicle of higher education .) <PARA> where the hippo - dwarf incident ostensibly took place isn \u2019 t even clear , as the three - sentence summary <MASK> above is ambiguous : was the deceased an austrian dwarf working for a circus of indeterminate locale , or was he a dwarf of unidentified nationality employed by an austrian circus ? either way , since many circuses typically engage in tours , we can \u2019 t assume his fatal plunge took place in austria . nonetheless , despite conducting extensive searches of databases that index newspapers from the u . s . and around the world , we have been unable to find any <MASK> that this news <MASK> ran in the las vegas sun ( or any other newspaper ) prior to its initial appearance on the internet or in national lampoon . <PARA> the closest items we could find were 1990 news stories from the uk about a three - ton hippo named hilda ( apparently a popular appellation for the large creatures , perhaps due in part to the influence of popular children \u2019 s books written and illustrated by richard scarry ) who briefly escaped onto the grass verge of the a303 near thruxton , hampshire , after the trailer carrying her from longleat safari park in wiltshire to windsor safari park overturned . ( unfortunately , hilda did not survive the process of being tranquilized and re - loaded into the truck .) <PARA> the \u201c hippo eats dwarf \u201d tale experienced a renaissance when it was published by thailand \u2019 s pattaya mail newspaper in 1999 . that version set the incident in northern thailand , changed the ill - fated dwarf \u2019 s name to \u201c od ,\u201d and added some rather dubious details ( such as noting that hilda was \u201c a vegetarian who had not previously digested a circus performer \u201d and that the police sent the circus trampoline out \u201c for forensic analysis \u201d): <PARA> the pattaya mail \u2018 s account was quickly picked up and re - published by several australian newspapers , including the daily telegraph , the advertiser , and the sunday mail , leading to another round of \u201c look at this genuine news <MASK> !\u201d sightings . the <MASK> has continued to grow since then , picking up even more loopy embellishments about vegetarianism , alcoholism , and laxatives along the way : <PARA> scanned copies of various newspaper re - printings of the pattaya mail <MASK> have been circulated on the internet , lending credence to the notion that \u201c hippo eats dwarf \u201d was a creditable news <MASK> : <PARA> the express \u2018 \u201c beachcomber \u201d columnist penned a tongue - in - cheek column about the phenomenon of the mutating \u201c hippo eats dwarf \u201d tale a few years ago , in which he noted : <PARA> based on the lack of any reputable source to document the expiration of a trampoline - bouncing austrian circus dwarf at the hands ( er , mouth ) of a hippopotamus amphibius , we have to opt for the former alternative ( i . e ., practical joke masquerading as fact ). its truthfulness notwithstanding , the famous headline has since been memorialized as the name of an auckland band .",

        "text": "in 2009 , biologist judy mikovits , who was then the research director of the chronic fatigue syndrome - focused whittemore peterson institute ( wpi ), published a paper on what she and many others thought to be a major scientific breakthrough in the prestigious journal science . her team alleged to have demonstrated an association between a newly discovered retrovirus called \u201c xenotropic murine leukemia virus - related virus \u201d ( xmrv ) and the poorly understood condition known as chronic fatigue syndrome ( cfs ), suggesting a potential viral cause for cfs . <PARA> the paper received substantial international coverage . however , as with so many other potentially groundbreaking studies , nobody \u2014 including many of the same researchers involved with the <MASK> study \u2014 was able to replicate its results . numerous attempts failed to replicate the study , and the research itself came under increasing scrutiny for sloppy methods and its reliance on misleading or manufactured figures . <PARA> on 1 july 2011 , science \u2019 s editors issued a \u201c <MASK> of concern \u201d about the paper . on 14 october 2011 , the authors issued a partial retraction of their paper that touched on issues with some of their figures . finally , on 23 december 2011 , the editors of science retracted the paper in full : <PARA> three months later , the whittemore peterson institute fired judy mikovits amid concerns over the integrity of her work and her collaboration with an outside scientist , as reported in the multidisciplinary scientific journal nature : <PARA> a few months after that , mikovits was arrested in southern california \u201c on an \u2018 out of county warrant \u2019 from washoe county , nevada , for allegedly taking lab notebooks , a computer , and other material from the whittemore peterson institute in reno , nevada , after the wpi fired her .\u201d the arrest came in conjunction with a lawsuit from wpi that sought a restraining order to block mikovits \u2019 destruction of data which they maintained belonged to the institute : <PARA> the charges were dropped , not because of the merits of the case , but due to a variety of complicating legal factors related to the family that runs the whittemore peterson institute : <PARA> fast forwarding to 2018 , we find that mikovits has become lionized by the medical conspiracy community , appearing on unreliable websites such as natural news and giving talks at fringe conferences such as the truth about cancer and autism one , with her <MASK> echoing through the various clickbait factories that regurgitate wholesale content from these dubious organizations . for example , the website \u201c real farmacy \u201d described mikovits \u2019 saga as follows in a 28 november 2018 post : <PARA> astute readers may note that the 2009 paper discussed above did not concern vaccines . mikovits , following the publication of her since - retracted paper , made a series of unsupported <MASK> <MORE> supposedly been infected with viruses \u201c that came from out of labs into humans via contaminated blood and vaccines \u201d: <PARA> as noted above , mikovits \u2019 controversial paper did not demonstrate that xmrv \u201c came out of the lab into humans via contaminated blood and vaccines \u201d; rather , it speculated such after seemingly demonstrating a ( now discredited ) association between xmrv and cfs . to say mikovits was jailed for exposing widespread virus transmission via vaccines or blood transfusions is <MASK> , not only because she was actually jailed for allegedly stealing property , but also because she never scientifically demonstrated the <MASK> she suggests the government wanted to silence her over . in her interview with natural news , mikovits <MASK> that the idea for the connection between viruses and vaccines came from another researcher in a paper published in 2011 : <PARA> that paper , which referenced two other now - retracted papers in its abstract , only presented the vaccine scenario speculatively as a potential route for humans to acquire xmrv : <PARA> that study did conclude by opining that the \u201c most likely mode of xmrv transmission points to mouse - derived biological products \u201d and <MASK> that the authors hoped the study would \u201c spur further discussion and help to resolve the many remaining xmrv questions .\u201d but in a paper published just five months later titled \u201c xmrv : not a mousy virus \u201d, those same authors walked back <MASK> of xmrv \u2019 s prevalence ( and even its existence as a <MASK> human virus ) based on results which called earlier laboratory methods into question : <PARA> further research determined that all xmrv samples detected in these studies stemmed from a contaminated cell line affecting all the labs performing these studies , that it did not cause disease , and that it did not enter the population via vaccines or blood transfusions : <PARA> therefore , mikovits \u2019 speculative <MASK> linking her research to vaccine science , drawing the ire of \u201c big pharma \u201d and the \u201c deep <MASK> \u201d, and her subsequent arrest are not rooted in science or reality . but although she may have lost the support of the scientific community , she appears to have found a new home in the pseudoscientific conspiracy world . <PARA> \u201c in the united <MASK> of america ... everything \u2019 s censored ,\u201d mikovits said on the website of a man who guest hosts alex jones \u2019 infowars conspiracy ranting , \u201c so to look at things like natural news , to come to meetings like the truth about cancer , i was just floored today because today was the first time i was treated like a human being who had knowledge for a very long time .\u201d <PARA> in 2020 , mikovits was featured in a film called \u201c plandemic \u201d that supposedly exposed \u201c the hidden agenda behind the covid - 19 \u201d coronavirus disease pandemic .",

string performance from a master violinist worthy of being designated \u201c the most gripping performance of the evening \u201d over a bartok sonata , no matter how finely played the latter may have been . <PARA> itzhak perlman played at avery fisher hall a few other times in 1995 , but none of the reviews of those performances included any mention of his finishing on three strings either <MORE> . when he finished , there was an awesome silence that filled the room . then people rose and cheered . perlman smiled , wiped his brow , and raised the bow of his violin to quiet them . he spoke , not boastfully , but quietly in a pensive tone , \u2018 you know , sometimes it is the artist \u2019 s task to find out how much music you can still make with what you have left .'\u201d <PARA> perlman was scheduled to play a difficult , challenging violin concerto . in the middle of the performance one of the strings on his violin snapped with a rifle - like popping noise that filled the entire auditorium . the orchestra immediately stopped playing and the audience held its collective breath . the assumption was he would have to put on his braces , pick up his crutches , and leave the stage . either that or someone would have to come out with another string or replace the violin . after a brief pause , perlman set his violin under his chin and signaled to the conductor to begin . <PARA> one person in the audience reported what happened : \u201c i know it is impossible to play a violin concerto with only three strings . i know that and so do you , but that night , isaac perlman refused to know it . you could see him modulating , changing , and recomposing in his head . at one point it sounded as if he were re - tuning the strings to get a new sound that had never been heard before . when he finished , there was an awesome silence that filled the room . then people rose and cheered . perlman smiled , wiped his brow , and raised the bow of his violin to quiet them . he spoke , not boastfully , but quietly in a pensive tone , \u2018 you know , sometimes it is the artist \u2019 s task to find out how much music you can still make with what you have left .'\u201d <PARA> this version is slightly more credible in that it has perlman continuing on three strings after one broke \u201c in the middle of the performance \u201d rather than \u201c just as he finished the first few bars ,\u201d but such an occurrence would still be extraordinary enough to draw the attention of the media , and we haven \u2019 t found any indication that it did . so , we \u2019 re left with a <MASK> of anecdotal <MASK> which includes a moral typical of so many fabricated , glurgy tales : just as the damaged violin , crippled by the lack of a string , can still produce beautiful music , so can the \u201c damaged \u201d itzhak perlman , crippled by polio , still play the violin with \u201c such power and purity as the world has never heard before .\u201d",

        "text": "<MASK> : although influenza is no longer the unchecked grim reaper of years past ( in 1918 it killed half a million americans and twenty million folks worldwide ), it continues to present a very real danger even in these more modern times . according to the centers for disease control ( cdc ), millions of people in the united <MASK> \u2014 about 10 % to 20 % of u . s . residents \u2014 will get the flu each year . influenza also costs americans $ 10 billion annually in lost wages and medical expenses . worst of all , every year about 36 , 000 people in the united <MASK> die from it , and 114 , 000 have to be admitted to the hospital because of it . the flu is not just a week of feeling lousy and missing work ; it is a disease that can , has , and does kill . <PARA> some people are more vulnerable to the ravages of the flu than others , which is why those who are most at risk need to be shielded from its contagion . folks 65 years old and up , very young children , and those of any age who have chronic medical conditions need to be vaccinated annually against the flu . however , even those who aren \u2019 t especially young , old , or <PARA> infirm should get that annual vaccination because avoiding the flu also means sidestepping many dangerous complications such as bacterial pneumonias , ear and sinus infections , and even heart disease and strokes . yet it remains a sad fact that only a handful of people think to do this . worse , their personal aversion is carried over to those they are responsible for : a parent who does not herself get an annual flu shot is far less likely to seek one for her child , even for one in the highest risk group . flu vaccines have been available for many years , yet only 9 % to 25 % of children and young people with asthma get flu shots , and young asthmatics are one of the groups most at risk . <PARA> cost , inconvenience , and dread of injection keep people from availing themselves of this preventive . the stumbling blocks of cost and inconvenience are being eroded , however : the price of a flu shot is down to $ 17 , and inject \u2018 n \u2019 go <MASK> spring up in pharmacies and other locations every october and november , so it \u2019 s no longer a question of having to make an appointment with the family doctor and take time off from work to keep it . but a needle is still a needle . <PARA> aversion to needles explains the appeal of vaccines that are sprayed into the nose : do away with the needle , and more people will choose to guard themselves from the <MORE> drive to have everyone vaccinated against influenza as \u201c motivated purely by economics \u201d when such an initiative could easily prevent most of those deaths strikes many as flat - out wrong . <PARA> it is <MASK> flumist \u2019 s manufacturer , medimmune vaccines , and its marketer , wyeth vaccines , have been advertising the intranasal vaccine heavily , especially in television ads . they \u2019 ve a product to sell , and they \u2019 re intent upon selling it . but it can also be reasonably concluded that the availability of a non - injected flu vaccine will motivate many who would otherwise have gone unprotected to guard themselves against a disease that kills . people do fear needles , and their trepidation influences them to delay or entirely eschew vaccination . take away the needle , and more will seek out the vaccine . <PARA> some sources suggest flumist will result in a protection against the flu virus that will last far longer than the protection imparted by injected vaccines , but this <MASK> has yet to be fully substantiated . however , if this does prove to be the case , it would become a strong argument in the favor of the nasally - delivered protectant , because a traditional flu vaccination given in october can lose its effectiveness by march , leaving its host vulnerable to infection . the buzz about flumist suggests its protection will last a full year . ( repeated vaccinations are necessary to protect against new strains of the flu , and because the body \u2019 s immunity to the flu declines over time .) <PARA> there is a risk that a small number of those who avail themselves of the intranasal vaccine will pass the live virus used in it to others , but is there not a far greater danger presented by those whose fear of needles keeps them from getting vaccinated ? they catch the flu , and they pass it to others , with the contagion so transmitted living on through their victims to infect even more . vaccine , no matter how delivered , can stop the spread of virus . <PARA> barbara \u201c marriage does not have to mean \u2018 what \u2019 s mine is yours '\u201d mikkelson <PARA> update : as of mid - november 2003 , medimmune had sold only 400 , 000 doses of flumist and estimated that 50 to 80 per cent of those doses might be returned unused . the primary factors behind the low sales figures were retail giant wal - mart \u2019 s canceling plans to offer the vaccine in 1 , 000 of its stores , the fact that members of the target group for whom the fda approved flumist ( healthy people from ages 5 to 49 ) rarely get flu shots , and consumer reluctance to spend several times more than the cost of a conventional flu shot in order to avoid a needle .",

        "text": "immigration is a sensitive and touchy issue , and never more so than in the united <MASK> during an election year . thus , when stories started to emerge in 2016 about a group of veterans of the u . s . military living in mexico after they had been deported from the united <MASK> ( a <MASK> we previously reported on ) it seemed natural to question what looked like nothing more than a chunk of political kryptonite . <PARA> however , deported veterans exist , although no one \u2014 not even the department of homeland security \u2014 knows how many . their issue has been slowly brought into mainstream american consciousness largely by the efforts of committed activists in tijuana . <PARA> \u201c the bunker ,\u201d also known as the deported veterans support house , is in a small cinderbrick building tucked away on a side street in mexico \u2019 s border town of tijuana , and is frequented by veterans of every branch of the united <MASK> military , who fought everywhere from vietnam to afghanistan . former army paratrooper hector barajas , 39 , opened it to be a gathering place and a refuge for veterans who , like him , had been deported : <PARA> \u201c i started the bunker because there was a need ,\u201d barajas told us . <PARA> he said since his deportation , he had been meeting others like him living in tijuana , and discovered that they lived throughout mexico \u2014 but not just mexico . there are hundreds of deported military vets living in at least twenty countries , he said . since then , the bunker has since become less a refuge and more a cause : <PARA> it may come as a surprise to learn that serving in the united <MASK> military does not automatically confer citizenship , but it doesn \u2019 t . it can smooth the way , provided the aspiring citizen is aware of what they need to do in order to apply for citizenship and gets it done within a certain timeframe . however , it \u2019 s not uncommon for enlistees to wrongly assume ( having never been told otherwise ) they have done all they need to do in order to be awarded citizenship , and thus all they have to do after their honorable discharge is wait . <PARA> sometimes , too , there are bureaucratic foulups . one man was deported after he was unable to attend a hearing , despite his reason : he was in the hospital receiving surgery at the time . others do everything the way they \u2019 re supposed to , filing their paperwork and appearing at their meetings , but still get deported , and no one seems to know exactly why . once they are outside the u . s ., they maintain a legal right to va benefits such as healthcare , and to whatever funds they might be entitled , but they have no way of getting back into the united <MASK> to obtain that assistance , and there are no satellite offices outside the country to help them . <PARA> because these particular veterans are either in the united <MASK> on green cards or without documentation after their discharges , they can be deported with cause , or for no reason at all . past and present members of the armed forces are supposed to receive special consideration during deportation hearings , but the guidelines are inconsistently applied . <PARA> however , some of these veterans have spent time in prison for assault or drug offenses , which makes their situation more difficult to parse , at least politically . elected officials ( and candidates ) who might ordinarily be in full - throated cry about the importance of military rights tend to go oddly silent when confronted with the spectres of undocumented soldiers . sympathy for those wounded on the battlefield under the american flag suddenly falters when it turns out they had entered the country without documentation years before . <PARA> miguel perez , a united <MASK> army veteran , falls under that category . the 39 - year - old illinois man , who served two tours in afghanistan and who has been in the u . s . since he was eight , was convicted of a drug trafficking offense in 2008 . the green card holder had served half of a 15 - year prison sentence when immigration , customs , and enforcement took him for deportation proceedings . after losing an appeal , perez was deported in march 2018 : <PARA> unless something changes for them , the only way most of the deported veterans will be able to return to the united <MASK> is by dying . by law , all military veterans ( except those who have been dishonorably discharged ) are entitled to burial in a national cemetery , and immigration laws don \u2019 t apply to corpses . <PARA> on 20 april 2016 , lawmakers introduced a bill to readmit military veterans who were deported and who were not previously convicted of serious crimes . it would also prevent the removal of military veterans from the u . s . in the future . <PARA> on 13 april 2018 , hector barajas , the deported veteran who was one of the first to shine a spotlight on their plight , received his american citizenship , potentially paving the way for hundreds of other former united <MASK> military members :",

        "text": "in february 2016 , a meme about the lack of business acumen and experience exhibited by vermont senator bernie sanders , a democratic presidential candidate , began circulating online : <PARA> the criticisms offered in meme were a mixture of <MASK> , <MASK> , irrelevant , and misleading <MASK> . to wit : <PARA> never owned a business <PARA> right off , this meme begins with a rather nebulous criticism . although having owned a business is an experience many voters would like to see on the r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of a potential chief executive , a literal application of that term isn \u2019 t of much relevance . technically , a person who once operated a roadside lemonade stand has \u201c owned a business ,\u201d while a person who has spent his career serving as the ceo of a public multi - national , multi - billion dollar corporation has not \u2014 even though everyone would agree the latter has vastly more business experience than the former . and certainly a number of highly - regarded u . s . presidents in the modern era ( e . g ., franklin roosevelt , dwight eisenhower , john kennedy , ronald reagan ) never owned their own businesses . <PARA> moreover , one might validly say that sanders started and operated his own business ( whether he \u201c owned \u201d it is somewhat arguable , as it was a non - profit ), the american people \u2019 s historical society , which was created in 1978 to produce educational film strips about the <MASK> of vermont . the university of vermont has archived several of the brochures produced by the american people \u2019 s historical society , one of which includes a <MASK> from sanders outlining the purpose of his film strips : <PARA> while the financials of the american people \u2019 s historical society are not available , sanders wrote in his memoir outsider in the house that the business was reasonably successful and \u201c a lot of fun .\u201d a friend of sanders \u2019 told politico that the film strip business \u201c wasn \u2019 t just a way to make money ... he made filmstrips about people he admired and believed in . he just thought kids should know the truth of how things really were .\u201d <PARA> never invented anything <PARA> once again , this is a rather nebulous criticism . the concept of \u201c inventing \u201d something could range from simply thinking up a novel idea ( but doing nothing more about it ), to creating and building a device for personal use ( but not marketing it ), to actually obtaining a patent for a new product . bernie sanders is certainly no inventor and holds no patents , but it \u2019 s hard to see how that fact is of any relevance , as the same is <MASK> of nearly every u . s . president . <PARA> thomas jefferson might legitimately be considered an inventor <MORE> holds six senate committee appointments ), meet with constituents , participate in oversight and investigation of governmental affairs , etc ., as detailed in \u201c the many roles of a member of congress \u201d: <PARA> lived off welfare before elected to public office <PARA> as noted above , various acquaintances who knew sanders in the years before he achieved public office have reported that he was \u201c always poor ,\u201d and he likely received public assistance at some point during that time , although what form of ( and how much ) assistance he received is difficult to determine at this remove . a contemporaneous newspaper account from the bennington banner reported that in 1974 , when sanders ran for the u . s . senate on the liberty union party ticket , he was collecting unemployment benefits : <PARA> 74 year old \u2014 personal net worth of $ 300 , 000 <PARA> as 247 wall st . reported , determining the precise net worth of candidates is difficult for a number of reasons : <PARA> 247 wall st . attempted to determine each presidential candidate \u2019 s net worth in an <MASK> published on 24 august 2015 . they estimated that sanders was one of the \u201c poorest presidential candidates \u201d running for office in 2016 , with a likely net worth somewhere around $ 330 , 000 : <PARA> as of late 2019 , open secrets , the website of the center for responsive politics , estimated sanders \u2019 net worth at between $ 729 , 000 and $ 1 . 8 million , making him neither the richest nor the poorest presidential hopeful in the 2020 field . <PARA> in any case , the meme \u2019 s characterization of sanders as a \u201c loser \u201d based on his net worth evinces a rather skewed perspective . although many people view financial rewards as a tangible measure of one \u2019 s success , it is far from the only factor by which accomplishment can be measured . ( in fact , highly - regarded president harry s . truman had virtually no net worth even after leaving the white house in 1953 and afterwards was largely dependent upon congress \u2019 finally establishing a pension for former presidents .) <PARA> bernie sanders might equally be considered a \u201c winner \u201d for persevering at his goal of achieving a political career long after others might have given up , and for succeeding at that effort despite prolonged financial hardship . unlike many others , sanders might also be lauded for maintaining a rather plain life and not having enriched himself in public service ( especially since candidates at the other end of the financial spectrum are frequently criticized for being \u201c out of touch with the common man \u201d). <PARA> as 247 wall st . wrote of sanders : <PARA> all in all , that sounds like quite an impressive career achievement for anyone \u2014 regardless of net worth .",

( his representatives also told us that although they were familiar with the legend , they could not verify that the event it describes had actually taken place .) <PARA> it \u2019 s interesting to note that a similar \u201c returned item \u201d tale has been told of scottish poet james montgomery : <PARA> although the returned car legend highlights the positive associations many felt and still feel about this man , other <MASK> about mr . rogers are far less acclamatory , such as <MASK> that he was a sniper with many kills to his credit , or that he was a convicted child molester , or that he wore sweaters to conceal large tattoos on his arms . each of those tales is <MASK> .",

[ 29 october ] and they are all doing surprisingly well . a dear friend made a web site to help us deal with the \u201c rumour mill \u201d and to post the photos of each of them \u2014 as we are looking for good homes for them \u2014 there is an adoption fee as recommended by our vet and the draft horse people due to the issue of the horse meat for consumption with drafts going to japan ( what a learning experience , sad , sad , sad , what goes on out there ...) <PARA> please pass it on so folks know the real <MASK> from the horse \u2019 s mouth so to say , i appreciate that . <PARA> please pass it on so folks know the real <MASK> from the horse \u2019 s mouth so to say , i appreciate that . <PARA> the referenced web site , horse rescue niagara , provides information about and pictures of the horses currently in need of adoption : <PARA> there are 8 mares , and one gelding . the herd consists of belgiums , percherons , and percheron cross and 3 red roans ( forgive me if this is not 100 % correct , we are donkey people !). all under 10 years old . they were running \u201c free \u201d for years in a huge pasture , no shots , no worming , etc .

( in retrospect i should have taken the time to see exactly what was posted but at that moment , time was an issue , literally a few days . i was frantically making calls to see what we could do ,( <MORE> have been strongly recommended to charge an adoption fee ( between $ 600 . 00 and $ 700 . 00 ) which we are doing . if someone or someone you know has the proper facilities and kind intentions and would take more than one ( we would like to keep as many together as possible ) than we are certainly flexible . if we cannot find suitable homes for adoption than we would give them to a proper sanctuary that we trust to provide them a good , and respectful life , we have already chosen one and spoken with them . <PARA> for whoever takes the time to read this , and is from the niagara region , my husband and i would like to express our thanks to the folks that were taking \u201c care of the matter \u201d for the old man , they apparently were called by a lot of people who all had a lot of assumptions .

( however , the relative high dollar value of the coupon and lack of restrictions on its use essentially promised value identical to that of a gift card scam .) <PARA> facebook fans of target posted to the retailer \u2019 s wall to inquire about the coupon or thank the chain for offering such a generous deal . target \u2018 s official facebook account published responses to many of the replies warning consumers that the offer was not legitimate , that the coupon did not <MASK> from target , and that its <MASK> were likely seeking users \u2019 personal information : <PARA> that isn \u2019 t a valid target promotion and is most likely an attempt to gather your personal information . please don \u2019 t click any links or provide any info . thanks so much for taking the time to let us know ! have a great day ! \u2014 philip <PARA> moreover , cursory closer examination of the purported $ 100 target coupon revealed that portions of the image ( particularly where the dollar amount appeared ) had been doctored .",

        "text": "social media users are never slow to tip each other off to new or ongoing scams and frauds , as we have examined many times over the years , and they \u2019 re likewise keen to share novel ways to counteract those scams and frauds . <PARA> in february 2019 , a viral facebook post offered readers advice on how to detect gas <MASK> credit card skimmers , devices that capture details from a card \u2019 s magnetic stripe , allowing thieves to engage in fraudulent spending : <PARA> this warning was a somewhat crude explanation of a real phenomenon : the bluetooth sensor on a mobile phone can indeed be used to detect some \u2014 though by no means all \u2014 credit card skimmers at gas pumps and atms . <PARA> the warning is related to a particular kind of credit card skimmer that is placed in a credit card reader at an atm or gas <MASK> pump . ( the facebook post confusingly referred to a \u201c card reader \u201d rather than a \u201c card skimmer .\u201d) <PARA> when a customer inserts a card into the reader , the transaction takes place as normal and the customer \u2019 s card is debited , but the skimmer also extracts all the relevant data from the magnetic stripe on the card , including the credit card number , expiry date , and security code . <PARA> the thieves who planted the skimmer can then return to the machine and use a bluetooth transmitter to transfer all the stored credit card details from the skimmer to a storage device such as a mobile phone or laptop , all without having to physically remove the skimmer . <PARA> bluetooth technology <PARA> not all credit card skimmers operate using bluetooth technology in this way , but many do , and this use of bluetooth technology is what leaves the skimmers vulnerable to detection . we asked nick poole , an electronics expert at the hobby electronics company sparkfun and co - creator of the \u201c skimmer scanner \u201d android app , to outline how they work . <PARA> poole explained that he and his colleagues were consulted by local law enforcement in colorado after a wave of credit card skimmer thefts at gas <MASK> in 2017 and were able to reverse engineer some of the skimmers removed from the pumps , adding that : <PARA> when poole and his colleagues worked with police in colorado in 2017 , they found that the majority of credit card skimmers that employed bluetooth technology used bluetooth modules called hc - 05 or hc - 06 . poole told us he was informed at that time that the hc - 05 and hc - 06 modules had been widely encountered by law enforcement in skimmers across the united <MASK> , though they were by no means the only kind of bluetooth module used in credit card skimmers . <PARA> so even without using poole \u2019 mobile app <MORE> scanners could be a useful way to counteract the threat posed by credit card skimmers but also acknowledged their limitations , writing in an email that they \u201c can help but they aren \u2019 t <MASK> \u201d: <PARA> \u201c criminals are always trying to make the skimmers harder to spot . there are several other low - cost bluetooth modules in the same category as the hc - 05 , so this app [ skimmer scanner ] won \u2019 t detect all types of skimmers .\u201d <PARA> nunnikhoven recommended two additional precautions that customers could take if they were concerned about credit card skimmers at gas <MASK> pumps : <PARA> \u201c first , a physical check . does the keypad or credit card slot look well maintained and well fitted to the pump ? does it match the next pump ? secondly , monitor your credit card <MASK> for suspicious charges . as long as you aren \u2019 t negligent with your credit card and pin ( if you have one ), the protections provided by the credit card company ensure that if you do get skimmed , it \u2019 s only an annoyance ( changing all your billing info ) and not a financial catastrophe .\u201d <PARA> brian krebs , a leading cybersecurity reporter , told us that bluetooth detection such as that employed in the skimmer scanner app was useful in revealing one kind of credit card skimmer , but he recommended that consumers check the physical appearance of the gas pump reader instead : <PARA> \u201c overall , consumers are better off looking for <MASK> that use more modern pumps that include new security features ( no master key to rule them all , putting sensitive components in locked , steel cages inside the locked pump , point - to - point encryption , etc .). consumers can tell them apart simply by looking for pumps that have horizontal card readers and a raised keypad .\u201d <PARA> on the whole , the viral february 2019 facebook post was a fairly crude explanation of what is nonetheless a real phenomenon . a mobile phone \u2019 s bluetooth sensor can indeed be used to scan for and detect certain bluetooth modules known to be used in credit card skimmers . <PARA> what the facebook post did not make clear is that not every \u201c sequence of letters \u201d or \u201c sequence of numbers \u201d on a mobile phone \u2019 s bluetooth device list means a customer is in the presence of a credit card skimmer , nor will a mobile phone \u2019 s bluetooth sensor successfully identify every credit card skimmer in use in gas pumps and atms across the united <MASK> . <PARA> the mobile phone bluetooth scanner is a potentially useful way to lower the risk of exposure to some popular kinds of credit card skimmers , but it is not fool - <MASK> , and it is prone to both <MASK> negatives and <MASK> positives .",

        "text": "jeff bezos , founder and chief executive officer of online retailing giant amazon . com , became the world \u2019 s richest person in october 2017 , according to forbes magazine . and in january 2018 , bezos \u2019 company opened the first \u201c amazon go \u201d \u2014 a new kind of store with no checkout required \u2014 in seattle , washington , to considerable fanfare : <PARA> amid a wave of increased press coverage and scrutiny , a viral meme made a number number of <MASK> about amazon in january 2018 : <PARA> a spokesperson for amazon confirmed the fact that the company \u2019 s new grocery store , amazon go , does not accept snap benefits or food stamps as a form of payment . <PARA> the source of the <MASK> about amazon workers receiving food stamps was a january 2018 report by the nonprofit group policymatters ohio , which estimated that roughly 700 amazon workers in ohio ( more than 10 percent of the company \u2019 s employees in the <MASK> ) receive supplementary nutrition assistance program benefits : <PARA> policymatters ohio arrived at that estimate by finding the number of ohio food stamp recipients who are part of a household where someone works for amazon ( 1 , 430 ), then dividing that by 2 . 02 ( the average size of a household on food stamps in ohio at that time ). the resulting estimate is about 700 workers , or 11 . 8 of amazon \u2019 s ohio workforce . we were unable to find any research or data on amazon workers \u2019 availing themselves of food stamps in other <MASK> . <PARA> policymatters ohio sent us figures to corroborate their <MASK> , which they received from the ohio department of job and family services . ( that data is available for download in spreadsheet form here .) further , whether or not an individual qualifies for food stamps is determined by more than just income . having a gross monthly household income at or below 130 percent of the federal poverty limit is an important factor . however , you can also qualify for snap benefits with an income above the poverty limit if someone in your household is disabled or elderly , and the poverty limit is pro - rated depending on the size of your household . <PARA> another factor to consider is whether a worker is employed by amazon on a full - time or part - time basis . someone whose only source of income was their part - time job at an amazon fulfillment center would earn a lower monthly income than a full - time worker in a similar position , even if they received the same hourly wage . <PARA> this circumstance might well qualify someone for food stamps even if their hourly wage at amazon were otherwise not too bad . in an email , an amazon spokesperson told us that \u201c amazon full - <MORE> according to a major 2016 report by the non - profit institute for local self - reliance , a group that advocates for more sustainable community development , amazon \u2019 s warehouse workers across 11 metropolitan areas in the united <MASK> earned , on average , 15 percent lower than could be expected for a worker in that industry ( page 39 ). <PARA> amazon told us this analysis was \u201c flawed ,\u201d because it compared amazon wages with \u201c traditional warehouse jobs and compensation ,\u201d <MASK> that the appropriate comparison would be between amazon wages and retail wages , because \u201c that industry more closely resembles the environment of an amazon fulfillment center .\u201d <PARA> additionally , the report \u2019 s authors said it was difficult to ascertain exactly what proportion of warehouse workers were on permanent contracts , and what proportion were temps , but estimated ( based on news reports and the industry average ) that the permanent to temporary ratio was roughly 60 / 40 . <PARA> a spokesperson for the company gave contradictory figures , saying : \u201c throughout the year on average , 90 percent of associates across the company \u2019 s u . s . fulfillment network are regular , full - time employees . that applies for <MASK> like ohio .\u201d the spokesperson confirmed that \u201c regular \u201d means permanent . the ilsr criticized amazon for using the label \u201c seasonal \u201d \u2014 which has connotations of the annual retail holiday rush \u2014 to describe the temporary positions it fills year - round . <PARA> amazon has also previously come under fire for what have been described as difficult working conditions . in its 2016 report , the ilsr summarized employment at the company \u2019 s fulfillment centers as \u201c grueling work for lower pay than average \u201d: <PARA> in response to these descriptions , a spokesperson for the company told us : <PARA> while the meme says that amazon grossed $ 128 billion in sales \u201c last year ,\u201d that number is not quite accurate . for one thing , amazon \u2019 s 2017 earnings had not yet been published in january 2018 , when the meme was created . instead , grit post , where the meme appears to have <MASK> , said in a list of sources that they had used amazon \u2019 s 2016 numbers . amazon actually had net ( not gross ) sales of $ 136 billion in 2016 , according to the company \u2019 s full year financial results . this means gross sales ( which were not reported ) were even higher than that , and certainly higher than the $ 128 billion <MASK> in the meme . <PARA> amazon \u2019 s sales for 2017 are likely to be astronomical . based on the company \u2019 s predictions for the final three months of the year , amazon \u2019 s full - year net sales in 2017 might reach around $ 178 billion .",

        "text": "everyone in the cleaning industry has always been told that hand dryers in restrooms are not sanitary ; they spread germs and bacteria around . i always thought that this just came from the paper companies because they are loosing sales to the hand dryers . <PARA> a couple of years ago , i was working with a rep , and i noticed that after he washed his hands and noticed that there were no paper towels , only a hand dryer , he left the restroom with wet hands . i asked him about it . he said that hand dryers blow a lot of germs and bacteria around . he also told me to take a look under the hand dryer next time i was in a restroom . <PARA> there is a filter underneath the hand dryer that is supposed to be cleaned on a weekly basis . i looked at one and it looked like it hadn \u2019 t been cleaned in years . it had layers and layers of caked on gunk ( disgusting ). since then i will not use hand dryers in restrooms . <PARA> now this is where the <MASK> gets really interesting . the schools and universities that have had the h1n1 ( swine flue ) outbreak this year are being told by the health department that they have to take out all of their hand dryers and replace them with towel dispensers because the hand dryers are spreading disease . please pass this along so everyone knows not to use hand dryers . <PARA> <MASK> : this e - mailed alert began circulating in october 2009 . while its central <MASK> that forced air hand dryers spread disease is in dispute , we could find no substantiation for its ancillary assertion that schools and universities where there have been outbreaks of swine flu have been ordered by their local health departments to replace these machines with paper towel dispensers . try as we might , we haven \u2019 t been able to find any confirmatory information about such institutes of learning being told by anyone ( health department or otherwise ) to remove their forced - air hand dryers . <PARA> indeed , the centers for disease control ( cdc ) recommends in various online publications that public sinks be stocked with paper towels or equipped with hand dryers ( e . g ., its preventing the spread of influenza ( the flu ) in child care settings : guidance for administrators , care providers , and other staff <MASK> : \u201c ensure that sink locations and restrooms are stocked with soap , paper towels or working hand dryers \u201c). <PARA> regarding the e - mail \u2019 s central <MASK> about hand dryers contributing to the spread of disease , there \u2019 s no clear answer to the subject because what little research that has been done <PARA> in this area is disputed . a 2008 - 09 research paper <MORE> hands , since they \u2019 re not wet to begin with ), but rather of poorly - washed hands . precious few nasty microbes are dislodged by tap water alone : merely rinsing one \u2019 s hands under running water and then drying them with a blower is doing little other than putting microbe - laden ( albeit wet ) hands in front of a wind generating machine . <PARA> also , of those that use soap in the ablutions , not all that many wash their hands long enough to rid themselves of whatever nasties their hands have accumulated . for handwashing to be effective , folks need to lather up and then scrub for no less than 20 seconds before rinsing ( roughly the same amount of time it takes to twice run through happy birthday to you ). <PARA> those who don \u2019 t wash all that well or for long enough are putting still - germy hands under a blower . whether germs , microbes , or viruses could be blown off still - wet hands and into the surrounding air by such devices is an unanswered question , though . <PARA> paper towels offer a couple of advantages that electric hand dryers do not . since their use is frictional ( you rub your hands with them ), the act of drying with them can aid in the removal of some bacteria . also , given that the four most microbe - laden areas of public restrooms are the toilet , the floor around it , the counter area , and door and flush handles , using a paper towel on the door handle when exiting the restroom rather than handling it directly can keep one from coming into contact with one of microbial \u201c hot spots \u201d of such venues . <PARA> however , paper towels also have their microbial downside as used ones are discarded in bins , which means whatever got wiped onto them is now lurking in a communal garbage can , happily multiplying away in that warm , damp environment . <PARA> one downside inherent to hand dryers is that folks tend not to use them correctly . whether it \u2019 s the noise , or a sense of the user \u2019 s being made the center of attention , or just the amount of time such air blasting takes , people tend not to keep their hands under the blower until drying is complete , instead preferring to walk away with damp hands . ( which defeats the purpose , in that wet hands pick up microbes the way a magnet picks up iron filings .) <PARA> a study by the mayo clinic in 2000 found that four potential drying methods \u2014 paper towel , cloth roller towel , warm - forced - air dryer and \u201c spontaneous room air evaporation \u201d \u2014 were all about equal in removing bacteria . <PARA> barbara \u201c the drying game \u201d mikkelson",

        "text": "<MASK> : one of the less appetizing aspects of modern life is having to entrust our personal safety and wellbeing to those responsible for churning out household and personal care items . precious little of the process of bringing these items to market is transparent , and the products that end up in our hands arrive emblazoned with lengthy lists of polysyllabic ingredients that make the task of working out exactly what went into them almost impossible . ultimately , we have to cross our fingers and hope that the manufacturers have done right by us . but even so , there is always that little nagging sense that all might not be entirely well with many of the items we use on a daily basis . <PARA> <MASK> about icky or even dangerous substances lurking in ordinary household and personal products are our way of voicing that sense of disquiet , thus we fret that <PARA> our shampoo causes cancer , our scrubbing sponges contain formaldehyde , and our lipsticks are loaded with lead ( and even go so far as to worry about how much lip goo women swallow in their lifetimes ). we also fret ( needlessly , it turns out ) that our mascara contains bat poop . <PARA> this <MASK> \u2019 s <MASK> lies with a similarity between two words that causes them to be confused for one another : guano and guanine . <PARA> mascara contains the crystalline form of guanine , a word that derives from the spanish word guano , meaning \u201c dung .\u201d guanine is used extensively in the cosmetics industry , where it functions as a colorant and as an opacifying ( shimmering or light diffusing ) agent . it \u2019 s found in bath products , cleansing products , fragrances , hair conditioners , lipsticks , nail products , shampoos and skin care products . the crystalline guanine used in beauty products doesn \u2019 t derive from excrement , though , either from bats or from any other critter . yet there is a bit of a \u201c yuck !\u201d factor to that ingredient , as guanine is manufactured from fish scales , which means you \u2019 re likely finding a little bit of nemo in your cosmetics drawer . <PARA> the personal care products council ( formerly the cosmetic toiletry and fragrance association ) labels the <MASK> about bat guano in mascara as <MASK> : \u201c the color additive guanine is approved by the fda and listed in the code of federal regulations ,\u201d said that organization \u2019 s irene malbin . \u201c by law , guanine must be derived from fish scales . it is not derived from guano . in addition , there are no guano - or feces - based ingredients used in any cosmetics .\u201d <PARA> bat guano has commercial uses , but not in the cosmetics industry . instead , highly regarded fertilizer is made from bat droppings because this type of excrement is incredibly rich in nitrogen . ( thanks to its nitrogen richness , bat guano was at one time used in the manufacture of explosives .) <PARA> bat poop or not , mascara can be a dangerous beautifier if handled carelessly . application problems routinely cause the product to end up in the eyes of users as well as on their lashes , resulting in numerous emergency room visits ( 2 , 390 in 1983 , for example ). among the mishaps that bring people into the er with mascara - related injuries are slips of the applicator , which can injure or irritate the eye , sometimes resulting in infection . bacterial contamination of the product also can represent a danger . in extreme cases , dermatologists report , mascara has caused allergic reactions or inflammation of the conjunctiva , the mucous membrane lining the eyelids . <PARA> the cosmetic , toiletry and fragrance association offers these safety tips on mascara use : <PARA> the \u201c bat poop \u201d <MASK> isn \u2019 t the only one we \u2019 ve heard about mascara , even though it is the most prevalent . such <MASK> include the following : <PARA> i was told that all <MASK> mascaras have tar . <PARA> a <MASK> is going around that mascara is made from aborted babies . <PARA> upon getting ready for school this morning , my 12 year old daughter informed me that her mascara was made with monkey eyeballs . <PARA> barbara \u201c monkey in the middle school \u201d mikkelson",

        "text": "<MASK> : daniel somers was singer / guitarist with the phoenix rock band lisa savidge . he was also a u . s . army veteran who , as described by gawker : <PARA> [ somers ] was part of task force lightning , an intelligence unit . in 2004 - 2005 , he was mainly assigned to a tactical human - intelligence team ( tht ) in baghdad , iraq , where he ran more than 400 combat missions as a machine gunner in the turret of a humvee , interviewed countless iraqis ranging from concerned citizens to community leaders and and government officials , and interrogated dozens of insurgents and terrorist suspects . in 2006 - 2007 , daniel worked with joint special operations command ( jsoc ) through his former unit in mosul where he ran the northern iraq intelligence center . his official role was as a senior analyst for the levant ( lebanon , syria , jordan , israel , and part of turkey ). <PARA> daniel sommers struggled with post - traumatic stress disorder ( ptsd ) stemming from his military service as well as a traumatic brain injury . on 10 june 2013 he took his own life , leaving behind a lengthy suicide note in which he detailed the suffering he experienced in his life after leaving the military and urged the u . s . government to offer more assistance to other struggling veterans : <PARA> i am sorry that it has come to this . <PARA> the fact is , for as long as i can remember my motivation for getting up every day has been so that you would not have to bury me . as things have continued to get worse , it has become clear that this alone is not a sufficient reason to carry on . the fact is , i am not getting better , i am not going to get better , and i will most certainly deteriorate further as time goes on . from a logical standpoint , it is better to simply end things quickly and let any repercussions from that play out in the short term than to drag things out into the long term . <PARA> you will perhaps be sad for a time , but over time you will forget and begin to carry on . far better that than to inflict my growing misery upon you for years and decades to come , dragging you down with me . it is because i love you that i can not do this to you . you will come to see that it is a far better thing as one day after another passes during which you do not have to worry about me or even give me a second thought . you will find that your world is better without me in it . <PARA> i really have been trying to hang on , for more than a decade <MORE> fact is that any kind of ordinary life is an insult to those who died at my hand . how can i possibly go around like everyone else while the widows and orphans i created continue to struggle ? if they could see me sitting here in suburbia , in my comfortable home working on some music project they would be outraged , and rightfully so . <PARA> i thought perhaps i could make some headway with this film project , maybe even directly appealing to those i had wronged and exposing a greater truth , but that is also now being taken away from me . i fear that , just as with everything else that requires the involvement of people who can not understand by virtue of never having been there , it is going to fall apart as careers get in the way . <PARA> the last thought that has occurred to me is one of some kind of final mission . it is <MASK> that i have found that i am capable of finding some kind of reprieve by doing things that are worthwhile on the scale of life and death . while it is a nice thought to consider doing some good with my skills , experience , and killer instinct , the truth is that it isn \u2019 t realistic . first , there are the logistics of financing and equipping my own operation , then there is the near certainty of a grisly death , international incidents , and being branded a terrorist in the media that would follow . what is really stopping me , though , is that i simply am too sick to be effective in the field anymore . that , too , has been taken from me . <PARA> thus , i am left with basically nothing . too trapped in a war to be at peace , too damaged to be at war . abandoned by those who would take the easy route , and a liability to those who stick it out \u2014 and thus deserve better . so you see , not only am i better off dead , but the world is better without me in it <PARA> this is what brought me to my actual final mission . not suicide , but a mercy killing . i know how to kill , and i know how to do it so that there is no pain whatsoever . it was quick , and i did not suffer . and above all , now i am free . i feel no more pain . i have no more nightmares or flashbacks or hallucinations . i am no longer constantly depressed or afraid or worried <PARA> i am free . <PARA> i ask that you be happy for me for that . it is perhaps the best break i could have hoped for . please accept this and be glad for me . <PARA> daniel somers",

cnn explained it wasn \u2019 t the case that the vehicles of other residents of the community in which larison resided at the time of the controversy sported obama stickers , and those decals were singled out as the one allowable type of car decal . rather , a vehicle with an obama campaign sticker was cited as a single example , among several others , of cars that were supposedly in violation the homeowners association \u2019 s \u201c no decal \u201d policy but didn \u2019 t trigger warnings to their owners . one automobile decal touted a law school alma mater , another expressed a preference for titleist golf products , and yet another supported the 2008 obama / biden ticket : <PARA> we have the dallas fraternal order of police . we found another car in the neighborhood there that showed a photo of obama and biden \u2019 08 . then we found this one here , this is my personal favorite , because i \u2019 <MORE> serves for our military . they \u2014 they sacrificed more than i can even imagine . so , with that said , you know , the fact is that this was blown way out of proportion because it had nothing to do with it being marine stickers . we didn \u2019 t send it out to him because he was \u2014 <PARA> phillips : but that was never mentioned , art . i mean , nobody else has received a letter . no one else has been told they \u2019 d be fined or their car would be towed . nothing was mentioned about the fact that these were military stickers . the fact is , frank is being cornered on this one and we can \u2019 t seem to get a hold of your president , dorenda hardy . <PARA> you are speaking out . what i want to know are you going to stick everybody to these rules or are you going to drop these silly rules and let frank have his decals like everybody else in the neighborhood has their decals ?

( or , if you must , skip the next three paragraphs to transition directly to the u . s . portion of the <MASK> .) <PARA> the euro is the official currency of the european union , a supranational union comprising 27 member <MASK> , and is the sole currency for more than 317 million people . ( not every eu member country has chosen to adopt the euro ; some continue to use their traditional currencies .) <PARA> the move to a single currency in europe comes with both advantages and disadvantages . on the plus side , it does away with the cost of exchanging money , thereby leaving more cash in the pockets of both individual consumers and businesses . it also puts an end to the trouble of having to change one \u2019 s currency into that of the country being traveled to or traded with , then having to change it back again afterwards \u2014 one simply uses the same wad of bills . and it ends fluctuations in the value of one country \u2019 s money in relation to that of another : when only one currency is used , a cross - border deal struck for a specified amount of cash does not suddenly go up or down in price as the financial markets move , thereby ruining one party to the deal while dropping a windfall into the undeserving lap of the other . <PARA> on <MORE> have a few proponents , it is a long way from being taken seriously , let alone being regarded as a good idea . <PARA> which brings us to the question of the \u201c amero ,\u201d the name bestowed upon the hypothetical currency such a union would use as its common specie . in 1999 , a professor of economics at simon fraser university in vancouver published the case for the amero , a study that advanced the idea that the <PARA> three north american countries would be better served by their having a common currency . and there the matter rests , or at least it did before designs computed thought to add to its catalogue of commemorative coins , medals , and tokens a suite of ameros , a series of collectible coins struck from its concept of what coinage for such a currency might look like . designs computed is very clear on its web site that its ameros are in fact \u201c private - issue fantasy pattern coins [ that ] will be struck as an annual series ,\u201d and indeed is already offering some of them for sale . neither the u . s . mint nor the u . s . treasury had a hand in creating these \u201c ameros .\u201d these coins are merely collectibles offered to the buying public by a private company in the business of manufacturing such curiosities . <PARA> on 31 august 2007 , radio host hal turner used images of the amero tokens offered by designs computed as the basis for propagating a patently <MASK> tale about his having been given a \u201c real \u201d amero coin on the sly by an anonymous treasury agent , and that the existence of said coin was \u201c <MASK> \u201d that the usa , canada , and mexico were \u201c to be merged into a single new entity \u201d known as the north american union . <PARA> after we ( and others ) debunked turner \u2019 s fictional , outrage - provoking conspiracy theory by pointing out the <MASK> <MASK> of the amero tokens , he began <MASK> that the designs computed site had been hastily erected on the internet as part of \u201c a full blown effort to discredit my <MASK> and the images as fake .\u201d that was not the case : daniel carr , the entrepreneur behind designs computed , has been displaying the coins he has designed on his web site since at least 2000 and has been offering some of them for sale since at least 2005 . while his \u201c amero \u201d entry dates only to 2007 , the coins depicted thereon fit seamlessly into his catalogue of similar offerings , including his \u201c parody <MASK> quarters .\u201d <PARA> ( do have a look at some of his \u201c parody <MASK> quarters ,\u201d particularly maine \u2018 s and colorado \u2018 s , which especially tickled our fancy .) <PARA> barbara \u201c maine event \u201d mikkelson",

( we will , for now , ignore the fact that arrests are not the same as convictions , and note that we did not factor in leap days .) so the numbers in the <MASK> fall flat on both the number of murders committed and the arrests and convictions associated with those murders . <PARA> in march 2018 an arizona woman , mary ann mendoza , reportedly related to the president the <MASK> that \u201c 63 , 000 \u201d united <MASK> citizens had been killed by undocumented immigrants . mendoza \u2019 s son was killed in 2014 by an undocumented drunk driver . <PARA> although the president has attempted to cast immigrants as criminals since he first announced his candidacy in june 2015 , various analyses have already undermined the notion that people in the united <MASK> without documentation were more likely to commit crimes in general than those born in the country . one of those studies , published in february 2018 by the libertarian group cato institute , examined data on criminal convictions in texas for 2015 and found that : <PARA> although the trump administration has called immigration at the southern u . s . border a \u201c crisis \u201d that has a deleterious effect on public safety , unauthorized border crossings are currently the lowest they have been in decades and studies have consistently disproved links between immigration and crime . further most of the families who crossed during enforcement of trump \u2019 s \u201c zero tolerance \u201d policy were charged with misdemeanors .",

<PARA> oftentimes it \u2019 s the tail ends of these stories which make the difference between cute ones which get told once or twice then drop out of sight , and ones such as this , which get forwarded all over the world . the floor cleaner \u2019 s mistake is bad enough ; what sends this <MASK> over the top is the callous matter - of - factness of the hospital . what does it say about health care in south africa ? <PARA> summer 1996 saw this hilarious yet chilling account take the internet by storm . in an <MASK> purportedly from the 13 june 1996 cape times (\u201c cleaner polishes off patients \u201d), it quickly became the <MASK> of the moment . various publications picked it up and ran it as a news item , adding to the legend \u2019 s credibility . <PARA> bottom line : no matter how many papers you might have read that said different , there were no friday massacres in pelonomi hospital , no murdering floor cleaners , no overly - callous hospital spokespeople imperiously intoning , \u201c the enquiry is now closed .\u201d it \u2019 s folklore , pure and simple \u2014 a tall tale that got loose , then went on a rampage . <PARA> how did this amazing <MASK> come to be taken as a news item ? as always , through a misunderstanding . the legend had been around forever , so die volksblad ( a small yet widely - circulated rural south african newspaper ) took it upon itself to get to the bottom of this persistent <MASK> . part of that effort to uncover the truth resulted in a die volksblad <MASK> asking those related to the victim ( s ) to come forward . <PARA> that <MASK> was picked up by die burger , and it was die burger \u2019 s <MASK> which cape times got its hands on . in much the same way children playing a game of \u201c telephone \u201d will invariably garble the message , cape times \u2018 version came out as a news <MASK> , not as a rural paper \u2019 s attempt to sort fact from fiction . from there the tale went to other publications , very few of whom bothered to check either with pelonomi hospital or die volksblad . <PARA> those journalists who checked with cape times ( and not all of them did even this much ) were told that yes <MORE> times <MASK> weren \u2019 t the same . the internet version had been greatly embellished , further garbling the already hopelessly garbled and creating by the stroke of a few electrons a suitably cold - hearted but entirely fictional spokeswoman for pelonomi hospital . <PARA> from there on in , it became a zoo , with publications such as new scientist and the sunday telegraph <MASK> this as a news item . and why not indeed ? cape times was telling them it was . <PARA> south african folklorist arthur goldstuck was involved with this tale almost from the moment it appeared . his fascinating \u201c cleaner polishes off patient \u201d faq is filled with an incredible depth of detail about this legend . <PARA> although the \u201c murdering south african floor cleaner \u201d tale was new in 1996 , its basic plot was as old as the hills , as demonstrated by this anecdote from a 1967 issue of reader \u2019 s digest : <PARA> once again , a dull - witted office cleaner is said to have upset technology \u2019 s applecart while discharging her janitorial duties . the charwoman does not recognize the \u201c special model \u201d serves a particular purpose \u2014 she views it merely as something she can fill her bucket from and uses it as such . likewise , the south african floor cleaner perceives the loaded outlet in intensive care only as a place to plug in a needed piece of cleaning equipment \u2014 recognition that whatever is already occupying that outlet might be important eludes him . <PARA> the theme of both these stories appears in another tale collected in 1993 , this one poking fun not at office cleaners , but at office workers . <PARA> an additional thread ties all of these stories together . it \u2019 s no accident these legends are told about janitors and secretaries : they are considered lesser beings in the world of labor and are often presumed to be of lower intelligence . in each of these tales , someone from the bottom rungs of the corporate ladder who has access to key equipment but lacks so much as a basic understanding of its function and importance screws the pooch . such tales confirm the commonly - held stereotypes of those who hold those jobs . <PARA> given how prevalent similar tales are , there was very little excuse for the journalistic outpouring the south african floor cleaner <MASK> provoked in 1996 . ( one need not hear a joke told the same way each time to recognize it as the same joke , after all .) this mess proved so very conclusively that even newspapermen fall victim to \u2018 i read it in the paper , so it must be <MASK> .\u201d <PARA> sightings : this legend figures in an episode of the british police drama a touch of frost (\u201c benefit of the doubt ,\u201d <MASK> air date 15 january 2001 ).",

four of the 112 were under the age of 18 . <PARA> five of the 112 were not accounted for in voter databases due to missing information , and of the entire sample an amended 34 ( not 35 or 36 ) were purportedly registered to vote in the <MASK> of oregon but did not return ballots . at very best , it seemed that 34 of the 112 arrestees were registered to vote but did not cast a ballot in the 2016 general election ( but still , that information was not fully vetted or verified ). <PARA> finally , the <MASK> was often condensed to \u201c protesters ,\u201d when post - election demonstrations occurred in cities across the united <MASK> . the scope of kgw \u2019 s check of election records was restricted to the <MASK> of oregon and the city of portland , bearing little relevance to the overall proportion of voter participation among demonstrations nationwide .",

        "text": "fact check do blue lines painted on curbs signify a residence where a police officer can reliably find \u201c back - up \u201d? <PARA> mixture <PARA> <MASK> : the period 2014 - 15 saw an ongoing public debate in the united <MASK> about police and policing : one faction held that corruption among law enforcement was rife and the cause of unnecessary civilian deaths at the hands of police , while another held that americans were increasingly at war with cops and unappreciative of their difficult jobs and their sacrifices . ( social media <MASK> about rudeness to police often seem to quickly follow high profile controversies involving police and race , such as the death of eric garner or the mckinney pool party incident .) <PARA> one thread of that debate suggested that the focus of reactive movements such as \u201c black lives matter \u201d was essentially attacking police . in response , on 9 september 2015 facebook user anthony welichko posted the example shown above , proposing an idea to support police that he dubbed the \u201c safe harbor initiative .\u201d ( the idea later carried over to a number of september 2015 blog posts titled \u201c have you seen blue strip on curb ? here \u2019 s the incredible reason behind it .\u201d) <PARA> the \u201c safe harbor \u201d proposal is clearly well - intentioned , and the person who asked social media users to share it meant only to encourage a broadly adoptable method of showing support for police officers . however , its functional application is somewhat unsound and ill - suited for the purpose it \u2019 s supposed to serve . <PARA> one issue with this proposal is that curb markers are often used by agencies such as public works departments to indicate locations work sites or important structural information . one example comes from bozeman , montana , where the very same signal illustrated in the \u201c safe harbor \u201d proposal was already in use : <PARA> bozeman is presumably not the only location wherein public works officials utilize painted strips of blue on curbs as internal signals . adopting that system to show moral support for police would create confusion over whether such markings were related to law enforcement protection or infrastructural projects . <PARA> additionally , blue strips painted on curbs are not particularly visible during non - daylight hours . it \u2019 s not reasonable to expect that police responding to evening or nighttime calls will first examine neighborhood curbsides with their flashlights to determine whether they have any community support in the area . <PARA> another matter is whether or not the proposal is ( or ever will be ) known outside of a few thousand shares on facebook . unless and until it is a widely used ( or at least widely recognized ) system , it will not be recognizable or useful to police . <PARA> finally , any form of reliance on such an informal and <MORE> ) sense of security ? if not , it \u2019 s unlikely that police would ever gain much benefit or place any reliance on the use of such symbols . <PARA> aside from all of those issues , just how are civilians supposed to provide \u201c back - up \u201d or \u201c have [ an officer \u2019 s back ]\u201d during a hypothetical adversarial event or crime in progress ? police everywhere ( while typically grateful for public support ) are pretty firm about urging well - meaning civilians not to interfere with law enforcement activities . routinely , cops emphatically request that civilians present at crime scenes assist merely by staying out of the way and closely following their instructions , not by leaping in to serve as untrained \u201c back - up .\u201d <PARA> police departments across the united <MASK> ( examples here , here , here , here , here , and here [ pdf , pdf ]) are consistent and firm in their guidance on this matter : civilians should not intervene with crimes in progress , especially when police are already on the scene . those who do may end up injured ( potentially fatally ), and untrained intervention poses severe risk to both other civilians and responding officers . this reason alone is enough to be extremely cautious about spreading the \u201c blue strip \u201d <MASK> , as the police require cooperation with the commands they \u2019 ve issued to bystanders more than they need encouragement for the public to act as crime scene cheerleaders . <PARA> while the \u201c safe harbor initiative \u201d/ blue strip curb paint idea was one borne of a desire to show support for police , for many reasons the proposed practice is likely to be of negligible benefit to any officers . most important , the message encourages a practice police departments universally disdain : civilian intervention in crimes in progress . well - meaning , untrained civilians who \u2019 ve taken it upon themselves to \u201c help \u201d the police are generally more of a burden and hindrance than anything else , so if you think police might need your help during an event , it \u2019 s best to wait for them to ask you for assistance . <PARA> it \u2019 s understandable that folks are moved to give back to hard - working police officers across the country , and one quora user ( who is also a retired cop ) offered a list of safe ways for civilians to do so without interfering with police activity : <PARA> \u201c slacktivist \u201d initiatives such as painting blue strips on curbs may give a temporary feeling of accomplishment , but those truly concerned with the plight of police officers would do better to donate to law enforcement charities or volunteer in an official capacity where civilian hands are needed ( and wanted ). last updated : 15 september 2015 <PARA> first published : 15 september 2015",
