( which makes perfect sense when you think about it : if you were a pickpocket or mugger , wouldn \u2019 t you be inspired to hang about relatively unsupervised outdoor locations where potential victims go to load themselves up with cash ?) it therefore pays to stay alert to one \u2019 s surroundings when using these <PARA> machines . <PARA> there are precautions folks can take to lessen their chances of being victimized when using atm or cashpoint machines . while some work to protect users from having their financial information stolen and others to lessen the chances of being mugged at the machines , they all bear taking to heart :",

        "text": "versions of a \u201c walmart cash back scam \u201d warning have been circulating since late 2004 , all of them featuring the scenario of a walmart customer who uses a credit / debit card that is charged for a cash back amount even though the shopper did not request cash back and was handed no cash by the cashier , with the discrepancy being noticed only when the shopper spots the added cash back amount on the receipt : <PARA> in concept , this item was similar to an earlier piece which spread the <MASK> <MASK> that gas <MASK> were imposing surreptitious $ 10 . 00 surcharges on credit card customers . the similarity is that in both cases , it appears that an erroneous \u201c scam \u201d <MASK> <MASK> because a customer misunderstood or misinterpreted something that happened to her while shopping and , despite not having any <MASK> of a deliberate attempt to defraud , was quick to write and circulate a message erroneously accusing retailers of wrongdoing . <PARA> we investigated a number of different walmart stores in different areas ( along with outlets of other general merchandising and grocery store chains ), and we spoke with ( both in person and via e - mail ) numerous people who were currently working as cashiers for a number of different retailers , including walmart . in not one single case did we find a store with a checkout system that allowed cashiers to initiate cash back transactions on customers \u2019 cards on their own , without any involvement , knowledge , or approval on the customer \u2019 s part . there was simply no way for a cashier working at any of these businesses to surreptitiously place a cash back charge on a customer \u2019 s card and furtively pocket the money , all without the customer \u2019 s requesting or knowing about it . as various walmart cashiers told us : <PARA> in every case of customers \u2019 complaining about getting cash back from credit / debit card purchases without having requested it that we were able to track down , the cause turned out to be that those customers didn \u2019 t pay close enough attention to the prompts on the card processing keypads or simply pressed the wrong keys by mistake . and in nearly every one of those cases it was verifiable that the complaining customers had in fact been handed the appropriate amount of cash back by their cashiers ( even though they insisted they hadn \u2019 t requested it ). <PARA> it is possible ( and sometimes occurs ) that a cashier will actually reach over and manipulate the customer keypad herself to initiate a cash back request unbeknownst to the customer , but this form of theft requires that the customer \u2019 s attention be completely diverted elsewhere , and it can \u2019 t be done surreptitiously \u2014 the action takes place in full view of other employees , customer , and security cameras ( and hence such perpetrators are easily caught ).",

        "text": "in late january 2019 , a chain message with the subject \u201c why does trump want this wall so badly ?\u201d began to spread through inboxes , on social media , and on reddit . the answer , according to an anonymous author , was that \u201c the steel slats trump wants to use ... are manufactured in the u . s . by a steel mill co - owned by a russian - israeli billionaire named roman abramovich .\u201d: <PARA> these three paragraphs blended factual <MASK> about abramovich with unverified assertions to create a narrative at odds with reality . for this narrative to be <MASK> , each of the following <MASK> would need to be <MASK> : <PARA> it is <MASK> that abramovich is a well - connected russian oligarch with some ties to the trump family , and it is <MASK> that abramovich owns the only mill in the united <MASK> capable of producing 480 - foot , steel rails ( a product touted for its utility in the train industry ). however , president trump , who has changed his view multiple times on what his wall should look like , has not once made \u201c 480 - foot steel rails \u201d an immutable part of that plan . this conspiracy theory hinges primarily on that final <MASK> assertion . <PARA> roman abramovich is a russian - israeli billionaire who , among other things , owns the chelsea premier league football club and is also the largest shareholder of the multinational , russian - based steel company evraz . after being granted israeli citizenship in may 2018 , abramovich became the world \u2019 s richest israeli . he is identified as a russian oligarch ( based on his \u201c closeness to the russian regime and ... net worth \u201d) and appears on a u . s . treasury list produced as part of sanctions legislation president trump reluctantly signed into law . abramovich \u2019 s presence on this list does not necessarily mean he is subject to u . s . sanctions , though . <PARA> abramovich is friendly with the trump family , mainly through his wife , dasha zhukova . in 2014 , ivanka trump and jared kushner spent four days in russia at the invitation of zhukova , where \u201c they sat at the same table along with a few other people during a high - powered fundraising dinner for moscow \u2019 s jewish museum ,\u201d according to bloomberg . jared kushner , bloomberg reported , had also been invested in an art business whose founding partner was zhukova , and \u201c ivanka trump , kushner and his brother , joshua , have accompanied zhukova to sporting events in the new york area .\u201d zhukova , a politico reporter noted , attended the trump inauguration as a guest of ivanka trump . <PARA> abramovich \u2019 s steel background has inspired past speculation about possible quid - pro - quos between the trump administration <MORE> regardless of design , will involve large quantities of steel which could theoretically be produced by a u . s .- based , evraz - owned steel mill . but the supposed \u201c smoking gun \u201d link in support of the notion that the steel it will have to produced by evraz is that president trump \u2019 s latest wall machination supposedly requires the use of \u201c 480 sq ft steel rails \u201d ( which we interpret to mean \u201c 480 - foot - long steel rails \u201d, as the latter is actually a real commodity ). <PARA> such a requirement would certainly be provocative , as it does appear that one evraz - owned steel mill in colorado is the only such facility within the united <MASK> capable of producing that length of rail . the train industry is quite interested in these super - long rail lengths , as they reduce the amount of welding required for track construction or repairs . in november 2006 , the denver post reported on evraz \u2019 s acquisition of the colorado - based rocky mountain steel company , <MASK> that it would become the only american facility to produce those 480 - foot - length rail sections : <PARA> the only problem ? we have not identified a single instance of president trump \u2019 s <MASK> a requirement that the border wall use 480 - foot - length steel rails , nor have we found any rationale for why such a length would be efficacious in border wall construction . trump \u2019 s descriptions of his proposed border wall have shifted repeatedly since it was first raised as a talking point on 5 august 2014 , and such descriptions have never been heavy on technical specifics . during most of the 2016 presidential campaign trump described his barrier as a concrete wall , but in an about - face he said in late 2018 that the wall would be made with \u201c artistically designed steel slats ,\u201d tweeting a rudimentary design of such a \u201c steel slat barrier \u201d on 21 december 2018 : <PARA> using this schematic and some basic math , the washington post \u2018 s philip bump calculated that the barrier proposed by president trump in this version of his plans would be built using 28 . 4 - feet - high by 10 - inch - wide steel slats with 13 - inch spikes on top , separated from each other by a 9 - inch gap . none of this , to our ears , screams \u201c 480 sq foot steel rails .\u201d <PARA> the notion that trump and abramovich are corruptly colluding to provide a massive contract for a russian - based steel company via a steel southern border wall ( whose existence , let alone design , has yet to be approved in congress ) appears to be unfounded speculation rooted in a manufacturing requirement for the wall that trump never actually <MASK> .",

( if the post was published in december 2014 , the poster may have been exposed to the then - circulating photograph and presented the <MASK> as her own .) <PARA> two separate complaints of gel balls or other debris found in gerber snack foods have appeared on a consumer complaints forum . on 12 june 2012 , one user wrote : <PARA> i bought the gerber good start gentle powdered formula and about the 4 bottle into it , i noticed something shiny in the tub . i shook the tub around until it came to the surface and noticed a ball of some sort . i picked it out with my finger and gave it a little squeeze and green stuff started coming out . i became grossed out and dropped it into my kitchen sink and soon as it became wet it flattened out into a green substance . it looked like a bodily fluid once it became flattened . i was so disgusted . i immediately took a picture with my cell phone and took the container back to the store where i purchased it the day before . <PARA> and on 20 december 2014 , another user complained that : <PARA> i poured my son a snack of gerber puffs today and this little piece of what looked to be green glass or plastic fell out of the container . i couldn \u2019 t believe my eyes . what if my son had been snacking out of the container on his own and ate the item . i immediately called the company . the lady i spoke to was friendly . she said someone would contact me on monday to schedule a time when someone can pick it up to analyze the object . she also told me she would send me an email so i could email them a picture of the item . i haven \u2019 t received that email yet . i really hope they take this seriously because i am extremely upset . <PARA> however , those complaints seemed to involve a markedly different contaminant : none of the described debris was the sort of thing one might reasonably expect to find in food , nor were they clearly discernable by - products of the manufacturing process ( such as dust , metal , glass , or preservatives ). in response to one of what was likely many posts to gerber \u2019 s facebook regarding the <MASK> , the brand replied : <PARA> hi emily , thank you for contacting us . we want to assure you all gerber foods are safe and we talked to cassandra about this concern this past fall . thanks . <PARA> we contacted gerber to ask about complaints of gel balls found in graduates puffs , and according to a company representative gerber reached out to the <MASK> poster about her complaint but was unable to verify her <MASK> . gerber said that the circulating facebook post was the only instance of such a complaint reaching the brand so far .",

they reported this stunning news : we have more oil inside our borders , than all the other proven reserves on earth . here are <MORE> mean value of 3 . 65 billion barrels . scientists conducted detailed studies in stratigraphy and structural geology and the modeling of petroleum geochemistry . they also combined their findings with historical exploration and production analyses to determine the undiscovered , technically recoverable oil estimates . <PARA> certainly 3 . 65 billion barrels of recoverable oil is nothing to sneeze at , but a little perspective is in order . the u . s . currently imports an average of about 10 million barrels of oil per day ( for a total of about 3 . 65 billion barrels of oil per year ), so even if all the estimated undiscovered oil in the bakken formation were extracted today , it would only be enough to wean the u . s . off of crude oil imports for one year . that \u2019 s still a good thing , but it \u2019 s not nearly \u201c enough crude to fully fuel the american economy for 41 years straight \u201d as <MASK> above . <PARA> as for the second part of the <MASK> , a 2005 study co - authored by james t . bartis for the rand corporation ( a nonprofit research organization ) noted that estimates had placed upper range of shale oil resources to be found within the green river formation range of colorado , utah , and wyoming at between 1 . 5 and 1 . 8 trillion barrels . however , the report also <MASK> that not all of that oil was recoverable and offered a midpoint estimate of about 800 billion barrels of recoverable oil shale resources . moreover , the report also noted that even under \u201c high growth assumptions ,\u201d an oil shale production level of 1 million barrels per day ( about 10 % of the amount of oil the u . s . currently imports daily ) is \u201c probably more than 20 years in the future ,\u201d and depends upon scientists overcoming some substantial obstacles first : <PARA> but development of the resource hinges on overcoming economic , technical and environmental obstacles , bartis said . <PARA> \u201c no work has been done on the impacts of development and ways to mitigate those impacts ,\u201d he said . <PARA> for example , shale development requires large expenditures of water and energy , produces air pollution and carbon emissions and leaves toxic byproducts that could endanger the environment . <PARA> \u201c no work has been done on the impacts of development and ways to mitigate those impacts ,\u201d he said . <PARA> for example , shale development requires large expenditures of water and energy , produces air pollution and carbon emissions and leaves toxic byproducts that could endanger the environment . <PARA> according to news accounts , although new drilling techniques have greatly increased oil production in bakken formation in recent years , as of february 2011 that region was still yielding less than half a million barrels per day .",

        "text": "the \u201c chicken cannon \u201d legend has reached us in several different forms over the years , as demonstrated by the following examples : <PARA> there is at least one minor shred of truth in the chicken cannon tale : the <MASK> did run in the november 1995 issue of feathers , the california poultry industry federation \u2019 s ( cpif ) newsletter . that doesn \u2019 t mean the cpif vetted it , though . they had picked it up \u2014 the same way everyone else had \u2014 from a friend of a friend . further adding to the confusion over the validity of this tale , army lt . gen . wes clark <MASK> the <MASK> was real on a number of occasions and was fond of using the anecdote in speeches . <PARA> much as we hate to disagree with anyone with an army behind him , we just have to . the basic <MASK> ( frozen bird fired by nincompoops ) has been around for years , with the details always in flux . one researcher spotted a 1990 version , except in it those foolish british train engineers were said to be american jet engine designers , so the frozen chicken was fired not at a train window but at a jet engine . a 1988 book about australian urban legends contained our chicken cannon tale , and in that version , once again american engineers testing a jet engine mistakenly fired a frozen chicken at it with disastrous results . that 1988 sighting of our legend described it as \u201c an old legend of uncertain <MASK> \u201d which \u201c re - emerged briefly in australia after the space shuttle disaster of january 1986 .\u201d <PARA> the chicken gun ( also known as the chicken cannon , turkey gun , or rooster booster ) has been around since 1972 . it \u2019 s used for the \u201c chicken ingestion test ,\u201d one of a series of stress tests required by the federal aviation administration before a new jet engine design can be certified . the tests take place in a concrete building large enough to enclose an entire jet engine . with the engine operating at full speed , the cannon uses compressed air to shoot chicken carcasses into the turbine at 180 mph . ( the air force is known to launch its poultry projectiles at 400 mph into f - 16 canopies .) <PARA> bird strikes can cause extensive damage to aircraft and serious injuries to their crews . at worst , they can be deadly confrontations . the air force estimates that planes hit about 3 , 000 birds every year , causing damages of $ 50 million and sometimes loss of human life . in a bird - strike accident in september 1995 , 24 awacs crew members were killed after takeoff from elmendorf air force base , alaska . <PARA> some engineers prefer to go for realism in these tests and thus buy still - feathered firing fowl from game farms . ( er , at this point i should mention the birds are dead when cannonized .) others , however , buy their catapulting poultry at the supermarket . those who favor using thawed birds keep the carcasses frozen until just before test time , when a session in the microwave restores the avian missiles to a more natural condition . not everyone fires thawed birds : before switching to fake birds , the u . s . air force traditionally launched frozen ones . ( sensitive to the concerns of animal - rights activists , they now fling birds made of clay and plastic at canopies and engines .) the way the air force had it figured , if a canopy could survive an impact with a frozen bird , it would certainly live through a chance introduction to one that could still fly under its own power . they further believed cold chickens provided a better simulation of a bird that had tensed to prepare for the impact . <PARA> that at least one high profile group of chicken flingers has used frozen poultry in its cannonizations puts this legend \u2019 s punch line \u2014 and thus the legend itself \u2014 into the realm of lore , not that of reality . clearly , it \u2019 s not all that intuitive to use thawed poultry in these tests . just as clearly , firing a frosted pullet bullet at something to be impact - tested isn \u2019 t all that unreasonable an action to take . <PARA> the legend \u2019 s appeal lies in its aura of smug superiority that \u201c we \u201d are smarter than \u201c them .\u201d we , says the legend , would have known to use thawed birds . moreover , when the other country screwed up , its engineers couldn \u2019 t figure out the error on their own . we thus earned even more of a mental pat on the back in that it was our engineers who had to explain the \u201c obvious \u201d to these brainless foreigners . <PARA> <!\u2013 <PARA> variations :",

        "text": "<MASK> : the issue over whether <MASK> should recognize same - sex marriages or allow for civil unions that extend same - sex couples the same benefits and rights as married male - female couples remains controversial . vermont recently implemented the nation \u2019 s first civil union system to provide the equivalent rights and benefits of heterosexual marriage to same - sex couples , and five other <MASK> legislatures ( rhode island , connecticut , washington , hawaii , and california ) have considered similar measures . in response , thirty - five other <MASK> ( and the federal government ) have adopted \u201c defense of marriage laws \u201d to define marriage specifically as a union between a man and a woman . in july 2001 , the group alliance for marriage began to promote the passage of a federal marriage amendment to legislate that \u201c marriage in the united <MASK> shall consist only of the union of a man and a woman ,\u201d an action that \u2014 if successful \u2014 could effectively prevent or overturn <MASK> laws recognizing same - sex marriages and civil unions . the petition linked above seeks to enlist support to prevent this from happening . <PARA> in order to become part of the constitution , an amendment must : <PARA> the federal marriage amendment was finally introduced on 15 may 2002 , but the <MASK> that it is being \u201c pushed through congress \u201d is somewhat misleading , as it implies that the amendment is being sneaked past unaware congressman or is likely to be passed due to the strong - arming efforts of its supporters . it hasn \u2019 t even come up for a vote yet ( and indeed , it may never be voted upon ), and fox news noted that the \u201c amendment has little chance of becoming the law of the land merely because of the obstacles a measure must overcome to change the constitution .\u201d ( since most democrats would presumably vote against such an amendment , and the composition of both the house and the senate is close to 50 - 50 , the chances of a two - thirds majority in both houses are rather slim .) <PARA> consider the following : <PARA> what \u2019 s the significance of all this ? politicians shy away from passing important laws like consitutional amendments that could cost them votes and deny them re - election . that \u2019 s why all the successful amendments in the last eight decades have dealt with the technicalities of holding office or laws affecting who can vote \u2014 politicians \u2019 passing amendments to govern themselves is politically safe , and politicians \u2019 allowing more people to vote generally garners them the support of the voters they just enfranchised . but for a long time time now , constitutional amendments involving social issues \u2014 even one as comparatively innocuous as the equal rights amendment \u2014 have been too controversial for comfort . <PARA> the bottom line is that it \u2019 s a very long way from \u201c some group wants to pass a constitutional amendment \u201d to actually amending the constitution , and the proposal discussed here isn \u2019 t even within sight of the finish line . dedicated efforts are indeed being made by both those who would like to pass this amendment and those who would like to defeat it , however , so citizens who feel strongly about the issue should certainly contact their representatives to make their views known .",

it instead governs the small amounts of pesticide residue allowed to remain in , or on , food products . these limits , termed maximum residue tolerances or limits ( mrls ) are different depending upon both the chemical used and the commodity type because the level of exposure to pesticide residue a consumer might experience through diet differs depending upon the food type . <PARA> in some cases , residue limits are set for dried tea , which is the type of testing highlighted in fraser \u2019 s <MASK> . setting such limits is a scientifically demanding process , and not all pesticides that show up in tests have established limits for dried tea products . in such cases , the presence of a pesticide - related chemical in the food commodity means the product is considered \u201c adulterated ,\u201d but that does not mean the product is necessarily subject to regulatory action , as explained to us via email by u . s . food and drug administration ( fda ) residue expert chris sack : <PARA> in essence , this means there are two ways to run afoul of food residue laws as they regard the trace presence of pesticide in food commodities . in cases where there are enough data and research to determine an mrl value for a specific pesticide , a food product can contain levels above a \u201c legally acceptable limit .\u201d in cases where no mrl is set for a certain chemical on a certain commodity , the mere presence ( above 0 . 01 ppm ) of that chemical is a violation of the law <MORE> larger number of pesticides existed in concentrations that had been medically evaluated to be harmful to humans , as opposed to counting only those chemicals whose presence alone constituted a violation . <PARA> propochlor is considered a human carcinogen under california \u2019 s proposition 65 , but every cup of coffee sold is considered a carcinogen under california law as well since the law is blind to the how much of a given chemical is present . <PARA> while allowable tolerances for propochlor exist in other products , no such limits have been established for tea , and therefore its presence in a children \u2019 s tea product ( if <MASK> ) should be troubling . the company faced widespread online backlash and a temporary reduction in share value as a result of the report . <PARA> for what it \u2019 s worth , hain - celestial described glaucus \u2019 s results as \u201c <MASK> and misleading \u201d and <MASK> they undertook to have the brands highlighted by the glaucus report retested , finding that no pesticides were detected : <PARA> after we reached out to fraser , she updated her post with more detail about some of the chemicals she highlighted . these updates , however , did not really take into account scale . for example , she highlighted endosulfan as an example of a dangerous level of a pesticide residue : <PARA> this <MASK> is <MASK> , but the cbc results she highlighted showed levels of endosulfan in tea at concentrations of 0 . 04 ppm . in the united <MASK> , endosulfan \u2019 s presence would not be a violation until it reached a concentration of 24 ppm , orders of magnitude higher than the level found in uncle lee \u2019 s legends of china green tea . <PARA> in short , the <MASK> of dangerous pesticides \u201c above the legal limit \u201d rely on incorrect or misleading descriptions of out - of - date testing that was performed in most cases by advocacy groups . these misleading and outdated descriptions were presented , at least in part , for the purpose of making a profit off people clicking online links for organic tea products and muddied the online discourse surrounding pesticide and food science . while the reports accurately highlighted the presence of some pesticide - related chemicals that do not have mrl limits set for dried tea contained in tea products , those reports in nearly all cases did not provide <MASK> of \u201c dangerous \u201d or \u201c deadly \u201d levels of those chemicals , just their trace presence . <PARA> \u201c it \u2019 s now almost 2019 ,\u201d fraser wrote in a 1 december 2018 update to her post , \u201c and seeing as how these studies were conducted over four years ago , it is hard to say whether they have changed up the pesticides they are using , or whether they have stopped using them at all .\u201d we concur .",

( that book also mistakenly cited mein kampf as the source of the <MASK> .) <PARA> aside from the fact that this <MASK> does not reflect something hitler ever said or wrote , it \u2019 s also <MASK> if simply considered as a shorthand version of what hitler thought and / or did . these words reflect a misperception that hitler \u2019 s political maneuvers on his way to seizing dictatorial control over germany were akin to the legend of the boiled frog , that hitler supposedly made a series of small , gradual changes in german law and government that chipped away at the rights of the citizenry over an extended period of time , avoiding any single large changes that might provoke resistance from the people until it was too late for them to effectively oppose him . <PARA> in fact , this is the historical opposite of what happened . once he gained a position of political authority in germany , hitler quickly headed down the road of consolidating power by making very large changes in a short period of time . <PARA> adolf hitler was appointed chancellor of germany by paul von hindenburg on 30 january 1933 . within a month , hitler used the occurrence of a fire at the reichstag building ( the assembly location of the german parliament ) as an excuse to urge von hindenburg to issue the reichstag fire decree ( the \u201c presidential order for the protection of people and <MASK> \u201d) that suspended civil rights , banned the left - wing press , and authorized the mass arrest of communists and socialists ( a move that also allowed the nazi party to assume a majority in the reichstag by taking the seats of arrested communist delegates ). before another month had passed , the nazi - majority reichstag passed the enabling act , which gave the german cabinet ( i . e ., chancellor hitler ) the power to enact laws without the involvement of the the reichstag . the combination of the reichstag fire decree and the enabling act effectively transformed hitler \u2019 s government into a legal dictatorship within two months of his appointment as chancellor . these actions were not \u201c imperceptible reductions \u201d in freedom and rights \u2014 they were a massive change in the established order implemented in a very short period of time . <PARA> within another few weeks , jewish businesses were openly attacked by the sa ( the nazi party \u2019 s paramilitary organization , commonly known as \u201c brown shirts \u201d or \u201c storm troopers \u201d) and a \u201c law for the restoration of the professional civil service \u201d was passed that banned all jews , non - germans , and political opponents from public service . a month later , trade unions were banned . within another few months , all political parties other than the nazi party were banned . all of this took place within the six - month period after hitler was appointed to the chancellor \u2019 s office , not \u201c imperceptibly .\u201d",

ridden chiron vaccine company . both of these companies have had agreements with the world health organization to produce a pandemic vaccine . <PARA> the baxter vaccine , called celvapan , has had fast track approval . it uses a new vero cell technology , which utilizes cultured cells from the african green monkey . this same animal tissue transmits a number of vaccine - contaminating viruses , including the hiv virus . <PARA> the baxter company has been associated with two deadly scandals . the first event occurred in 2006 when hemophiliac components were contaminated with hiv virus and injected in tens of thousands of people , including thousands of children . baxter continued to release the hiv contaminated vaccine even after the contamination was known . <PARA> the second event occurred recently when it was discovered that baxter had released a seasonal flu vaccine containing the bird flu virus , which would have produced a real world <PARA> pandemic , to 18 countries . fortunately , astute lab workers in the czech republic discovered the deadly combination and blew the whistle before a worldwide disaster was unleashed . <PARA> despite these two deadly events , who maintains an <MORE> by conventional medicine . it will mean a lifetime of crippling illness and early death . <PARA> there are much safer ways to protect oneself from this flu virus , such as higher doses of vitamin d3 , selective immune enhancement using supplements , and a good diet . <PARA> <MASK> : squalene is natural organic compound produced by all higher organisms ( including human beings ). squalene is sometimes used as an adjuvant in vaccines \u2014 that is , an agent that stimulates the immune system and increases the response to a vaccine . the warning reproduced above cautions that the swine flu vaccine \u201c is one of the most dangerous vaccines ever devised \u201d because it uses squalene as an adjuvant , and vaccines containing squalene have been proved to cause severe autoimmune disorders . it is wrong on both counts . <PARA> the <MASK> that vaccines containing squalene have been linked to severe autoimmune disorders is based on a study published in the journal experimental and molecular pathology in 2000 which found squalene antibodies in gulf war veterans who had received anthrax vaccines before being deployed . however , as noted by the world health organization ( who ), that study has been criticized as flawed for a number of reasons , not least of which is that the anthrax vaccines administered to the subjects of the study did not contain squalene : <PARA> a few people have tried to link the health problems of gulf war veterans to the possible presence of squalene in the vaccines these soldiers received . one published report suggested that some veterans who received anthrax vaccines developed anti - squalene antibodies and these antibodies caused disabilities . <PARA> it is now known that squalene was not added to the vaccines administered to these veterans , and technical deficiencies in the report suggesting an association have been published . most adults , whether or not they have received vaccines containing squalene , have antibodies against squalene . <PARA> it is now known that squalene was not added to the vaccines administered to these veterans , and technical deficiencies in the report suggesting an association have been published . most adults , whether or not they have received vaccines containing squalene , have antibodies against squalene . <PARA> in any case , the squalene issue is a moot point , because the flu vaccines being distributed in the u . s . do not contain squalene . there are currently no vaccines approved for use in the u . s . with a squalene adjuvant , and neither the current swine flu nor the seasonal flu vaccines has any adjuvant at all . a complete list of vaccines ( and their component ingredients ) licensed for immunization and distribution in the u . s . is available on the web site of the food and drug administration ( fda ), and it shows that none of the approved flu vaccines contain squalene .",

( aluminum foil is typically coated with a layer of wax , so it can take up to ten minutes or so for the fluid to strip away the wax and react with the aluminum foil , enhancing the chances that a soon - to - explode bottle bomb may be picked up by an unwary passer - by .) additionally , the caustic cleaning agents used in bottle bombs can cause severe burns when they come into contact with skin ( either through spillage in the construction of the bombs or through being sprayed widely in the resulting explosions ) and produce toxic fumes . <PARA> the above - <MASK> e - mail warning about neighborhood residents discovering undetonated bottle bombs in their yards was sent out by washtenaw county sheriff \u2019 s deputy keith mansell in april 2010 after he discovered two drano bombs left in the yards of residents of york township , michigan . for the most part , those who concoct bottle bombs mix the ingredients , immediately set their work aside , and stand back to watch it explode within a minute or two . however , there are ways of delaying the mixture and / or reaction of the ingredients so as to cause a delayed detonation , so those who discover objects that appear to be bottle bombs should refrain from handling them and contact authorities for removal . <PARA> at about the same time as deputy mansell \u2019 s warning hit the internet , the town of methuen , massachusetts , experienced a rash of similar plastic - bottle bomb placements , including two that blew apart mailboxes : <PARA> some more cases of bottle bomb discoveries include one such item found on an oregon elementary school playground on 18 february 2013 : <PARA> a woman residing in wichita , kansas , called police on 16 february 2013 after someone detonated bottle bombs nearby : <PARA> also in february 2013 , police in beavercreek , ohio , warned residents about a recent rash of drano bottle bomb incidents in the community :",

        "text": "the chemical element potassium ( k ) is vital for the continued healthy functioning of your adrenal glands , which are located on top of your kidneys and composed of two parts , the medulla and the cortex . when properly functioning , the adrenal glands pump hormones out to your body in response to stress in your environment and also regulate the vital functions associated with these stress responses , such as switching on sweat glands to regulate body temperature , converting food into needed energy , regulating blood pressure , and triggering anti - inflammatory responses . <PARA> bananas have long been touted as an excellent source of dietary potassium , as that element is naturally present in the yellow fruit . bananas not only supply your body with needed potassium but also provide other beneficial effects , such as lubricating your digestive tract , keeping you regular , and protecting your intestines from ulcers and abrasive acids . <PARA> given all those positives , why would anyone be concerned about overdosing on bananas ? the answer is because there is too much of a good thing : hyperkalemia ( high potassium ) in a medical condition that can result from factors such kidney disease or failure , addison \u2019 s disease , alcoholism , heavy drug use , low red blood cell count ( from a severe injury or burn ), type 1 diabetes , or excessive use of potassium supplements . <PARA> however , is there really enough potassium in bananas that one need worry about the fatal effects of consuming too many of them ? it \u2019 s certainly a persistent belief , as demonstrated by the following video clip in which english travel show presenter karl pilkington repeats to comedian ricky gervais the <MASK> that \u201c if you eat more than six [ bananas ], it can kill you \u201d ( which is why , supposedly , bananas aren \u2019 t sold in bunches containing more than six ): <PARA> working out the math shows there \u2019 s little cause for concern in this regard , though . the amount of potassium one takes in from eating a single banana is about 422 mg , while the recommended daily allowance ( rda ) of potassium for adults is about 4 , 700 mg per day . so the average adult could safely consume 11 bananas per day and still be taking in less potassium than is recommended as a healthy daily amount . <PARA> okay , but what if one is eating all those bananas at once , rather than spreading them out across the course of a day ? according to the linus pauling institute , \u201c oral doses [ of potassium ] greater than 18 grams taken at one time in individuals not accustomed to high intakes may lead to severe hyperkalemia , even in those with normal kidney function .\u201d that amount of potassium is the equivalent of consuming about 42 bananas , in one sitting , a gastronomical feat far beyond the unforced capabilities of most people . <PARA> in fact , adverse effects of excessive consumption of potassium from food alone have never been documented . it is <MASK> that potassium from supplements or salt substitutes can result in hyperkalemia and possibly sudden death if excessively consumed by individuals with chronic renal insufficiency , but that \u2019 s not because potassium supplements are inherently dangerous . rather , about 90 % of potassium is excreted by the kidneys , so persons suffering from kidney disease ( or other renal complications ) have trouble excreting the excess potassium from potassium supplements to the point that it could reach dangerous levels if taken in excess . <PARA> so fear not that you might drop dead from having a few too many bananas . you \u2019 ll likely take in more potassium from eating foods such as avocados and yogurt than from bananas .",

        "text": "<MASK> : this e - mailed alert began circulating on the internet in march 2007 . while we don \u2019 t yet know the specific product referenced in the letter ( the manufacturer wasn \u2019 t named ), there was indeed a <PARA> recall of certain brands of sidewalk chalk in 2003 because they were found to contain excessive amounts of lead . <PARA> in 2003 , voluntary recalls were issued by both target and toys r us for the \u201c double dipp \u2019 n fun \u201d brand of sidewalk chalk then being vended by both retailers . produced in china , the triangular chalk sticks were multicolored and sold for about 99 cents per package . some 26 , 000 units were sold nationwide between march and july 2003 . <PARA> given that there does not appear to be a current consumer products and safety commission alert about sidewalk chalk , there is reason to believe the march 2007 e - mail about lead being found in that type of product refers to the 2003 incident . indeed , the letter \u2019 s \u201c both of my children tested positive for lead exposure a few years ago . we had everything tested and it turned out to be sidewalk chalk \u201d tends to indicate the product in question was the \u201c double dipp \u2019 n fun \u201d brand that was subsequently recalled . <PARA> as to why this matter is of note , while exposure to lead presents a hazard to all , it poses an especial danger to children . additional care must be taken to limit their exposure to it . <PARA> lead poisoning can reportedly lower intelligence , cause mental retardation , memory problems , depression , fatigue , hyperactivity , aggression , hearing loss , liver or kidney damage , osteoporosis , high blood pressure and anemia . very high levels can damage the nervous system , kidneys and major organs and even result in seizures or death . it can also lead to infertility in men and cause spontaneous abortion in women . in the final stages of lead poisoning , the victim experiences convulsions , paralysis , blindness , delusions , and then coma . people can and have died of lead <PARA> poisoning . <PARA> in times long past , lead was to be found in numerous everyday items , including cisterns and aquaducts , pottery , pans , hair dyes , cosmetics , and medical nostrums . toy soldiers were cast in it . port wine was protected by it . church roofs were covered with it . the presence of lead in everyday life has since been considerably reduced and our bodies are far less riddled with this deadly substance than were those of our ancestors , but this element will likely always be part of our surroundings and of us . <PARA> the two major sources of lead poisoning in the united <MASK> have been lead - based paint , which was restricted in 1978 , and leaded gasoline , which was phased out in the early 1990s . however , lead is still found in paint manufactured before 1978 , in soil and dust ( particularly next to busy roads or factories ), in some imported or handmade pottery and tableware , and in imported home remedies and cosmetics . <PARA> yet most of the lead we take in comes from our diet . \u201c the average daily diet probably contains more than 200 micrograms of lead , of which about 10 micrograms gets into the blood , where it is joined by about 5 micrograms of lead from our lungs ( depending upon where we live ), so that our daily intake probably comes to about 15 micrograms and the body can easily rid itself of such an amount ,\u201d says john emsley . lead finds its way into the food chain because all plants contain some lead , although not very much . <PARA> because lead is a naturally - occurring element found in the soil , it does manage to get into things . care therefore has to be taken by manufacturers to detect its presence in goods destined for consumer use . various lead - laden gewgaws and foodstuffs do arrive on the market , however , especially among goods produced in other parts of the world and imported to the u . s . in 2004 , california \u2019 s attorney general sued dozens of companies that make or sell imported candies containing lead , and in 2005 the california department of health services urged consumers to stay away from candy produced in mexico that contained tamarind or chili powder after tests found possible lead contamination in those edibles . in 1994 an outbreak of lead poisoning in hungary was traced to the use of that element by an unscrupulous or unknowing manufacturer as a colorant in paprika . <PARA> barbara \u201c get the lead out \u201d mikkelson",

( provided that player does not make any mistakes , he is still at a 1 % disadvantage . over time , this small negative percentage will grind him to dust .) <PARA> to buy the shoeless joe <MASK> you have to first believe an incredible run of luck could last a week and more . second , you have to believe this run of luck would visit someone who , as a matter of course , split tens and doubled down on hard twelves and thirteens ( both of which are almost shooting offenses in the <MASK> of nevada ). though on any given day any casino can be beat by anyone ( no matter how well or how badly that person plays ), time is the enemy . over time the law of averages catches up with the aberration ; the peaks and valleys of wild results get smoothed out as the numbers once again fall into the standard distribution pattern . <PARA> i \u2019 m far more inclined to think this a publicity stunt with a suitably obnoxious old coot hired to play the part of shoeless joe ( and thus fool a lot of people \u2014 including casino employees \u2014 into thinking they were seeing this miracle happen ) than i am to allow for this being a <MASK> <MASK> . even so , it \u2019 s up to you to decide . <PARA> the <MASK> as compiled from some 1995 newspapers : <PARA> nobody knows where he came from . nobody knows were he has gone . but for a week at the beginning of april the man they called \u201c shoeless joe \u201d was the talk of this town of broken dreams , his astonishing run of luck the buzz of the blackjack tables . <PARA> on april 2 , an 80 - year - old man with a metal walking stick described by everyone who met him as hunched , bald , ugly , smelly , with broken glasses , a long pointed chin and terrible teeth shuffled shoeless past the normally watchful security guards at the faux buccaneer portals of treasure island , one of las vegas \u2019 s most expensive new casinos . <PARA> in his pocket he had a $ 400 government social security cheque , which he cashed at the casino \u2019 s bank . then he began playing the $ 5 blackjack tables , trying to beat the house to 21 . within a week , in a run of luck few in vegas can recall ever having heard the likes <MORE> just like the other gambling enthusiasts , whose losses have built this improbable town in the middle of the desert and the immense fortunes of people such as wynn who own it , shoeless joe won all that money only to lose it all again . <PARA> of course he was helped immeasurably by the gracious attention casino management pays to big winners . as the old man \u2019 s winnings began climbing towards the million mark , the casino began \u201c comping \u201d him lavishly , providing more than the complimentary drinks on offer to all the other patrons at their tables . <PARA> he got a suite of rooms , a limousine longer than three roulette tables to take him on shopping binges , and round - the - clock bodyguards who tended to his every need . although they might not have been instructed specifically to make sure he did not try to gamble away the money he had won at treasure island at another casino , they were no doubt gratified that he did not . <PARA> \u201c yeah he \u2019 s broke , completely broke ,\u201d said another treasure island blackjack dealer last week . \u201c they got it all back . every cent .\u201d <PARA> maybe it was the dealers who got their revenge . despite all the incredibly lucky cards they dealt him , shoeless joe did not tip a dealer once . <PARA> what has happened to shoeless joe ? some said they thought he was homeless and back on the streets ; others that he lived in subsidised government housing . there were unconfirmed reports of him hanging around the cheap casinos and topless joints of the seedy glitter gulch area of old downtown las vegas , far from the glamorous palaces such as treasure island and the mirage . <PARA> the management of treasure island is more than relieved to have seen him off . happy to parade rich winners for the press to help publicise their casino , they steadfastly refused to talk about shoeless joe . alan feldman , head of public relations for treasure island , voiced distaste at the idea of anyone cashing a social security cheque at the casino . <PARA> \u201c that money was supposed to be used for housing and food ,\u201d he said , \u201c and if you think using that to gamble is what las vegas is all about then you are grossly mistaken .\u201d <PARA> shoeless joe , whoever he is , wherever he is , has faded back into the poverty and anonymity from which he came . and the dream he briefly embodied , that anyone , given a few decent cards , might tranform themselves into a millionaire , has disappeared with him . <PARA> barbara \u201c unless they \u2019 re business cards \u201d mikkelson <PARA> sightings : this <MASK> was adapted for the premiere episode of nbc \u2019 s las vegas television series in 2003 .",

        "text": "the word \u201c balls \u201d has long been used as the basis for double entendre jokes . because it is widely recognized as a slang term for a portion of the male genitalia ( the testicles ) but also has some very common and innocuous meanings ( e . g ., spherical objects used in sports and games ; formal social dance gatherings ), risqu\u00e9 puns that play on the word can be slipped into contexts where jokes featuring more direct sexual references would be considered inappropriate and unacceptable . ( a well - traveled joke - cum - urban legend involving a traffic cop keys on the dual meaning of \u201c balls ,\u201d for example .) <PARA> broadcast <MASK> includes a number of legends involving broadcasters who supposedly sneaked onto the air bawdy puns utilizing the duality of the phrase \u201c kissing balls .\u201d one of the more well - known examples was commonly attributed to comic bob hope during his days as a radio personality : <PARA> a similar legend has been attributed to a variety of baseball play - by - play announcers , most notably former cardinals pitcher dizzy dean : <PARA> the version of this gag with a punchline about \u201c kissing balls for luck \u201d has been associated with a number of professional golf and tennis stars ( e . g ., jack nicklaus , rod laver ) and put in the mouths of the athletes themselves , their wives , or hapless sports announcers . the most pervasive form of this legend has either golfer arnold palmer or his wife innocently blurting out the punchline to johnny carson during a tonight show appearance in the mid - 1960s , prompting a ribald response from the talk show host : <PARA> certainly arnold palmer \u2019 s wife never <MASK> on the tonight show that she kissed her husband \u2019 s balls for luck : the wife of a pro golfer , not herself a celebrity , simply wasn \u2019 t the type of guest johnny carson invited to appear on his highly - rated talk show . ( indeed , arnold palmer \u2019 s representative confirmed to us that mrs . palmer was never a guest on that program .) as for arnold palmer himself , comedian jay leno asked him about the legend in 1994 , a few years after taking over as permanent host of the tonight show following carson \u2019 s retirement in 1992 , and palmer indicated to him that the <MASK> was based on nothing more than a joke deliberately told by carson : <PARA> anecdotal <MASK> indicates this specific form of the legend was around well before johnny carson took over the tonight show desk in 1962 , as author ben alba attributes it to an incident featuring the wife of golfer sam snead and occurring during steve allen \u2019 s tenure as the <MASK> tonight show host in the mid - 1950s : <PARA> this version is a little more plausible in that it doesn \u2019 t require the non - celebrity wife to be herself a guest on a talk show , merely a coincidental audience member . however , an excerpt from a july 1954 newspaper column by journalist walter winchell suggests the \u201c kiss his balls \u201d joke was a known broadcast gag even before steve allen \u2019 s debut as a network tv talk show host : <PARA> presumably the \u201c j . tillman \u201d mentioned here was john tillman , then a newscaster and \u201c man of all trades \u201d affiliated with wpix , consolidated edison \u2019 s television <MASK> in new york , but it isn \u2019 t possible to discern from this brief snippet whether winchell himself actually witnessed the interview he described ( or was merely told about it by someone else ), whether it was actually aired on television ( or was filmed but edited out before broadcast ), or whether it even took place at all . ( plenty of reporters over the years published apocryphal broadcast stories that were relayed to them by someone else as genuine news items .) <PARA> since nearly all the kinescopes , videotapes , and films of the tonight show ( both the steve allen and johnny carson versions ) made prior to 1972 were subsequently destroyed , and much of what was broadcast live on television in the 1950s was either never recorded or similarly destroyed afterwards , whether this humorous faux pas ever played out in real life is unlikely to be definitively proved or disproved . but , as with many tales of this nature , the yarn was likely once just a colorful joke until someone once decided to spice it up by presenting it as a <MASK> <MASK> . for maximum effect and embarrassment , the set - up of the gag requires that the inadvertently - uttered punchline be witnessed by an audience , so setting the anecdote within the framework of a television interview nicely fit the bill .",

( since purchased by transunion ) to produce a wireless 411 service . their goal was to pool their listings to create a comprehensive directory of cell phone customer names and phone numbers that would be made available to directory assistance providers . <PARA> someone made the wild leap of reasoning that the proposed creation of a cell phone directory was the equivalent of \u201c giving cell phone numbers to telemarketers \u201d and began the chain of wildly inaccurate e - mails warning cell phone users to register with the national do not call list in order to prevent this fate . this warning was overblown , for a couple of major reasons : <PARA> all of these points have been summed up in numerous media <MASK> , such as the following from the milwaukee journal sentinel : <PARA> cellular users can choose to register their cell numbers with the national do not call registry as an additional measure of protection , although fcc regulations already in place outlaw most types of telemarketing calls to cell phones . ( the can spam act of 2003 prohibits unsolicited commercial messages to wireless phones , and the telephone consumer protection act of 1991 prohibits any calls to cell phones that employ auto - dialers or any artificial or prerecorded voice messages .) <PARA> there is not ( and never has been ) a deadline to list one \u2019 s phone number with the national do not call registry \u2014 it can be done at any time . ( contrary to previous <MASK> , the ftc announced in october 2007 that do not call registry entries will not expire after five years , so those who signed up when the registry went into effect in june 2003 will not have to register again in 2008 .) <PARA> unfortunately , customers have little recourse against telemarketers who willfully ignore the do not call registry and violate other restrictions against placing calls to cell phones . violators can be reported to the fcc , but that organization has limited resources to investigate and take action regarding the thousands of cases reported to them daily . <PARA> in march 2013 , the ftc published \u201c the truth about cell phones and the national do not call registry ,\u201d in response to recirculating <MASK> about the national do not call database , cell phones , and telemarketers :",

        "text": "<MASK> : a common facet of collegiate life are conjectures that position one \u2019 s school as in some way distinct from or better than all others , conjectures that come to be believed by the young people who <PARA> attend those institutions . such tales bestow ( at least in the minds of the students ) certain bragging rights and thus tend to be embraced as fact rather than questioned . <PARA> \u201c my school is special because ...\u201d <MASK> tend to concentrate on physical aspects of the campus ( e . g ., that certain buildings were through an architect \u2019 s blunder built backwards or that particular items of <MASK> will do strange things when a virgin walks by , or that a dorm is haunted by the ghost of a co - ed who killed herself or was murdered there ) or posturings about the proclivities of the student body ( e . g ., that the particular college being boasted about was at one time named playboy \u2019 s top party school ). <PARA> the particular collegiate belief that forms the topic of this <MASK> is a bit of an exception to the norm because it advances the <MASK> that the institutions of higher learning in question are special not because of something physically or historically part of any one of them , but through their having been ennobled in a popular cartoon that has become a cult favorite among collegians . according to cherished belief , each of the main characters in scooby - doo represents one of the schools known collectively as the five colleges : amherst , hampshire , mount holyoke , smith , and university of massachusetts amherst ( also known as umass ). the explanation for this phenomenon is generally attributed to the show \u2019 s creator being an alumnus of one of those schools , usually umass . <PARA> with almost no variation , the cartoon characters and colleges are matched up this way : <PARA> whose students are represented in this tableau as polished , upper - class young ladies more interested in acquiring rich husbands than university sheepskins . <PARA> whether the above stereotypes fit the studential norm of these schools is a subjective issue . what is objectively answerable , however , is how the scooby - doo series came about , an evolution of a concept that puts paid to the notion that the five familiar characters are representations of what somebody regarded as the typical student attending each of the five colleges . <PARA> in response to criticism that saturday morning children \u2019 s offerings contained too much violence , a number of new cartoons were developed in the late 1960s , including the archie show . the <MASK> concept of what was to become scooby - doo , where are you ? was of a five - teen musical group touring the countryside and becoming embroiled in mysteries wherever they stopped , a <MORE> soon fell by the wayside , giving way to a new series title : who \u2019 s scared ? the five teens had become four : geoff and mike were melded into the composite character ronnie ( later rechristened freddie jones as an homage to fred silverman , then director of daytime programs at cbs - tv ), kelly was renamed daphne blake , linda was redubbed velma dinkley , and w . w . was given the new name of norville \u201c shaggy \u201d rogers . the former linda and w . w . ( now velma and shaggy ) were no longer sister and brother . <PARA> that iteration was judged by network executives as too scary for its intended audience of youngsters , so the show \u2019 s concept was consequently retooled : the rock band idea was dropped , and the focus of the show shifted to highlight comic interactions between the characters and to play down its more frightening aspects . in particular , the characters of shaggy and too much were brought into the forefront to reposition the show as a comedy . the dog was rechristened scooby - doo by fred silverman , who came up with the name upon listening to the vocal improvisation at the end of frank sinatra \u2019 s strangers in the night : \u201c scooby dooby doo ...\u201d <PARA> scooby - doo , where are you ? premiered on cbs in 1969 . the series aired in various forms first on cbs and then on abc until 1991 , making it the longest continually running cartoon series in television <MASK> . the <MASK> cast had record - spinner casey kasem voicing the character of shaggy . ( don messick was scooby - doo , frank welker was fred , nicole jaffe was velma , and stefanianna christopherson was daphne .) <PARA> if all of the above seems a bit hard to wade through , i offer what it boils down to : the scooby - doo gang were not conceived as representations of typical students of particular colleges \u2014 instead , its four human members were <MASK> modeled on corresponding characters from the 1960s tv show the many loves of dobie gillis , and the canine character was elevated from a non - speaking bongo - playing pet into the star of the show when the focus of the cartoon shifted to place greater emphasis on comedy . the five characters now so well known did not spring into being fully formed ; they instead evolved throughout the behind - the - scenes development process . <PARA> alternatively , consider this : hampshire college did not open until 1970 , a year after scooby - doo , where are you ? hit the airwaves . <PARA> obligatory strange scooby fact : the gang is 84 % more likely to stumble upon a secret passage than to find it intentionally . <PARA> barbara \u201c passage err pigeons \u201d mikkelson",

        "text": "<MASK> : the classic \u201c halloween campus murders \u201d fright tale is a legend almost plague - like in its cyclicity , one that periodically resurfaces , spreads widely , and sends many students rushing home or barricading themselves inside their rooms during the weekend of ( or just before ) halloween . ( that each major outbreak of the <MASK> seems to occur several years after the previous iteration suggests that the legend takes hold anew once most of the students who <PARA> experienced the previous occurrence have graduated and moved on , making room for a new crop of youngsters who have never been exposed to it before .) <PARA> this <MASK> \u2019 s first known appearance was in the midwest in 1968 , perhaps inspired by richard speck \u2019 s murderous attack on nine nurses in a chicago rooming house a few years earlier . it has seen numerous outbreaks since then , most notably in 1979 ( midwest ), 1983 ( nationwide ), 1986 ( central pennsylvania ), and 1991 ( new england ), and it made a huge comeback in 1998 ( perhaps inspired by the release of the movie urban legend earlier that year ) when it spread across college campuses throughout the midwest . <PARA> the basic outline of the <MASK> is that a psychic has predicted a crazed killer will strike on a college campus on or near halloween , with the psychic providing only vague clues about which campus will be targeted \u2014 clues that are ambiguous enough to allow them to be applied to nearly every college campus in the country . nearly all the details of the legend \u2014 when and where the prediction was made , who the killer will be , what weapon the murderer will wield , which campus he will strike , what building the slayings will occur in , and how many students will be killed \u2014 vary according to where and when the legend is repeated . <PARA> some of the more common variations include the following : <PARA> the details included in the versions circulated during the 1998 outbreak of this <MASK> were : <PARA> <!\u2013 <PARA> in 1998 , this <MASK> was reported as being spread at the following schools : <PARA> even though this legend has been circulating for decades ( with nary a student falling victim to an axe - wielding bo peep in the meanwhile ), many students in 1998 were still being advised to not go anywhere alone and to watch out for \u201c suspicious \u201d individuals . although these are always wise precautions , one would hope the need to vacate dormitories in response to a legend has become unnecessary . the abundance of student newspaper <MASK> collected below indicates that perhaps saner heads forestall further outbreaks of the legend . <PARA> as to how this legend got started in the first place , folklorist simon bronner noted in his collection of campus lore that \u201c the coincidence of the <MASK> with the darkening fall season , the mistrust of the security of institutional life \u2014 especially for students away from the haven of home \u2014 and the setting of many campuses in isolated arcadias undoubtedly feeds the <MASK> .\u201d he suggested that as colleges eased the restrictions of dormitory life and took a much less active role in their students \u2019 personal lives , students came to see campuses as \u201c more open but less protected \u201d places , sites \u201c potentially open to dangerous strangers .\u201d <PARA> update : this legend resurfaced in 2007 at kent <MASK> university ( ksu ) in ohio . we have not heard of outbreaks of the <MASK> at other u . s . schools that year .",

the largest school district in virginia does not call out such religious holidays by name . in montgomery , closing schools for jewish holidays began in the 1970s . in voting to scrub the holiday names from the calendar , board members said they were trying to reflect the reason schools are closed on religious holidays : because of operational impacts \u2014 such as expected high absenteeism among students and staff on those days \u2014 not because the school system is observing a religious occasion . <PARA> superintendent joshua p . starr presented the board with three options to resolve the question , and a majority of members supported his recommended proposal to do away with the names of both the muslim and the jewish holidays on the calendar . but amending the proposal , the board opted to ditch references to christmas and easter , too . <PARA> board members pointed to the fairfax county school system \u2019 s calendar as an example ;

        "text": "on 6 november 6 2012 , maker faire africa , a science fair and festival , posted a <MASK> about one of the projects featured in that year \u2019 s festival , a urine - powered generator created by four 14 - and 15 - year - old students : <PARA> that page described , in broad terms , how the device worked : <PARA> the conclusion drawn by a number of the online images hailing this invention as the solution to earth \u2019 s global warming and energy problems is that the urine alone is generating the electricity . but this is not the case , as additional energy in needed to separate the hydrogen from the oxygen in the urine so that the former can be used as a fuel source ( one of the major reasons why water fuel cells are not powering our cars right now ). <PARA> the way around this problem , for the purpose of the science fair project , was to put the urine ( or , more accurately , the h2o in the urine ) through an electrolysis cell . duro - aina adebola , the 14 - year - old who came up with the project , explained how the group used an old car battery for this step , in a documentary produced by the youth - oriented african television program tvc in the streets : <PARA> while it is not clear whether the chemicals remaining in the car battery or the bacteria feeding off the urine are used to generate a current ( both explanations have been positied in media reports ), scientists agree that the device does not produce a net gain in energy . gerardine botte , a professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering at ohio university , told forbes that : <PARA> that does not mean that the girls \u2019 device is just a form of parlor trick , however \u2014 in fact , the real significance and motivation behind the project may have been lost by those trying to sell it as an advance in sustainable energy . in the tvc in the streets documentary , duro - aina explained that her main motivation for the project was hearing about an increase in carbon monoxide deaths from fossil - fuel powered generators put into use due to a failing nigerian energy grid and wanting to \u201c make a generator that won \u2019 t release carbon monoxide .\u201d <PARA> in that respect , the girls \u2019 invention was an unqualified success . using secondhand or other easy - to - find parts , these high school students were able to build a device that separated hydrogen gas from urine , to create a system to purify and store that gas , and to convert a traditional generator into one that worked with that hydrogen gas . <PARA> this device might not be the solution to our future energy needs , but such a system could be a way to remove waste while recovering some of the energy involved in that process and thereby fuel homes without filling them with the poisonous gases that gas - powered generators typically produce . this is a point that gerardine botte also made , saying that \u201c when put in the context of wastewater treatment , the concept of using urine as a hydrogen source to produce energy has great potential .\u201d <PARA> as far as high - school science fair projects go , this is as impressive as it gets . but , unfortunately , no such science project can rewrite the laws of thermodynamics .",

        "text": "although whispers about young women trying to furtively get their alcohol buzzes on by inserting vodka - soaked tampons into themselves have existed for more than fifteen years ( our oldest printed reference dates to 1999 , but the <MASK> is likely a fair bit older than that ), cases documenting instances of women actually engaging in such a practice are rare to non - existent and well short of proving it to be the widespread phenomenon <MASK> makes it out to be . nonetheless , as with so many other stories about supposedly worrisome teen crazes , news outlets periodically run stories <MASK> insertion of \u201c vodka tampons \u201d to be a real and common activity , stories based on little or nothing more than mere repetition of <MASK> ( e . g ., \u201c we \u2019 ve heard teens are doing this \u201d). <PARA> arguing strongly against such <MASK> is the nature of tampons themselves . while these cylindrical compacted wads of cotton and / or rayon do soak up liquid readily ( which is their purpose , after all ), they also become nigh on impossible to insert into any bodily orifice when they are in such a saturated <MASK> . <PARA> also , as blog editor danielle crittenden discovered when she experimented with the procedure , putting vodka into direct contact with vaginal membranes hurts like the dickens , with the pain not retreating after a few moments of discomfort but rather continuing unabated for as long as the liquor is present ( and indeed well after ). <PARA> crittenden \u2019 s research also showed even a \u201c super - plus \u201d tampon could absorb only 1 . 5 ounces of vodka , with a half ounce of that having to be wrung from it prior to insertion . the amount of alcohol therefore available to provide a buzz to thrill - seeking teens would be akin to that found in one typical mixed drink , a tipple hardly worth going to the trouble of inserting a vodka - soaked tampon into one \u2019 s nether regions even if the procedure were pain - free and could be showed to work . <PARA> as to why anyone would want to ingest alcohol in this fashion , three reasons are given for the purported practice : to do away with the problem of the smell of booze on one \u2019 s breath , to bypass the stomach and thus more quickly benefit from the full effect of the hooch , and to eliminate the sort of gastric distress that leaves a heavy imbiber clutching the porcelain god at 4 a . m . <PARA> the most commonly - given reason , the avoidance of bowery breath , has the least going for it . if one were to ingest vodka vaginally ( or anally , as the <MASK> is also expressed that way ), the practice wouldn \u2019 t result in booze - free breath because alcohol <MORE> behavior often gives the game away long before the stink of booze does . any teen who thinks avoiding parental detection is nothing but a matter of masking or eliminating the scent is probably in for a rude surprise . <PARA> even if putting liquor into direct contact with the mucus membranes of the vagina or rectum worked to speed alcohol into the bloodstream , the practice might come at a cost . such membranes are sensitive , and the potential burning discomfort of flooding those areas with john barleycorn \u2019 s finest could prove memorable and not nearly adequately compensate for having advanced one \u2019 s inebriation by a matter of minutes . <PARA> some <MASK> taking in vodka through the insertion of liquor - soaked tampons might ( and we \u2019 re not going to test this theory , so we \u2019 ll leave it at \u201c might \u201d) work to keep one \u2019 s dinner in place during a fierce night of partying , citing the notion it avoids the presence of large amounts of alcohol into the stomach , a presence that works to irritate the lining of that organ and thus prompt regurgitation of its contents . ( however , vomiting is one of the body \u2019 s defense mechanisms against poisoning , so suppressing or avoiding that function is not generally a good idea . in 2005 , for example , a woman was charged with negligent homicide for administering a sherry enema that caused the death of her husband from alcohol poisoning .) another putative reason given for imbibing in this manner is bypassing the stomach avoids the calories associated with alcohol consumption . <PARA> the <MASK> has become particularly attached to the scottish rock band mogwai . according to lore , while trapped in a european tour environment where hooch was hard to come by , the band members soaked tampons in vodka and inserted them into their rectal cavities in order to facilitate the swift and efficient entry of the small available stock of alcohol into their bloodstreams . the group maintains they never did this , and the belief they did arose from an innocent conversation with a journalist in which mere discussion of the practice was subsequently misremembered by that reporter as the group \u2019 s having <MASK> to have participated in the activity themselves . <PARA> sightings : vodka - soaked tampons were referenced in an episode of the television crime drama csi (\u201c two and a half deaths ,\u201d <MASK> air date 8 may 2008 ). also , in the tv series the girlfriends \u2019 guide to divorce (\u201c rule no . 67 : don \u2019 t kill the princess ,\u201d <MASK> air date 13 january 2015 ), lilly \u2019 s14th birthday party is enlivened by the sudden cascade of her friends into the pool after vodka - soaked tampons have caused severe sensations of burning and stinging in the nether regions of the young partygoers .",

        "text": "<MASK> : the crew of alaska airlines flight 261 wrestled with a jammed stabilizer for 11 or 12 minutes , trying to maintain altitude and guide their plane to an emergency landing , before the airliner finally plunged into the pacific ocean near port hueneme on 31 january 2000 . during that period , the flight attendants would have ensured that every passenger was in his seat with his belt fastened , prepared for an emergency landing . it didn \u2019 t take long before the tale of on - board pastors offering a final prayer over the plane \u2019 s intercom system during those final minutes began to circulate on the internet . this literal truthfulness of this is not supported by any known <MASK> , <PARA> however . <PARA> according to the national transportation safety board , all that can be heard on the cockpit voice recorder tape is the pilots discussing stabilizer problems with air traffic control and alaska air maintenance personnel , a loud noise around the time the plane lost stabilizer control ( and the voice of a flight attendant notifying the crew of the sound ), and a second loud bang a minute before the plane plunged into the ocean . no passenger - led prayer appears on the tape . <PARA> as well , the <MASK> \u201c there is no good explanation for how the plane was able to stay in the air for those final 9 minutes \u201d is just silly . the pilots regained control of the plane after it suddenly dropped 23 , 700 feet in ninety seconds and were still attempting to troubleshoot the problem when the plane dropped into the ocean about 12 minutes later . the cause of that final plunge was failure of the stabilizer jackscrew threads caused by inadequate lubrication and maintenance / inspection , according to the ntsb \u2018 s report on the crash , thus rather than there being \u201c no good explanation \u201d for how the plane was able to stay up until then ; a more accurate <MASK> would be to say that \u201c there is no good explanation why the plane suddenly dived into the sea 9 minutes later .\u201d in fact , as late as four minutes before the fatal dive , the pilots were requesting clearance to make an emergency landing at los angeles international airport . <PARA> this tale appears to be based on a distortion ( deliberate or otherwise ) of something said by jeff knight of monroe , washington , whose parents , joe and linda knight , were co - pastors of the rock church and were aboard flight 261 when it crashed . a few months after the tragedy , jeff told an associated press reporter that his mother would have been \u201c standing in the aisle of the struggling jet , preaching and helping frightened people find god ,\u201d while his father would have \u201c been writing a note \u201d to his two children ( jeff and 16 - year - old sister jenny ) and his daughter - in - law ( jeff \u2019 s wife ). \u201c that \u2019 s the way they were ,\u201d he said . \u201c i know them so well . a lot of people met jesus that day through my mom .\u201d maybe that \u2019 s what jeff would like to believe his parents did , but his conviction is purely one of faith . <PARA> if a private company tried to turn the flight 261 disaster into a commercial for their product , an outraged public would probably hound them out of business . why should we be any less offended when someone fabricates the details of a tragedy in order to turn it into a commercial for jesus ?",

tell him to strike section 735 from the 2013 continuing resolution . add your voice to the groundswell in response to this dangerous bill ! <PARA> together we will be setting right this gross imbalance ! <PARA> <MASK> : on 26 march 2013 , president obama signed into law a bill passed by the house and senate earlier that month known as the \u201c consolidated and further continuing appropriations act , 2013 \u201d to provide funding for various federal agencies through the end of the 2013 fiscal year . one of the provisions included in that bill in the section for \u201c agriculture , rural development , food and drug administration ( fda ) and related agencies \u201d was section 735 , variously dubbed the \u201c farmer assurance provision \u201d or the \u201c\u2018 monsanto protection act ,\u201d an inclusion which reignited a clash between the agribusiness industry and food safety groups . the former maintains that the farmer assurance provision prevents activists from manipulating the court system to force farmers to abandon or destroy genetically modified ( gmo ) or genetically engineered ( ge ) crops that have already received u . s . department of agriculture ( usda ) safety approval ;

        "text": "in the summer of 2018 , president donald trump \u2019 s \u201c zero tolerance \u201d immigration policy was met with widespread criticism , prompting the trump administration to scale back elements of the plan ( which saw thousands of children separated from their parents at the southwestern border ) after less than three months . <PARA> however , the opposition to that policy prompted allegations of hypocrisy leveled by supporters of president trump against his predecessor , barack obama . some of those comparisons were inaccurate and misleading , as we have examined here previously . <PARA> commentators and social media users brought up an old <MASK> made by barack obama back when he was a u . s . senator representing illinois , in which he expressed opposition to \u201c undetected , undocumented , unchecked \u201d immigration . the highlighting of that <MASK> was intended to create an equivalence between the views expressed by barack obama in 2005 and the \u201c zero tolerance \u201d policy enacted by his successor in the white house in 2018 , and ( either explicitly or implicitly ) level the charge of partisan opportunism and hypocrisy against liberal opponents of trump \u2019 s policies . <PARA> on 23 june , fox news contributor gary kaltbaum appeared on cavuto live and read out the <MASK> in question : <PARA> on 18 june 2018 , the <MASK> was posted on the popular pro - trump reddit forum / the_donald , and on 23 july , val digiorgio ( chairman of the chester county , pennsylvania republican party ) posted a meme showing a photograph of obama along with the same <MASK> that kaltbaum read out on fox news : <PARA> obama did indeed speak these words in 2005 , and also said something very similar in 2006 , although his expressed opposition to unchecked illegal immigration in 2005 was not the same as support for the \u201c zero tolerance \u201d immigration policy implemented by the trump administration in 2018 . <PARA> on 15 december 2005 , barack obama joined republican senator mel martinez of florida in a press conference about bipartisan efforts to bring about immigration reform , during which the former <MASK> : <PARA> obama then laid out the three basic principles of his preferred approach to immigration reform : enhanced border security and enforcement , a guest worker program and electronic verification capabilities for employers , and an \u201c interim legal <MASK> \u201d for the millions of undocumented immigrants living in the united <MASK> whereby those who entered the country illegally would pay a \u201c hefty fine \u201d and \u201c go to the back of the line \u201d before applying for u . s . citizenship . <PARA> the future president repeatedly criticized any approach to immigration reform that focused only on enforcement measures . immediately after uttering the words that would be recirculated in 2018 , senator obama continued on to say : <PARA> on 3 april 2006 , senator obama spoke from <MORE> - pronged approach : better border security and enforcement , a guest worker program with enhanced protections for the rights of immigrant workers and a system for employers to check the legal <MASK> of would - be employees , and a conditional path to citizenship for immigrants who had entered the country illegally . <PARA> ( a full transcript of obama \u2019 s 2006 remarks is available here , on page 24 .) <PARA> \u2018 he sounds like donald trump \u2019 <PARA> in 2005 , obama did say : \u201c we simply cannot allow people to pour into the united <MASK> , undetected , undocumented , unchecked and circumventing the line of people who are waiting patiently , diligently and lawfully to become immigrants in this country .\u201d and he said something very similar a few months later , in 2006 . <PARA> however , in doing so he was merely articulating an orthodox , relatively uncontroversial position among most american politicians : that the u . s . ought not to have open , unmonitored borders , and immigrants who applied for a visa to live and work in the u . s . should be treated preferentially to those who simply crossed the border without legal <MASK> . <PARA> at no time during the 2005 or 2006 speeches in question did obama advocate the equivalent of a \u201c zero tolerance \u201d policy of processing even first - time \u201c improper \u201d border crossings via criminal trials , a prosecutorial shift which has necessitated the mass separation of children from parents at the southwestern border ( a system we have written about in greater detail elsewhere ). <PARA> during his tenure as president , barack obama did oversee the criminal prosecution of some illegal border crossers ( as opposed to the traditional approach of administrative removal ), under a program known as operation streamline begun in 2005 during the administration of president george w . bush . however , this approach was still largely limited to repeat offenders or those with criminal records , and first - time \u201c improper \u201d entrants into the united <MASK> typically continued to be processed administratively before being deported . <PARA> crucially , the \u201c zero tolerance \u201d policy announced by attorney general jeff sessions in april 2018 prescribed the criminal prosecution of all individuals crossing the border unlawfully , even for the first time \u2014 a distinctive characteristic of the trump policy , and the one that brought about the separation of thousands of families at the border , during the spring and summer of 2018 . <PARA> president obama also oversaw an increase in the rate of deportations during his tenure as president , something that brought about the separation of some immigrant families already residing in the united <MASK> . but those families were not typically separated at the border , and this increase in deportations was partly attributable to a change in definitions used in compiling immigration <MASK> .",

        "text": "all manner of sudden fatality are horrendous no matter where or when or how they occur , but we seem to assign decapitations to a special category populated by modes of death we find particularly disturbing . this form of expiration is especially gruesome because the mind is cut off from the body , ending a life , and it all takes place in a flash . a person who moments before was a living , thinking being is now just a headless trunk , spurting blood like a ghoulish prop in a bad horror film . though all forms of demise lead to the same place , this one is sickly fascinating thanks to its elevated gore <MASK> and the speed with which it drives home the finality of death . <PARA> we \u2019 d like to think beheadings happen only in campfire tales and low - budget thrillers , but they take place in real life too , as was the case in the death of dr . hitoshi nikaidoh . on 16 august 2003 , this 35 - year - old surgical resident was decapitated in a freakish elevator accident at christus st . joseph hospital in houston , texas . <PARA> the accident itself is hard to imagine : the ill - fated physician was trapped between the doors of the cable - propelled elevator , then decapitated as the carriage ascended . <PARA> according to the harris county medical examiner \u2019 s office , nikaidoh died from multiple blunt force injuries to the head and body . his corpse was retrieved from the bottom of the elevator shaft along with two pagers , a cell phone , and an electronic organizer police believed belonged to him . the upper portion of his head , which was severed just above the lower jaw , was found in the car of the elevator . his colleague , physician \u2019 s assistant karin steinau , who was in the car at the time , witnessed the whole thing . <PARA> ms . steinau told police the elevator had been out of service for a few days prior to the tragedy , but at the time of the accident the \u201c out of service \u201d sign had been removed . she had rung for the elevator ( with the intent of going to the sixth floor ) and had already stepped into it and pushed the button for her floor when nikaidoh tried to get into the car as the door was closing . as soon as she saw he was trapped by the doors , steinau tried to hit the emergency stop button but was unable to do so before the rising elevator had partially decapitated dr . nikaidoh . the elevator continued upwards , finally stopping between the fourth and fifth floors . steinau was trapped in the car along with nikaidoh \u2019 s cranial remains until she was rescued by firefighters . she was treated in the hospital \u2019 s emergency room for shock . <PARA> the cause of the deadly accident was a mystery . elevator doors should not shut when there is something between them , thanks to sensors mounted in the doors . also , a set of contacts in the door should keep the elevator from moving if the doors are not closed . yet both these things reportedly happened . a <MASK> investigative committee later reported that faulty wiring was to blame : <PARA> although elevator fatalities are not common , they do occur from time to time , and they are not always of the \u201c victim steps into an open elevator shaft \u201d ilk . on 21 july 2003 , 76 - year - old l . a . brown was killed at the kenner regional medical center in kenner , louisiana , when the gurney on which he was being transported to surgery in became trapped against the roof of an elevator when the car suddenly dropped several feet just as the gurney was being pulled out of it . on 7 may 1999 , 56 - year - old mary margaret nowosielski died in similar fashion at the st . joseph mercy hospital in michigan when the car her gurney was being rolled into suddenly went up , dragging her to the fourth floor and back down to the first floor between the car and the shaft wall . <PARA> even the elevator decapitation incident related here is not unique . on 6 january 1995 , a runaway elevator in a bronx office building decapitated 55 - year - old james chenault as he tried to help fellow passengers out of a malfunctioning car . the car had stopped slightly above the second floor and the doors opened . while chenault was holding the doors open with his back and helping a woman whose foot had become trapped , the car lurched suddenly upward , beheading him . the victim \u2019 s body fell to the bottom of the shaft , but the head remained in the car along with the remaining passengers as it shot up to the ninth floor .",

( it is not clear whether emts were summoned to the home , what the reason given for the notification was , or what transpired during the emts \u2019 visit .) according to the couple , they declined advice given by the paramedics suggesting they visit a hospital to follow up after the twins \u2019 arrival , and their refusal to go to the hospital prompted the emts to report them to cps . <PARA> the <MASK> <MASK> that homebirth alone prompted emts to file a report with cps . while the decision to give birth at home is often considered risky , and the birth of twins is generally deemed \u201c high risk \u201d by obstetricians , there is no indication that a woman \u2019 s simply choosing a homebirth is a factor in cps involvement . given that home births are not uncommon , allegations such as those made by the rengos should be rife if delivering a baby at home was by itself considered an automatic red flag for abuse . <PARA> as well , a number of <MASK> made in the upsetting account either conflict withed one another . for example , in one <MASK> , rengo said the children were taken from her because she refused to treat eczema with steroids and opted for natural remedies , but in other portions of the <MASK> , she blamed home birth for the children \u2019 s removal ( despite the number of babies born this way each day without cps involvement ). <PARA> the <MASK> of parents and families involved with child welfare agencies in any <MASK> are difficult to independtly verify because unlike criminal cases , family court proceedings are not public . cps and related agencies cannot confirm or deny <MASK> about their actions because their cases generally involve minors and abuse allegations . however , on 3 december 2014 the bellingham herald provided additional details about the rengo case , including <MORE> taken into protective custody amid the <MASK> \u2019 s concerns over a chaotic home life . <PARA> but commissioner thomas verge told cleave rengo , 23 , and erica carey , 29 , that the children would be removed again if they didn \u2019 t follow his conditions as well as cooperate with child protective services . <PARA> cps has said the case had nothing to do with home - birth . <PARA> assistant attorney general rob olson laid out a case that detailed the family \u2019 s numerous contacts with law enforcement since 2013 - 14 in whatcom county and seven when the couple lived elsewhere in washington <MASK> ; refusal or resistance to providing medical care for the children ; concern about the twins being underweight ; domestic disputes between the couple ; cleave rengo being controlling of carey ; and bruce rengo \u2019 s mental health issues , which had included a two - month hospitalization when he stopped taking his medication for bipolar disorder . <PARA> olson also presented information about cleave rengo \u2019 s arrest in battle ground , when the couple had stayed there and carey was eight months pregnant with levi . the <MASK> charges included domestic violence and resisting arrest , but the domestic violence charge was dropped in a plea agreement , which included the mandate that cleave rengo undergo anger management . but he hadn \u2019 t yet completed the anger management requirement and there was a warrant out for his arrest , which concerned the <MASK> . <PARA> but commissioner thomas verge told cleave rengo , 23 , and erica carey , 29 , that the children would be removed again if they didn \u2019 t follow his conditions as well as cooperate with child protective services . <PARA> cps has said the case had nothing to do with home - birth . <PARA> assistant attorney general rob olson laid out a case that detailed the family \u2019 s numerous contacts with law enforcement since 2013 - 14 in whatcom county and seven when the couple lived elsewhere in washington <MASK> ; refusal or resistance to providing medical care for the children ; concern about the twins being underweight ; domestic disputes between the couple ; cleave rengo being controlling of carey ; and bruce rengo \u2019 s mental health issues , which had included a two - month hospitalization when he stopped taking his medication for bipolar disorder . <PARA> olson also presented information about cleave rengo \u2019 s arrest in battle ground , when the couple had stayed there and carey was eight months pregnant with levi . the <MASK> charges included domestic violence and resisting arrest , but the domestic violence charge was dropped in a plea agreement , which included the mandate that cleave rengo undergo anger management . but he hadn \u2019 t yet completed the anger management requirement and there was a warrant out for his arrest , which concerned the <MASK> .",

        "text": "new jersey sen . cory booker was reticent about the democratic national committee \u2019 s proposal to revoke white house adviserjared kushner \u2019 s security clearance during a 28 may 2017 appearance on cnn \u2019 s <MASK> of the union . <PARA> the proposal came in response to reports that kushner , who is also trump \u2019 s son - in - law , had sought to open an unofficial \u201c back channel \u201d for communications with the russian government . <PARA> booker \u2019 s lack of support for removing kushner \u2019 s security clearance has prompted some commentators to draw a link to kushner \u2019 s past donations to the new jersey senator \u2019 s political campaigns . for example , the day after his appearance on <MASK> of the union , the international business times ( ibt ) printed booker \u2019 s remarks about kushner side by side with details about kushner \u2019 s past donations : <PARA> later that day , the democratize us web site ran with ibt \u2019 s report <MASK> that booker \u201c came to kushner \u2019 s defense \u201d on cnn , and adding that \u201c progressives are livid .\u201d the web site alternet republished ibt \u2019 s <MASK> with the headline \u201c democrat cory booker defends jared kushner \u2014 after receiving loads of campaign cash .\u201d <PARA> first , here is exactly what cory booker said on cnn : <PARA> booker \u2019 s stance on kushner <PARA> host dana bash asked the senator : \u201c are you with the dnc in wanting jared \u2019 s security clearance to be suspended ?\u201d <PARA> at first , booker did not directly answer that question : <PARA> when bash pressed him , booker replied : <PARA> so booker did not overtly oppose the removal of kushner \u2019 s security clearance , but he did not support it either . in essence , he expressed a preference for an investigation , including the questioning of kushner , but left open the possibility that he might subsequently support the removal of his security clearance . <PARA> while these remarks fell short of the dnc \u2019 s explicit call for kushner to be fired and have his security clearance revoked , they were roughly similar to those made by other leading democrats . <PARA> on 28 may 2017 , senator dick durbin declined to comment at all when asked about the allegations surrounding jared kushner , and the question of his keeping his security clearance , on fox news sunday . <PARA> the following day , representative adam schiff \u2014 the ranking democrat on the house intelligence committee \u2014 appeared on abc \u2019 s this week and supported a \u201c review \u201d of kushner \u2019 s clearance , but not its immediate removal , although he did say he would support revoking it if kushner was found to have been untruthful . the day after that , senator al franken appeared on cbs this morning and also stopped <MORE> \u2019 s brother joshua donated $ 5 , 200 and a further $ 10 , 000 in 2014 . <PARA> ivanka trump also contributed $ 10 , 000 to the booker senate victory committee in 2014 . <PARA> in 2009 , jared , seryl , joshua , dara and nicole contributed $ 20 , 000 each to cory booker \u2019 s newark mayor re - election campaign , according to new jersey election law enforcement commission records . <PARA> as for whether the two have a personal relationship : cory booker attended the wedding of jared kushner and ivanka trump in 2009 , according to the new york post . ivanka trump hosted a fundraiser for cory booker in 2013 , according to politico . <PARA> conclusion <PARA> jared kushner has personally donated a total of $ 40 , 400 to cory booker , and members of his immediate family have contributed a further $ 166 , 800 . <PARA> the kushner family and ivanka trump have long records of contributing tens of thousands of dollars to many political candidates , mostly democrats , over the years . their donations to booker were far from unique or unusual , but rather part of a pattern of campaign contributions to new jersey and new york politicians . <PARA> secondly , cory booker famously received $ 7 million in donations for his 2010 newark mayor re - election campaign , and the fec website lists 17 , 758 separate individual donations to his 2013 us senate campaign . <PARA> however , even before donald trump \u2019 s election as president , the kushner family and ivanka trump had a prominence and influence in new york and new jersey business and politics beyond what is reflected in their donations to booker . <PARA> does this mean booker \u2019 s comments on cnn on 28 may were influenced by past donations from the kushner family , and his connections to jared kushner and ivanka trump ? it \u2019 s unclear . the kushners have been prolific donors to many political candidates over the years , and booker has received millions of dollars from thousands of contributors during his political career . <PARA> and finally , what booker actually said on cnn shouldn \u2019 t be exaggerated . he didn \u2019 t \u201c defend \u201d kushner , as some commentators have <MASK> . the senator said kushner should \u201c answer for what was happening at the time \u201d, and called for an investigation , saying the reports of kushner \u2019 s secret communications with russia were \u201c not overblown \u201d and raise \u201c very serious concerns .\u201d <PARA> however , these two separate facts are both accurate : first , cory booker has in the past received campaign donations from jared kushner and his family ; second , while the dnc called for kushner \u2019 s security clearance to be revoked , booker \u2014 like other leading democrats \u2014 declined to go that far .",

upon hearing any of these legends , we mentally cast ourselves in the role of the person it happened to . by making the mythical victim appear both especially at risk and not all that capable of protecting herself , we more clearly express our own fears of the world around us and our personal sense of being vulnerable to attack . <PARA> this legend about wet footprints behind the sofa shares a key theme with some other urban legends , notably the babysitter and the man upstairs , wherein a teenage babysitter eludes a killer hiding upstairs , and the clown <MASK> , wherein another teen babysitter barely escapes a killer masquerading as a clown <MASK> in one of the children \u2019 s rooms . in each of these legends , a teen girl only just avoids being horribly massacred by a stranger lurking in the house . <PARA> barbara \u201c funeral flowers in the attic \u201d mikkelson",

( contestants have given all sorts of stupid , hilarious , and racy answers on the newlywed game over the years , so it wouldn \u2019 t be surprising if bob eubanks failed to realize that this one answer would become the stuff of legend in years to come .) <PARA> tired of being asked constantly about something he didn \u2019 t remember ever happening , eubanks developed a standard \u201c reward \u201d response as a way of trying to get people to stop with the same old question already . ( if he were offering a $ 10 million reward , chances would be pretty good that he was absolutely 100 % sure it never happened ; $ 10 , 000 was an amount large enough to get people \u2019 s attention , but small enough that he could easily pay it off if something did turn up .) <PARA> it is <MASK> that by 1993 eubanks didn \u2019 t even mention \u201c up the butt \u201d when asked to recall the show \u2019 s most outrageous moment : <PARA> \u201c i asked this young lady what was the one thing that her husband told her not to talk about ,\u201d recalled eubanks . \u201c she said that her brother and cousin planned to kill her uncle for his insurance money .\u201d <PARA> the kicker ? <PARA> \u201c her husband came out and matched the answer ,\u201d said eubanks , chuckling at the memory . \u201c they got their 10 points and went on with the game .\u201d <PARA> and the uncle ? <PARA> \u201c i guess he \u2019 s looking up at the sky about now ,\u201d he said . <PARA> as far as we know , bob never did pay up .",

        "text": "a meme <MASK> that every person who has been diagnosed with cancer has a ph that is \u201c too acidic \u201d ( and that cancer cannot live in an alkaline environment ) has been popping up on social media since late 2016 . this specific meme was posted by prolific internet misinformation artist and frequent abuser of the appeal to nature fallacy david \u201c avocado \u201d wolfe , who believes , among other things , that mushroom spores can levitate off the planet : <PARA> ignoring the fact that wolfe never defines what \u201c too acidic \u201d means ( which makes the <MASK> completely meaningless ), it is worthwhile to dive into the scientific <MASK> of <MASK> that link ph to cancer , as it is a far more complicated subject than a single meme whose <MASK> is so broad it almost defies debunking . <PARA> an additional david \u201c avocado \u201d wolfe page goes deeper into the \u201c logic \u201d behind the meme : <PARA> of course , the first problem with the premise proposed by wolfe is that it doesn \u2019 t mention which part of a human body \u2019 s ph is \u201c too acidic \u201d in cancer patients . <PARA> the stomach ( the place where all of that scary food goes ), for example , has wildly varying ph levels that are extremely acidic ( as low as 1 . 5 to 3 . 5 ). blood , on the other hand , exists in a tightly regulated range that stays steady at around 7 . 4 . different parts of different tissues vary as well at both the macro and micro level . <PARA> the only part of the body whose ph a person can affect through diet , however , is the digestive tract and the collection of systems related to excreting urine from your body . your liver tightly regulates the ph of blood and extracellular fluid . therefore , as <MASK> in an october 2013 paper in the british journal of nutrition , unless one has specific pathologies that prevent their body from sustaining this function : <PARA> this is important , as close examination of the ( flawed ) scientific rationale behind a dietary connection to cancer relies on the impossible premise that your diet can alter your blood ph . <PARA> as the additional text of the meme makes clear , the main source of scientific rationale comes from the misrepresentation of work performed by nobel prize laureate otto warburg : <PARA> first , dr . otto warburg , a prolific and truly impressive scientist , did not win his 1931 nobel prize for discoveries relating ph to cancer . according to the nobel prize commission , he won for his contributions to our understanding of the chemistry that makes cellular respiration possible : <PARA> it was warburg \u2019 s interest in cellular respiration that led him toward cancer research , as mentioned in nobel prize biography : <PARA> <MORE> acidity . that means , by his model , that both the acidity and the low oxygen would be a symptom , not a cause . it also bears highlighting that warburg is talking about the ph of blood in veins and arteries here , which , as discussed above , cannot be modified by diet . <PARA> the second problem with wolfe \u2019 s selective use of warburg \u2019 s work is that scientists have actually completed a great deal of research on the topic of cancer since 1956 , and that work makes it even clearer that the causative agent in the formation of cancerous cells is not related to ph , and that both low ph and low oxygen are not a cause but a byproduct ( and potentially a survival mechanism ) of a series of not fully understood processes . <PARA> a march 2016 review in the journal trends in biochemical sciences provided the latest thinking on the role of the warburg effect in the development of cancer , arguing that it was a secondary process early in its progression but not the cause : <PARA> in other words , the initial triggering event for the development of cancerous cells has more to do with genetic damage than it does to do with acidity or oxygen . the warburg effect , many now argue , is a result of that damage and may serve as a mechanism that allows the survival of cancerous cells at the expense of healthy cells . the effect of low oxygen is further exacerbated by the growth of the tumor as its size forces it to migrate away from a close proximity to the veins that supply the cells with oxygen . <PARA> later research on the relationship between ph and cancer has further complicated the myth that an alkaline diet reduces cancer risk . recent studies have suggested , for example , that acidic conditions can lead to a faster and more aggressive progression of tumor development , leading to a wave of research into possible drugs that can alter the acidity of the area in which a tumor is growing . importantly , though , these solutions are targeted pharmacologic agents that have the ability ( unlike a nice glass of alkaline water ) to affect the chemical processes that regulate a body \u2019 s ph . <PARA> with respect to the viability of alkaline diets as a cancer prevention tool , a systematic review of over 8000 citations published in the journal bmj open concluded : <PARA> wolfe \u2019 s use of the warburg effect to suggest that \u201c every single person who has cancer has a ph that is too acidic \u201d is a classic example of circular logic . warburg \u2019 s main contribution to cancer research was the observation that cancer cells actually produce low oxygen and high acid conditions , not that they are caused by such conditions in the first place .",

find out what now before it \u2019 s too late ...\u201d the <MASK> was predicated on a video called \u201c facebook spies on you for the government \u201d which was posted to youtube by the ( equally disreputable ) infowars account on 3 december 2014 and narrated by joe biggs : <PARA> central to biggs \u2019 remarks about facebook \u201c spying \u201d was a specific block of text inside facebook \u2019 s newly revised standard terms and conditions pertaining to the social network \u2019 s use of data culled from the facebook mobile application . the text was displayed during the video several times , with the relevant portions underlined in red : <PARA> facebook \u2019 s ( and other similar social media sites \u2019) relationship to privacy is a multi - faceted , complex , and perpetually evolving issue . the continual introduction of novel apps , scripts , devices , and other innovations and their intersection with law , law enforcement , and constitutional protections <PARA> ensuring privacy and due process is a matter hotly and intricately debated inside courtrooms , in the course of investigations , and in the media . neither that video nor this <MASK> could adequately address the sheer breadth of issues contained within the scope of social media and individual privacy concerns . <PARA> however , biggs ( and those who echoed his <MASK> ) made both vague and specific <MASK> about a particularly imminent issue in terms of facebook and privacy : namely that on 1 january 2015 , facebook would begin colluding with the federal bureau of investigation ( fbi ), central intelligence agency ( cia ), and national security agency ( nsa ) by providing those agencies with an unspecified set of data about social media users . according to the <MASK> , facebook announced this upcoming collusion via publishing \u201c changes \u201d in privacy policies set to go into effect on that date , as <MASK> by biggs \u2019 highlighted text . <PARA> the text in the picture does not , in fact , have any relevance to the disclosure of data to law enforcement sources . in the privacy excerpt shown in that image , the matter at hand is the manner in which data is collected ( via mobile devices or computers ) and an affirmation that data is collected to identify how and where facebook is accessed . while a very suspicious assessment of the wording could theoretically focus on tracking users \u2019 personal lives via geolocation functions , a standard interpretation of this commentary suggests it merely discloses facebook is actively using your location to target ads and accessibility functions based on whether you are out and about , at school , or at work . <PARA> while this text alone does not address the scope of facebook \u2019 s privacy policies , it bears mentioning this relatively benign passage was the most damning one the video \u2019 s creators could locate . if that text is the sole <MASK> of facebook \u2019 s plot to land us all in jail via federal interception of how strong our battery is on a tuesday night , it \u2019 s relatively weak . <PARA> the video also discusses what later posts referred to as a \u201c bombshell \u201d planned by facebook for release on 1 january 2015 . aside from the posts linking back to that 3 december 2014 video , the main reference to facebook changes slated for 1 january 2015 <MASK> with facebook itself . in november 2014 , facebook posted several updates regarding data use and privacy , including a post titled \u201c updating our terms and policies : helping you understand how facebook works and how to control your information .\u201d <PARA> in that post , facebook explained the launch of new privacy controls created in response to complaints its existing settings were too difficult for many users to understand . in addition , the <MASK> detailed how location data and universal logins linked to other services ( such as instagram and whatsapp ) either will be increasingly linked ( or were already connected ) to existing facebook accounts . additionally , facebook briefly addressed the use of data collected regarding user operating systems , battery levels , and signal strength . <PARA> quite simply , while facebook \u2019 s \u201c privacy basics \u201d update slated for january 1 2015 is a bit heavy with jargon and difficult to parse , no part of the announcement could reasonably be interpreted to convey an intent to disclose user data to the cia , fbi , or nsa . even indirectly , no portion of the <MASK> text hinted at cooperation with law enforcement or the use of geolocation or device data in the course of criminal ( or other ) investigations . and even if facebook intended to do such a thing ( which is not supported by any <MASK> , anecdotal or actual ), turning over data obtained in that manner to law enforcement would necessitate the prior issuance of a search warrant .",

( water and other beverages brought on flights must be purchased by passengers from previously - screened vendors after clearing security .) while such devices may be commonly employed by teenagers concealing small quantities of illicit substances from parents or school officials , their limitations for air travel are likely well known by any party seeking to transport banned substances on airplanes . <PARA> contrary to the text accompanying some posted iterations of this video , travelers really need not worry that they should check water they purchase at stores lest the bottle turn out to be loaded up with illegal drugs ( it \u2019 s not practical for would - be smugglers to hand out their contraband to random customers whose identities and destinations are unknown to them ), and the chances of being arrested just for momentarily holding such a bottle are rather slim . it \u2019 s unlikely that the owner of such an item would have reason to ask a random traveler to briefly hold it , or that the compliant recipient would be busted at just that very moment ( unless the perpetrators \u2019 primary purpose were to incriminate the traveler rather than to smuggle contraband ). <PARA> common travel safety and security guidelines already cover vigilance about packing one \u2019 s own luggage and refusing to hold or carry any object or substance ( particularly supplied by a stranger ) while in transit , although hidden drugs aren \u2019 t the only matter with which airport security workers are concerned : explosives and other dangerous weapons are often suspected in cases of unattended or tampered with baggage . <PARA> in short , it \u2019 s best to avoid ever accepting items from strangers at airports so you don \u2019 t find yourself at risk for attempting to carry some type of prohibited item through a security checkpoint , past customs , or onto an airplane . but while it \u2019 s wise to decline taking possession of anything offered by someone you don \u2019 t know while traveling , you are unlikely to endure an unjust arrest simply for briefly holding someone else \u2019 s water bottle .",

( the nea \u2019 s website <MASK> their 2016 funding as $ 147 , 949 , 000 .) chapman also cited an estimate first reported by cnn that providing security for the entire trump family was costing new york city more than $ 1 million a day : <PARA> when asked about that figure on 7 december 2016 , new york mayor bill de blasio called it \u201c premature ,\u201d adding that the city had asked the federal government for $ 35 million in reimbursement for protecting melania trump between 8 november 2016 and her husband \u2019 s inauguration on 20 january 2017 . as the times reported , the request was based on a daily security cost of $ 500 , 000 . the city has reportedly been reimbursed for $ 7 million . <PARA> however , police commissioner james p . o \u2019 neill lowered that estimate in a 21 february 2017 letter to the <MASK> congressional delegation , saying that it cost $ 24 million to protect the first family between the election and the inauguration , or $ 11 million less than de blasio \u2019 s request . the letter also included estimates for security costs for both the first lady and the president : <PARA> based on the figures o \u2019 neill included in his letter , it would cost between $ 46 , 355 , 000 and $ 53 , 290 , 000 a year to provide security for melania and barron trump alone at trump tower , substantially lower than chapman \u2019 s prediction . <PARA> also , if the president were to spend every weekend in new york beginning in march 2017 , it would cost $ 27 , 104 , 000 to provide security during those 88 days , which would also be less than the nea \u2019 s annual budget . however , if president trump \u2019 s proposed budget were accepted as submitted , the nea \u2019 s annual budget would be effectively zero ( unless it secured funding from private sources ).",

        "text": "<MASK> : when dozens of mourners at a funeral in tete , mozambique , passed away after drinking a contaminated batch of phombe in january 2015 , speculation arose that the local homemade beer had been spiked with poisonous crocodile bile : <PARA> the beer , known as \u201c phombe \u201d, is traditionally served at functions in mozambique \u2019 s tete province . deaths from drinking it are rare , correspondents say . <PARA> carle mosse , the province \u2019 s health director , said it was suspected that the poisoning had been caused by crocodile bile although this had yet to be confirmed in tests . <PARA> it was not immediately clear how the beer had been contaminated and whether it was intentional . <PARA> the woman who brewed the beer and several members of her family were among the victims , radio mozambique has reported . <PARA> carle mosse , the province \u2019 s health director , said it was suspected that the poisoning had been caused by crocodile bile although this had yet to be confirmed in tests . <PARA> it was not immediately clear how the beer had been contaminated and whether it was intentional . <PARA> the woman who brewed the beer and several members of her family were among the victims , radio mozambique has reported . <PARA> stories about the supposedly poisonous powers of crocodile bile have been circulating for decades . according to professor n . z . nyazema of the department of clinical pharmacology at the university of zimbabwe , witches in the 1800s were accused of using bile from the gall bladders of crocodiles to make a poison known as nduru . nyazema penned an <MASK> titled \u201c crocodile bile , a poison : myth or reality ?\u201d for central african journal of medicine in 1984 explaining how the poison may have been used : <PARA> it is widely believed that the bile from the gall bladder of a crocodile is very poisonous . the bile nduru is used as poison which is added to beer or stiff porridge , sadza , of an unsuspecting victim . it is not easy to buy this poison neither is it easy for anyone to kill a crocodile solely for the purpose of obtaining the bile . but with a good fee one can obtain some of the poison from a special nanga [ a traditional healer of the zimbabwean shona tribe ]. at times the nanga may undertake to poison the victim thus adding mystery to the ingredients of the poison . it is reported that the poisoning occurs at special occasions like beer drinking : the nduru is said to be introduced into the beer by dipping the finger or nail where a small amount is placed : this will suffice for the purpose . the unfortunate victim is supposed to die within 24 hours . the poison is supposed to manifest itself when the patient develops pains mainly in the abdomen . <PARA> while professor nyazema \u2019 s account mirrors the events that transpired in mozambique in january 2015 ( with the notable exception the above - <MASK> <MASK> references the poisoning of a single person while the events in mozambique would have <PARA> required enough poison for close to one hundred people ), the lethal powers of crocodile bile have yet to be proved . in fact , after learning about nduru , nyazema conducted his own tests to determine the toxicity of crocodile bile : using ten crocodile gall bladders , twenty mice , and a baboon , the professor determined the bile of a crocodile was not particularly lethal . <PARA> hans dieter neuwinger came to a similar conclusion in his book african ethnobotany : poisons and drugs : chemistry , pharmacology , toxicology , writing that crocodile bile was \u201c virtually non - poisonous .\u201d additionally , a study presented at the world crocodile conference in 2013 concluded freeze - dried crocodile bile was safe for human consumption : <PARA> for high efficacy of crocodile bile product , acute effects of freeze - dried crocodile bile were performed on male sprague dawley rats . the result showed that morbidity and mortality have not found any in treatment 300 mg / kg group of rats . because of recommendation dose in human is 25 mg / 60kg / day , there is very less than in the rat treatment . these revealed that freeze dried crocodile bile is appropriate for product development to be supplementary food in the future . <PARA> furthermore , christian lindmeier , a spokesman for the world health organization , said it is not uncommon for locals to add bile to poor quality beer : <PARA> the use of bile is not uncommon in the production of local or poor quality beer but is not known to be toxic to the extent this outbreak shows . <PARA> if crocodile bile really is as harmless as professor nyazema , researcher hans dieter neuwinger , and who spokesman christian lindmeier make it out to be , then where did this fear begin ? forbes science writer david kroll noted on 12 january 2015 while crocodile bile was the main ingredient in the poison nduru , it was likely mixed with other toxic plants : <PARA> traditional descriptions of this poison might be consistent with a toxic plant that may have been added to the brew in witchcraft practices . <PARA> crocodile bile , like bat whiskers , the hair of a black cat , a pinch of gargoyle sweat , eye of newt , and troll teeth , does not appear to be deadly on its own .",

        "text": "<MASK> : on 23 february 2015 , a video titled \u201c the freezing homeless child ! ( social experiment )\u201d was published to youtube by ocktv . the clip rapidly spread on blogs and social networks under clickbaiting titles such as \u201c the homeless child was freezing to death while no one approached him . i never thought this guy would be the only one !\u201d within days , the video had been shared millions of times . <PARA> while the footage tugged at many heartstrings , its creators were somewhat upfront about its staged nature . dubbing the video a \u201c social experiment ,\u201d its publishers admitted that the child was neither legitimately homeless nor freezing in a manner that was anything more than incidental and deliberate . they <MASK> the \u201c social experiment \u201d ( a term often used to excuse a number of unpleasant or deceitful <PARA> behaviors through the premise of illustrating a point ) was designed to prove that the citizens of new york city would not be moved by the child \u2019 s hypothetical plight , even in unusually cold weather . <PARA> several aspects of the <MASK> were shaky , implausible , or simply far too scripted . first , the viral video producers <MASK> that the child was exposed for two full hours in what appeared to be a busy area of midtown manhattan in broad daylight , wearing only a thin t - shirt and shivering violently . however , the new york police department aggressively monitors the streets of the city for at - risk homeless individuals . such measures are stepped up in adverse weather conditions , and the scenario beggars belief when mitigating factors are examined : a minor child , lacking a jacket in extreme cold , left alone on the street in manhattan \u2019 s busiest district . <PARA> a webpage for nyc . gov explains the precautions undertaken by the city in such circumstances : <PARA> the department of homeless services ( dhs ) continues to use its cold weather emergency procedure , called code blue , to protect unsheltered homeless people , who are more at risk for exposure deaths during the cold winter months . during code blue conditions dhs doubles its outreach efforts . community members that identify someone on the street they believe needs assistance should call 311 and ask for the mobile outreach response team ; in any emergency community members should call 911 . the department of homeless services will send an outreach team to the location to assess the individual \u2019 s condition and take appropriate action . <PARA> the second shaky factor was the other content published by orktv prior to their \u201c freezing , homeless child stunt \u201d: all were clearly manufactured for maximum social media interest , and their focus was neither charitable nor honest . ( the words \u201c prank \u201d and \u201c social experiment \u201d appeared frequently in connection with that work .) in the same vein , the video \u2019 s conclusion involved a fellow homeless person stepping up to help where no one else would . ( the man was then purportedly awarded $ 500 for his convenient - to - the - narrative compassion .) <PARA> the third factor was that the video was tied to an indiegogo page purportedly created to raise funds to provide clothing for new york city \u2019 s homeless population . that page was operated by ocktv and lacked any specific detail about how the funds raised would be managed , accounted for , or meaningfully used to assist homeless individuals in new york . and while the campaign could have been on the up - and - up , it was slated to close on 27 march 2015 , well past the brunt of winter \u2019 s unpleasantness in the city . no explanation was given on the page regarding whether the funds collected would be held until the next winter rolled around or repurposed to otherwise assist homeless people at the conclusion of the campaign . <PARA> so while the video depicted a child on the streets of new york city in what looked to be very cold weather , little else about it was honest or straightforward . there are a number of legitimate , vetted charities in new york city dedicated to assisting vulnerable and needy people , and those moved by the video \u2019 s staged events would do better to donate to one of them .",

        "text": "among the most abused sources of data in the anti - vaccine blogosphere ( outside of perhaps , retracted papers ) are records regularly released by the national vaccine injury compensation program ( vicp ), a federal <MASK> court that settles cases of alleged vaccine injury . the court was established in 1986 as part of a compromise between vaccine producers , who did not want to shoulder the litigation risks of vaccine production , and the federal government , who needed a source of vaccines for national immunization programs . the vicp aims to \u201c ensure an adequate supply of vaccines , stabilize vaccine costs , and establish and maintain an accessible and efficient forum for individuals found to be injured by certain vaccines : <PARA> this court frequently settles cases through compensation , but that compensation is rarely issued as part of findings that scientifically or medically tie a vaccine to an alleged injury . \u201c almost 75 percent of all compensation awarded by the vicp comes as result of negotiated settlements between the parties in which hhs has not concluded , based upon review of the <MASK> , that the alleged vaccine ( s ) caused the alleged injury ,\u201d according to the most recent report by the department of health and human services ( hhs ). <PARA> still , anti - vaccine websites regularly and frequently highlight cases from the vicp in which the government has awarded compensation as purported <MASK> that vaccines caused the conditions for which damages were awarded \u2014 often citing only the vaccine - injury lawyers who received a cut of the money awarded by the courts in those cases . a common example of this phenomenon can be found in a post from the conspiracy - minded \u201c health impact news \u201d website that is at least five years out of date but continues to be shared as if it were a breaking news <MASK> : \u201c flu vaccine is the most dangerous vaccine in the u . s . based on settled cases for injuries .\u201d <PARA> that post highlighted raw vicp data from the final quarter of 2013 without performing any mathematical analysis on , or providing any attempt at context for , that data : <PARA> despite the fact that this post uses only three months of data collected several years ago , it continues to be re - shared and reused by clickbait factories . on 11 december 2018 , for example , the website \u201c nwo report \u201d used the same <MASK> described above for their post headlined \u201c dept . of justice admits flu shot is most dangerous vaccine in us \u201d. in fact , the department of justice , who oversee the vicp , never \u201c admitted \u201d such a thing , nor do the data support such a <MASK> . <PARA> in our view , it makes more sense to look at the totality of influenza vaccinations before the vaccine court , not a randomly selected three month period from 2013 . the most recent data , provided by hhs on 30 november 2018 , covers all doses of vaccines administered from 2006 to 2016 , along with the number of <MASK> filed and awarded by vicp . reviewing these data ( which we have organized in this document ), we find that it is <MASK> that the greatest number of cases in which compensation was awarded involved the influenza vaccine . what is not mentioned in anti - vaccine posts is that significantly more flu shots ( 1 . 2 billion doses more than the next most commonly administered vaccine ) were administered during this time period than any other type of vaccine . <PARA> this context demonstrates why raw data are not terribly meaningful for this sort of exercise ( and are of limited use in the first place , since awards of compensation in vicp are based on legal findings and not medical or scientific ones ) \u2014 it should be no surprise that the vaccine most commonly administered results in the greatest number of filed <MASK> . a better way to compare these data would be to divide the number of successful <MASK> per vaccine by the number of doses of that vaccine given over the same time period . such an approach puts the influenza vaccine below several other shots in terms of successful <MASK> awarded per dose : <PARA> both because the doj never asserted that these data were meant to determine the \u201c most dangerous \u201d vaccine , and because the data released by vicp do not support the notion that the influenza vaccine is actually the \u201c most dangerous \u201d vaccine , the <MASK> that the doj \u201c admitted \u201d to such is rhetorically as well as empirically <MASK> . <PARA> the health impact news <MASK> went on to assert that the reason for this ( imagined ) increased risk in flu vaccinations stemmed from a link between guillain - barr\u00e9 syndrome ( gbs ) and the flu shot . because gbs is thought to be caused by an overzealous immune response , and because the influenza vaccine provokes an immune response , a causal connection between flu vaccines and gbs is often asserted in vaccine courts and on blogs . significant scientific work has been undertaken with an eye towards understanding possible links between gbs and vaccines . while a slightly increased risk of contracting gbs may stem from flu shots , a significantly higher risk of contracting gbs stems from actually contracting the flu , according to a 2013 paper published in the lancet :",

        "text": "<MASK> : one of the ways paperhangers were supposedly able to pass bad checks easily once upon a time was by manipulating the american bankers association ( aba ) numbers encoded on nearly all checks with magnetic ink . although the american banking system relies heavily upon this information for the automated sorting and routing of checks , many bank personnel are unfamiliar with or pay little attention to these numbers . <PARA> the system has changed a little bit over the years , but nowadays checks typically bear a nine - digit aba routing number printed in the bottom left - hand corner ( indicated as # 5 in the above diagram ). in general , the first four digits are a federal reserve routing symbol , <PARA> identifying which of the twelve federal reserve districts the check was printed in ( and a city within that district ). the next four digits are an aba institution identifier which designates the bank on which the check is drawn , and the last number is a check digit . <PARA> check forgers manipulated the banking system by altering the aba routing numbers on the bad checks they passed so that the numbers identified different banks than the ones whose information was printed on the face of those checks . for example , a forger attempting to pass a bad check in boston might present a check whose printed information indicated it was drawn on a philadelphia bank , but whose <PARA> routing number had been altered to indicate that it came from a bank in the 12th federal reserve district ( which encompasses the western united <MASK> ). the boston bank would expect a check drawn on a philadelphia bank to clear within two or three days and assume that if it hadn \u2019 t been kicked back to them by the end of the third day , it was good . however , the altered routing number would cause the automated sorting machinery to send the check on to a san francisco clearing house for processing . once the check arrived in san francisco , a computer there would kick it out because the routing number didn \u2019 t match the other information encoded on the check , and the check would be mailed back to the philadelphia bank for processing . this whole process could take several days , but because the boston bank assumed the check was good after the third day , the forger could withdraw his funds and leave town long before they discovered his check was phony . <PARA> con man frank abagnale ( of catch me if you can fame ) <MASK> in his memoirs that he \u201c was the first check swindler to use the routing numbers racket \u201d in the late 1960s . one of thomas whiteside \u2019 s 1977 new yorker <MASK> included an example of what supposedly happened when a forger altered checks drawn on the chemical bank in new york so that their routing numbers identified them as coming from a los angeles bank : <PARA> although the check bore the name and address of the chemical bank in new york , the federal reserve data - processing system scanned only the magnetic - ink code on it , identified it as a bank of america check , and routed it to los angeles . the check remained in transit for perhaps two days . at the end of that time , it was run through the computer mechanism at the bank of america . the computer , instantly searching its memory for a bank of america account number matching that of the magnetic - ink strip on the check , rejected the check , which then went into a clerical pool for manual handling . since the printed logotype on the check clearly identified it as a check that belonged in the chemical bank in new york , the clerk handling the machine - rejected check sent it back to the chemical bank by mail , assuming that a simple routing error had been made . the check was then in transit for another two days . back at the chemical bank , the check was put into the computerized sorting system for final clearance . but instead of that , it went into motion again : the chemical bank computing system passed it on to the federal reserve system , which routed it out to the los angeles bank again , which routinely sent it back to new york , and so on . <PARA> the fraud was uncovered only when checks issued by the depositor became so frayed from mechanical handling in the computer system that they could no longer be read automatically ... [ b ] y that time , according to an auditor who told me of the affair , the depositor had disappeared with more than $ 1 million in cash . <PARA> the fraud was uncovered only when checks issued by the depositor became so frayed from mechanical handling in the computer system that they could no longer be read automatically ...

assisted refugees such as those to whom this document appears to relate are \u201c referred by the [ u . n . high commissioner for refugees ] to canada because they have been identified as being in need of resettlement .\u201d <PARA> secondly , the document does not relate to one refugee , as the facebook post <MASK> <MASK> . the document clearly shows that these benefits are for a family of five people : <PARA> third , the grand total value of the benefits ($ 3 , 874 cad or $ 2 , 748 usd as of 28 january 2016 ) is not a recurring monthly payment , as the facebook post <MASK> <MASK> . <PARA> the document clearly shows that the majority of benefits listed are one - off \u201c start - up \u201d benefits . the only regular monthly benefits are conveniently labelled \u201c regular monthly benefits ,\u201d and consist of payments for food , rent and transportation , which , because of the size of the family , total $ 1 , 399 cad per month ($ 1 , 094 usd as of 15 november 2017 ). <PARA> these monthly benefits work out to $ 16 , 788 cad ($ 13 , 132 usd ) a year for a family of five ( in addition to \u201c start - up \u201d benefits ). unless there are exceptional circumstances , these resettlement assistance program benefits are only payable to refugees for one year . <PARA> the amounts of benefits depend on the size of the family that receives them . if this document did relate to a single individual ( as the facebook post <MASK> ), the overall monthly payments could be expected to be significantly lower . <PARA> the one - off start - up benefits which bring the total in this particular document to $ 3 , 874 also include a $ 375 loan for a security deposit for housing . being a loan , that amount will have to be repaid to the federal government . <PARA> furthermore , depending on when this particular family arrived in canada , they may be required to pay the canadian government for the cost of their transportation into the country , which takes the form of loan debt . according to the canadian council for refugees , the average loan debt between 2008 and 2012 was $ 3 , 090 cad . <PARA> so while the document in the photograph does appear to be authentic , mike marcoux \u2019 s facebook post constitutes a gross misrepresentation of what \u2019 s actually in it . <PARA> the same document formed the basis of a similarly - outraged post on the right - wing blog \u201c 90 miles from tyranny \u201d in december 2016 . that blog post cited an earlier <MASK> by the now - defunct magafeed web site , which is listed in the fake news codex as a \u201c clickbait site with misleading , poorly [ sourced ], and outright <MASK> stories .\u201d <PARA> it \u2019 s hardly the first time that canada \u2019 s refugee policy has been the subject of <MASK> <MASK> . for example , a factual error in a 2004 letter to the editor of the toronto star spawned a chain email and online memes <MASK> <MASK> that refugees in canada receive more benefits each month than do canadian pensioners . the <MASK> persisted for years . <PARA> similar <MASK> <MASK> have been spread in the country \u2019 s southern neighbor , the united <MASK> , often with the headline \u201c insanity is when illegal refugees get $ 3 , 874 a month in federal assistance while social security checks average $ 1 , 200 a month .\u201d",

        "text": "while those of the starbucks generation may almost think they discovered the drink , coffee , that enticing hot brew , has been part of everyday experience in western society for a number of generations . it has fueled the productivity of countless offices and imparted warm comfort to innumerable half - frozen g . i . s , and it \u2019 s been the prominent beverage in multitudinous housewifely gatherings ( coffee klatches ) and alcoholics anonymous meetings . <PARA> over its <MASK> of popularity in western culture coffee has attracted affectionate nicknames such as \u201c java \u201d and \u201c joe ,\u201d and it is the latter which concerns us , because unlike the <MASK> of the term \u201c java ,\u201d how the beverage came to bear the appellation of \u201c joe \u201d is still a bit of a mystery . ( we colloquially term coffee \u201c java \u201d because at the time the beverage became popular in the 19th century , the primary source of the world \u2019 s coffee was the island of java in indonesia .) <PARA> one theory ascribes the nickname to josephus \u201c joe \u201d daniels who , while secretary of the navy during world war i , imposed a general ban upon the serving of alcohol aboard u . s . navy ships ( albeit with some exceptions for special occasions ). his general order 99 that prohibited alcohol aboard such vessels was issued on 1 june 1914 . by the lights of the daniels supposition , the loss of easy access to booze aboard ships led to increased coffee consumption by naval men , who in response christened their mugs of java \u201c cups of joe \u201d as a sorrowful homage to the man who had banned their hooch and thus forced them into drinking coffee . <PARA> it \u2019 s a charming theory , but it just doesn \u2019 t hold up . prior to 1914 , the u . s . navy had not been sodden with rum and staffed as far as the eye could see by tipsy sailors barely capable of remaining on their feet . rather , the implementation of general order 99 had precious little effect on the lives of enlisted sailors , an already heartily sober lot , because the ships they served on had been officially dry since the spirit ration was abolished in 1862 . officers , however , were affected because they had had access to a \u201c wine mess \u201d from 1893 until the 1914 order put a stop to that . <PARA> there are far fewer officers than there are sailors , thus the impact of general order 99 would have been relatively mild , certainly not the stuff of which rueful sobriquets are coined . moreover , \u201c cup of joe \u201d was first recorded as entering the english language in 1930 , a full 16 years after the grumblings of disgruntled sailing men supposedly put the term into common parlance . to believe the josephus daniels theory is to believe that across that span of time no one \u2014 in the navy or outside it \u2014 wrote down that term in any newspaper <MASK> or letter that has yet come to light ( and guys aboard ships are known for writing letters ). <PARA> there are two stronger theories for how \u201c coffee \u201d came to be \u201c joe ,\u201d but neither is verifiable . the first asserts that \u201c joe \u201d is a corruption of one of two other slang words for coffee : java and jamoke , the latter itself a compression of java and mocha . under that theory , a \u201c cup of jamoke \u201d could easily have slip - slid its way into being a \u201c cup of joe .\u201d people do love to shorten their slang terms , after all . <PARA> the second postulates that since \u201c joe \u201d is argot for a \u201c fellow , guy , chap \u201d ( the earliest sighting of its being used that way dates to 1846 ), that a \u201c cup of joe \u201d thus means the common man \u2019 s drink . the lexicon of english is replete with instances of \u201c joe \u201d being used to denote a typical guy who is wholly interchangeable with any other guy in the same line of work or area of special interest : \u201c g . i . joe ,\u201d \u201c holy joe \u201d ( a chaplain or especially sanctimonious person ), \u201c joe college ,\u201d \u201c joe blow ,\u201d and of course \u201c the average joe .\u201d \u201c cup of joe \u201d therefore would be the stuff that fuels the common man . <PARA> one final theory suggests the term was sired by an mental association of \u201c black \u201d with \u201c coffee ,\u201d with the 1860 stephen foster song old black joe putting it all together . yet the song , the lynchpin of the theory , makes no mention of coffee . moreover , would a song that was hugely popular in 1860 spawn a widespread term that appeared only in 1930 ? <PARA> of the two best theories , jamoke morphing into joe is the strongest contender thanks to this find by linguist michael quinion : \u201c it is significant that an early example appears in 1931 in the reserve officer \u2019 s manual by a man named erdman : \u2018 jamoke , java , joe . coffee . derived from the words java and mocha , where <MASK> the best coffee came from .'\u201d",

        "text": "<MASK> : the letter <MASK> above did indeed appear in the pages of the washington post as a paid advertisement . numerous news stories have reported that it cost actor sean penn $ 56 , 000 to run the ad , which took up most of a page in the first section of the 18 october 2002 edition of the washington post . <PARA> is sean penn right ? it doesn \u2019 t matter \u2014 the point is every american always has opinions about the government , and this condition exists no matter who is in the white house or what he \u2019 s doing . there are going to be people on both sides of any issue , and at times some of them will be famous and / or wealthy . there \u2019 s a larger question here : should the opinions of celebrities or the well - to - do be accorded higher degrees of respect simply because the folks they issue from have the power or money to publicize them ? <PARA> most folks don \u2019 t have the requisite $ 56 , 000 to ensure their views get printed in the washington post and instead have to make do with a 37 \u00a2 stamp and their faith in the u . s . postal service to deliver mail to the white house . this method , by the way , works well when the sole object of the activity is to relay one citizen \u2019 s deeply - felt concerns to the president of his country \u2014 a stamp places that power to be heard into every person \u2019 s hands , no matter how humble . buying space in a newspaper , however , is far less about securing the attention of a president deemed urgently in need of guidance than it is about pontificating to the masses , even if the piece is putatively \u201c addressed \u201d to just one person . it \u2019 s a soapbox grab and an especially arrogant , self - entitled one in that the podium is gained not by virtue of stunning displays of eloquence or irrefutable logic but by way of its having been rented for the day . <PARA> according to the u . s . census bureau , in 1999 the median income for american households was $ 41 , 994 . in other words , the wage earners in a <MASK> typical american family would have to work at least 16 months just to gross what this sean penn paid for a turn on the soapbox . for many of them , including the millions of families living far below the poverty line , $ 56 , 000 is an unimaginable fortune , the likes of which they \u2019 ll never see unless they hit the lottery . they therefore cannot pay to get their opinions published in a newspaper . <PARA> barbara \u201c money talks \u201d mikkelson",

        "text": "in august 2017 , a years - old video excerpt from a presentation by \u201c independent scientist \u201d and conspiracy theorist leuren moret went viral on facebook . in the short clip , moret <MASK> that the relatively high rates of diabetes found in poor and ethnic minority communities in the united <MASK> are caused by the deliberate shipment of radioactive milk to those communities as part of a u . s . government policy of genocide against black americans : <PARA> the video clip was <MASK> disseminated to facebook in april 2015 via the indigengine page , and a month later it was also posted by your black reality . the latter instance of the video experienced an explosion of facebook shares in august and september 2017 . <PARA> although it has proved popular , moret \u2019 s <MASK> lacks both a scientific basis and supporting <MASK> and is <MASK> on a number of levels . its largest scientific misstep is one as old as time : offering mere correlation as support for an untenable hypothesis . <PARA> black americans and type ii diabetes <PARA> african - american adults do have higher rates of diabetes than the general population . the centers for disease control and prevention estimates that the prevalence of diabetes is 9 . 4 percent among american adults overall , but 12 . 7 percent among black american adults . although the increased risk for type ii diabetes among non - latino black men and women is well known and robustly documented , complete explanations for the relationship are lacking . <PARA> scientists agree that both biological and socioeconomic factors are likely at play . one partial explanation is that men and women of african descent appear to differ from other ethnicities in the ways in which their bodies metabolize glucose and regulate its levels , according to a 2012 review of the topic : <PARA> scientists have considered a number of social factors to explain the difference as well , such as access to health care , availability of healthy foods , household <MASK> , and others . a 2015 study conducted by researchers with the national minority quality forum , described on their web site as a \u201c research and educational organization dedicated to ensuring that high - risk racial and ethnic populations and communities receive optimal health care \u201d, noted that although numerous adverse health factors may apply to everyone living in america \u2019 s poorest neighborhoods ( regardless of one \u2019 s ethnicity ), black americans are more likely to reside in such areas : <PARA> moret \u2019 s assertion that radioactive milk explains differing rates of diabetes ignores myriad other racial disparities in health outcomes that likely could not be answered with one single , milk - based hypothesis . a famous 2006 paper nicknamed the \u201c eight americas \u201d study divided the country into eight ethno - sociographic groups ( asians , northland low - income rural whites , middle <MORE> \u2019 s inner cities . to make this argument , she cites reporting published in a controversial 1990 book titled deadly deceit : low - level radiation , high - level cover - up : <PARA> here would be a good place to point out that , in fact , very few dairy farms exist in any urban settings due to the rural environment such farms by necessity must inhabit . as such , it is nearly a given that milk will be shipped from somewhere else to cities . <PARA> moret \u2019 s only <MASK> of targeted radioactive milk shipments to the inner cities , then , is that in august 1986 two cities with larger relative black populations than other east coast cities ( baltimore and washington , d . c .), had higher levels of radiation in their milk . yet she provides no documentation showing an intentional shipment of more radioactive milk to specific neighborhoods within any of these cities , even though that <MASK> is her primary thesis . <PARA> additionally , radioactivity in milk is regularly tested as part of the food and drug administration \u2019 s ( fda ) total diet study , which carefully monitors foodstuffs for a range of potentially harmful substances , including radionuclides . if <MASK> for moret \u2019 s conspiracy theory existed , would it surely not be found more conclusively in these data and not in a single data point from august 1986 ? <PARA> we analyzed the results of the total diet study from 1992 - 2005 and 2006 - 2014 , but we turned up not a single instance of milk \u2019 s containing radionuclide levels that even came close to levels that the fda considers to be potentially harmful . <PARA> could radioactive milk cause diabetes ? <PARA> the final problem with moret \u2019 s argument is the connection between low - level radiation and diabetes . though moret makes great pains to suggest the hazards of low - level radiation have been intentionally minimized by the government , diabetes has been linked to radiation exposure in only a few groups , such as animals exposed to heavy and acute amounts of radiation , or childhood cancer survivors who underwent radiation treatment earlier in their lives ; both groups were exposed to radiation at levels that are much higher than would be found in milk . in response to our queries , the american diabetes association told us that they \u201c are unaware of any link between radiation and diabetes at any levels of radiation that would regularly be encountered in the u . s .\u201d <PARA> moret uses the disparity in health outcomes between impoverished , inner - city black americans and other populations ( arguably one of the most pressing healthcare injustices facing the united <MASK> ) to push a conspiracy theory against nuclear power that lacks both <MASK> and logic . as such , we rank this <MASK> as <MASK> .",

        "text": "the helplessness many homeowners feel during the approach of a destructive storm contributes to the belief of a number of hurricane falsities . while people can get themselves and their loved ones out of the way of a hurricane about to make landfall , they cannot move their homes and so have to abandon them to the ravages of nature . <PARA> homeowners in hurricane areas do try to shield their property from weather - caused damage , but many of the popularly - believed defenses they resort to are ineffective , and one can contribute to far greater degrees of wreckage being visited upon their domiciles . <PARA> that latter tidbit of misinformation asserts that to relieve pressure from building up within the house during a hurricane and causing the building \u2019 s roof to blow off , one should leave a few windows either fully open or slightly cracked . but the opposite is <MASK> : windows should be tightly shut to prevent any of the wind from entering the home . what does enter will seek to exit , in the process blowing out a roof or ceiling , collapsing a gable end or a garage door . wherever the home \u2019 s weak point is , such rogue winds will find it and assault it . <PARA> the notion of keeping some windows slightly cracked open during hurricanes crossed over from what was at one time touted as an effective defense against tornadoes but which has since been discredited . in the wake of <MASK> twisters , it would sometimes appear that a few houses had exploded ; from this <MASK> , scientists theorized air pressure outside had to have been far lower than it was inside , with this disparity causing the blowout . it was therefore suggested people leave their windows open just a bit to equalize pressure . <PARA> however , further research showed those blasted apart houses were the result of wind blowing into open or broken windows , so the advice , rather than preventing this particular form of destruction , would actually work to cause it . those gusts that entered homes pushed up on the roofs at the same time wind was blowing over them , which made the roofs act like airplane wings and generate lifting force . once roofs lift off , the walls of homes can fall outward , making it look like the buildings exploded . <PARA> other widely relied upon modes of protecting one \u2019 s home from the ravages of a hurricane are also ineffective : <PARA> but it \u2019 s not all doom and gloom ; homeowners do have some recourse against the winds . they can install hurricane shutters on their windows or use specially developed new screen and fabric products on them . the mesh and fabric range from about $ 7 to about $ 25 a square foot . <PARA> plywood , while better than nothing , is not the home saver many believe it to be . it can help to guard windows from some of the flying debris loosed by a storm \u2019 s fury . however , against the winds themselves it is not all that effective , even when properly installed ( fitted perfectly to each window and screwed at 18 - inch intervals into the building itself rather than merely into its siding ). plywood is a bulwark of last resort rather than a poor man \u2019 s equivalent of professionally - installed hurricane shutters ; one is not comparable to the other . keep in mind that as federal emergency management agency ( fema ) spokeswoman sylvia e . farrington noted , even a minimal hurricane can drill a 2 - by - 4 through a concrete wall . now imagine how well plywood window coverings would fare . <PARA> one last caution : if you stay in your home during a hurricane and the power goes out , do not light candles or gas or oil lanterns because of the potential for gas leaks from storm - damaged lines . instead , use only flashlights or battery - powered lanterns during and after a storm until power is safely restored and all gas lines are checked .",

( a peacock , for example , can be seen wandering around just outside the tin woodsman \u2019 s shack while dorothy and the scarecrow attempt to revive him with oil .) at the very end of this sequence , as the three main characters move down the road and away from the camera , one of the larger birds ( often said to be an emu , but more probably a crane ) standing at the back of the set moves around and spreads its wings . no munchkin , no hanging \u2014 just a big bird . <PARA> the unusual movement in the background of the scene described above was noticed years ago , and it was often attributed to a stagehand \u2019 s accidentally being caught on the set after the cameras started rolling ( or , more spectacularly , a stagehand \u2019 s falling out of a prop tree into the scene ). with the advent of home video , viewing audiences were able to rewind and replay the scene in question , view it in slow - motion , and look at individual frames in the sequence ( all on screens smaller and less distinct than those of theaters ), and imaginations ran wild . <PARA> the change in focus of the <MASK> from a hapless stagehand to a suicidal munchkin ( driven to despair over his unrequited love for a female munchkin ) seems to have coincided with the heavy promotion and special video re - release of the wizard of oz in celebration of its 50th anniversary in 1989 : someone made up the <MASK> of a diminutive actor who , suffering the pangs of unrequited love for a female \u201c little person ,\u201d decided to end it all right there on the set , and soon everyone was eager to share this special little film \u201c secret \u201d with others . since ( grossly exaggerated ) tales of munchkin lechery and drunken misbehavior on the \u201c oz \u201d set had been circulating for years ( primarily spread by judy garland herself in television talk show appearances ), the wild suicide <MASK> had some seeming background plausibility to it . ( other versions of the <MASK> combined elements from both explanations , such as the <MASK> that the strange figure was actually a stagehand hanging himself .) <PARA> the logistics of this alleged hanging defy all credulity . first of all , the forest scenes in the wizard of oz were filmed before the munchkinland scenes , and thus none of the munchkin actors would yet have been present at mgm . and whether one believes that the figure on the film is a munchkin or a stagehand , it is simply impossible that a human being could have fallen onto a set actively being used for filming , and yet none of the dozens of people present \u2014 actors , directors , cameramen , sound technicians , light operators \u2014 noticed or reacted to the occurrence . ( the tragic incident would also had to have been overlooked by all the directors , editors , film cutters , musicians , and others who worked on the film in post - production as well .) that anyone could believe a scene featuring a real suicide would have been left intact in a classic film for over fifty years is simply incredible .",

did the example he used involve a fetus given a late diagnosis of disability or of a fatal condition , which meant the fetus was \u201c non - viable \u201d and could not survive even after being delivered alive ? when northam said the fetus would be \u201c resuscitated if that \u2019 s what the mother and family desired ,\u201d was he saying he would , hypothetically , support a decision to allow the fetus to die by not providing life - extending medical intervention ? what would be an acceptable outcome , in his view , to the \u201c discussion \u201d that would then take place between the woman and her physicians , and was northam giving tacit support to a decision whereby a physician would withdraw life - extending care or take actions to intentionally end the life of the fetus ? <PARA> we put this list of detailed questions to northam \u2019 s office in order to clarify the exact meaning of his remarks to wtop on 30 january but did not receive a response in time for publication . vox <MASK> a spokesperson for northam as saying that the governor \u2019 s comments were \u201c absolutely not \u201d a reference to infanticide but rather \u201c focused on the tragic and extremely rare case in which a woman with a nonviable pregnancy or severe abnormalities went into labor .\u201d also , according to nbc news , a spokesperson for northam \u201c disputed [ president trump \u2019 s ] characterization \u201d of his comments but did not provide any further clarifying details . <PARA> it \u2019 s clear that northam did not \u201c <MASK> he would execute a baby after birth ,\u201d as trump <MASK> he did . however , his remarks did lack precision and clarity of meaning to the extent that they raised reasonable questions about what exactly he was proposing or advocating . for those reasons , we issue a verdict of \u201c mostly <MASK> .\u201d",

would a similar manual search of records lead to double - counting ? <PARA> we searched news reports from 14 october 2015 forward , finding several \u201c toddler - involved shootings \u201d with a variety of outcomes . young children in acworth and jackson , georgia found guns and shot themselves after the publication of the washington postpiece ( neither survived ); a boy in rock hill , south carolina shot his grandmother but did not kill her ; two - year - old abigail newman was shot in the neck and killed in north carolina in late october ; and a three - year - old was shot and killed by his six - year - old brother in chicago . <PARA> another data complication showed up in the huffington post \u2018 s presentation . their <MASK> emphasized a parallel with terrorism - related deaths and compared toddler - involved shootings with the july 2015 chattanooga mass shooting that killed six ( including the <MORE> left 14 civilians and two attackers dead . by the time the meme reproduced at the top of this page was published on 15 december 2015 , the shooting was still considered an active investigation and details remained fluid . <PARA> initially , investigators adamantly asserted the motives for the shooting were unclear . federal law enforcement agents took over the investigation within a few days , and at that point mentions of \u201c self - radicalization \u201d and \u201c isis sympathizing \u201d officially entered media reports . <PARA> by 16 december 2015 , some of those initial reports were walked back : the blaze reported that there was no <MASK> the shooters were involved in a \u201c terror cell .\u201d wikipedia , which has served as a compendium of multiple reports , classified the incident as \u201c terrorism , mass shooting , [ and ] workplace shooting .\u201d <PARA> what \u2019 s more , on 16 december 2015 the hill reported that initial <MASK> one of the shooters publicly supported \u201c jihad \u201d on facebook had been inaccurate : <PARA> fbi director james b . comey said at the time that although the investigation had shown that farook and malik were radicalized and possibly inspired by foreign terrorist organizations , there was no indication that the couple were directed by such a group or part of a broader cell or network . <PARA> like abdulazeez , malik and farook were muslims . but also like abdulazeez , farook was american , born in chicago . malik was pakistani and lived in saudi arabia before marrying farook , but lived in the united <MASK> as a permanent resident . <PARA> on 17 december 2015 , we contacted christopher ingraham , the washington post journalist whose <MASK> inadvertently sparked all the comparison memes . ingraham confirmed that he continued compiling information on toddler - involved shootings after publishing his october 2015 <MASK> and provided us with updated data . <PARA> noting that \u201c in most cases , the toddlers are killing or injuring themselves ,\u201d ingraham counted 58 total toddler - involved shootings in 2015 as of 17 december of that year . in 19 instances toddlers shot and killed themselves , and in two others toddlers shot and killed other individuals . that brought the total of toddler - involved shooting deaths in the united <MASK> in 2015 to 21 . <PARA> by contrast , if we counted both the chattanooga shootings and san bernardino as instances of islamic terrorism , that would mean 19 americans were killed in instances of suspected , reported , or potential islamic terrorism in 2015 . counting american victims of the november 2015 paris attacks brought that number up to 20 . <PARA> even using the broadest leeway in counting u . s . victims of \u201c islamic terrorism \u201d leads to the same mathematical conclusion : more americans were shot and killed by toddlers in 2015 than were killed by islamic terrorists .",

paying travel - related positions are simultaneously run in a number of cities , or such job postings are listed online . whoever answers these ads is told he will be interviewed in a distant city for his dream job . almost as an afterthought , he will be informed the company requires him to wire money to cover a portion of his airfare , this being the corporation \u2019 s way of ensuring it isn \u2019 t wasting its resources on candidates that don \u2019 t bother to show up . the job prospect is given the promise of this sum \u2019 s being returned to him at his interview , making it seem to the pigeon that he will merely be out of pocket for a few days rather than lose the money permanently . all the while , the about - to - be - gulled is blinded with ongoing patter about fat pay checks , exotic locales , first - class accommodations , and life among the beautiful <PARA> people . <PARA> once the dupe has wired the specified sum to the thief working the con , he will either never again be contacted by the swindler ( who will ditch whichever disposable cell phone he used to make and receive these calls ), or he will be told there has been a change of plan , that instead of being jetted to some distant place for his tete - a - tete with higher management , he will be interviewed locally by a company representative sent to look him over . the local interview will , of course , fall through \u2014 it will either never be set up or it will be arranged then canceled . such additional back -

( some of salvageable portions of the pilot were inserted as flashback scenes in the first season \u2019 s christmas episode , \u201c birds gotta fly , fish gotta talk .\u201d) <PARA> since the gilligan \u2019 s island \u2018 s pilot could not be aired as the series \u2019 introductory episode ( because , as noted above , three of the character roles had been changed and re - cast ), the first episode \u2014 \u201c two on a raft ,\u201d first aired on <MORE> after a nightclub singing engagement still wearing the evening dress from her last performance \u201d; and that the professor was a \u201c research scientist and well - known scoutmaster .\u201d the broadcast mentioned all the characters \u2019 full names as well : <PARA> o jonas grumby ( skipper ) <PARA> o roy hinkley ( the professor ) <PARA> o thurston howell iii ( mr . howell ) <PARA> o \u201c lovey \u201d howell ( mrs . howell ) <PARA> o ginger grant ( ginger ) <PARA> o mary ann summers ( mary ann ) <PARA> <PARA> <URL> <PARA> but that same radio broadcast , the one that provided the full name of every other character on the show , reported only that the crew included a \u201c young first mate named gilligan .\u201d not once in the entire series \u2014 not in the <MASK> ( unaired ) pilot , not in the first episode , not in any subsequent episode \u2014 was any other name associated with the \u2018 gilligan \u2019 character . nor was it ever said , or even implied , at any time that gilligan was anything other than the character \u2019 s first name . <PARA> so , as far as the show was concerned , gilligan had but a single name . it is <MASK> that some early conceptual material for the series did make reference to the name \u2018 willy gilligan ,\u2019 which indicated that gilligan \u2019 s island creator sherwood schwartz did give some consideration \u2014 at least briefly \u2014 to a full name for the character . <PARA> however , that full name was one of the many details that never made it past the early treatment stage and into the show . other elements from the <MASK> series treatment were also dropped along the way , such as the idea that gilligan was an ex - navy cook who knew nothing about the sea but , desperate for a job , convinced the skipper that he was an experienced seaman . instead , the show \u2019 s theme song simply cast gilligan ( ironically ) as a \u201c mighty sailin \u2019 man .\u201d <PARA> moreover , when sherwood schwartz later explained how he came to choose the characters \u2019 names , he made it clear that \u2018 gilligan \u2019 had to have been the character \u2019 s first name , because the howells were the only characters ever referenced by their surnames : <PARA> in short , no name other than \u2018 gilligan \u2019 was ever used for the title character in gilligan \u2019 s island , not even in the <MASK> pilot episode . yes , some <MASK> suggests that series creator sherwood schwartz considered using the name \u2018 willy gilligan \u2019 during the series \u2019 initial planning stages , but schwartz ultimately decided that \u2018 gilligan \u2019 was the character \u2019 s first name , thus precluding the use of \u2018 willy gilligan \u2019 as a full name .",

        "text": "it should come as no surprise to most consumers that many of the flavors found in modern packaged food products are created through the use of chemical flavorings . one example of such is diacetyl , a chemical used in artificial butter flavoring which is commonly found in microwave popcorn . studies have linked diacetyl with the development of the lung disease bronchiolitis obliterans ( a widespread inflammatory and fibrotic obstruction of the small airways ) in industrial flavor workers who experience significant inhalation exposure to the chemical , and various health advocates have pointed to those studies as a reason to call for more stringent governmental regulation over ( or an outright ban on ) the use of diacetyl . <PARA> the question on many people \u2019 s minds , then , is if the link between diacetyl inhalation and bronchiolitis obliterans ( also known as bo , or \u201c popcorn lung \u201d) in industrial workers is indeed causal , does diacetyl pose a danger to consumers with much lower levels of exposure to diacetyl than factory workers , consumers who merely breathe in fumes produced during the heating of artificially butter - flavored microwave popcorn products ? this issue gained prominent public attention in september 2007 via the publication of a letter sent to federal agencies by dr . cecile rose , a pulmonary specialist at denver \u2019 s national jewish medical and research center , saying that doctors at the center believed they had encountered the first case of a consumer \u2019 s developing lung disease from the fumes of microwave popcorn . <PARA> whether this disclosure demonstrates that microwave popcorn poses a significant health risk to ordinary consumers is not so cut - and - dried , though . as dr . rose noted , \u201c this is not a definitive causal link \u201d and \u201c we cannot be sure that this patient \u2019 s exposure to butter flavored microwave popcorn from daily heavy preparation has caused his lung disease \u201d ( although she also noted that doctors had \u201c no other plausible explanation \u201d for the patient \u2019 s symptoms and that the issue \u201c raises a lot of questions and supports the recommendation that more work needs to be done \u201d). additionally , this case might represent far more of an extreme than a norm , as the patient involved \u201c did report daily consumption of several bags of extra butter flavored microwave popcorn for several years \u201d ( at least two bags per day for more than 10 years ) and \u201c when he broke open the bags , after the steam came out , he would often inhale the fragrance because he liked it so much .\u201d <PARA> shortly after the publication of dr . rose \u2019 s letter , the producers of four of the biggest - selling microwave popcorn brands in the u . s . ( orville redenbacher , act ii , pop secret , and jolly time ) announced that they were working to remove diacetyl from their microwave popcorn recipes ( while nonetheless reassuring consumers about the safety of their products ).",

i was swept off my feet \u201d deniability . thus , for some , not taking an active role before the fact preserves the needed illusion that when a chase across the bedsheets occurs it was the unavoidable result of unspeakable and totally unforeseen passion and not at all about anything they \u2019 d made up their minds to ahead of time . <PARA> for those who subscribe to that mindset , \u201c you can \u2019 t get pregnant if . . .\u201d myths are practically the only defense they have against becoming mothers before they \u2019 re ready to . lurking in the back of their minds is the notion that everything will be fine provided there \u2019 s a can of coca - cola near to hand or their boyfriends pull out in time . <PARA> one odd bit of old wives \u2019 lore does have something to it , though : a gal who is nursing one baby is unlikely to become pregnant with another . <PARA> breastfeeding cuts down on the female hormone needed to prompt ovulation , thus the chance of conceiving during this time is markedly lower than at others . still , gals have ended up with number 2 because they placed their faith in nursing number 1 to prevent conception , so this shouldn \u2019 t be mistaken for anything surefire . breastfeeding is deemed nature \u2019 s contraceptive , but for it to work , the new mom has to nurse her child exclusively . it \u2019 s the regular suckling of the babe that prompts the mother \u2019 s body to hold back the next egg . trips to the formula bottle or attempts to start junior on solid food can interrupt this process . <PARA> teen pregnancy is a reality that will be with us for a long time ;

<PARA> what it all came down to was that president bush ( whose popularity rating had been at a record high just a year earlier ) became the scapegoat for an economic recession . once the hoopla over the persian gulf war receded into the past and americans once again turned their attention to more mundane matters ( i . e ., money ), bush \u2019 s public image shifted from \u201c conquering hero \u201d to \u201c politician befuddled by economic matters .\u201d he had told us that a recession wouldn \u2019 t happen , and now that it was here , all he had to say about it was that it would end soon . <PARA> even if bush had been in a grocery store or two since the advent of scanners , everybody knew he had \u201c people \u201d to do his shopping for him , and therefore it was easy to paint a picture of him as someone who no more knew how to handle the economy than he knew the price of a carton of milk or a loaf of bread . all that was needed was a hook to hang the picture on , and bush \u2019 s encounter with a scanner at the national grocers \u2019 convention provided it .",

        "text": "in 1969 , the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) began collecting nationwide data on the numbers of abortions , the abortion ratio ( abortions versus live births ), and the abortion rate ( abortions versus the us population of women aged 15 - 44 years old ). <PARA> while these data are not perfect due to inconsistent ( and sometimes non - existent ) reporting from different <MASK> , they can be used to analyze relative changes in abortion rates during the presidencies of different presidential parties , as we will do here using numbers from the cdc \u2019 s annual abortion surveillance study . red portions of the lines show the ratio and rates of abortions occurring under republican administrations , and blue under democratic administrations : <PARA> before delving into the specific relationship between abortions and the political party affiliation of the president , the complete data set should be analyzed as a whole to provide context . this is how the cdc describes the overall trend in their data : <PARA> the large uptick in legal abortions though the \u2019 70s is related to the the landmark 1973 roe v . wade decision , in which the united <MASK> supreme court ruled that a woman \u2019 s right to an abortion is protected under the right to privacy of the due process clause of the 14th amendment . <PARA> it is plain to see that abortion rates have risen ( prior to their peaking in the mid - 1980s ) and fallen under both democratic and republican administration , suggesting little to no correlation with whichever political party controls the white house . the overall trend since the 1980s has been a fairly consistent decline across through administrations of both parties . <PARA> it would be easy to demonstrate that abortion rates have not risen under democratic administrations in the last several decades , but it would be <MASK> to argue that declines in abortion rates are an exclusive feature of democratic presidencies . the <MASK> that abortion rates fall under democrats , while <MASK> , ignores the fact that rates have also continued to decline through republican administrations as well . <PARA> the <MASK> , then , that abortion rates ( at least since their mid - 1980s peak ) have risen when republicans have held the white house is therefore equally <MASK> . at most , one can argue that the rate of decline appeared to slow during the presidency of george w . bush before increasing under president barack obama \u2019 s administration , but such an observation would be based on a comparison between only two administrations and would do nothing to demonstrate causation . <PARA> in fact , causation between the presidency and abortion rates would be difficult to demonstrate in any case because it is hard to draw a straight line between federal government policy ( let alone presidential policy ) and abortion procurement . nearly all challenges to open access to abortion have come at the <MASK> , and not the federal , level . according to a 2013 report by the pro - choice guttmacher institute : <PARA> at the federal level , legislators have had more trouble passing abortion restrictions into law , making it difficult to argue that any presidential policy , specifically , has had an effect on abortion rates . the only relevant federal legislation that has been signed into law are the 1976 hyde amendment , which prohibited federal money from funding ( most ) abortions , and the partial - birth abortion ban act of 2003 , which criminalized abortions in the second trimester of pregnancy and was upheld as constitutional by the supreme court in 2007 . <PARA> what one can say , though , is that federal or myriad <MASK> - level regulations put in place do not appear to produce much of a change in abortion rates , according to a 2014 study by the guttmacher institute : <PARA> according to the cdc , multiple factors can affect abortion rates , including those such as contraception and demographic changes that have an effect on the demand for ( as opposed to availability of ) abortions :",

        "text": "<MASK> : \u201c the \u201d legend about \u201c gloomy sunday \u201d is a sort of meta - legend that encompasses the following <MASK> : <PARA> a little background for those not familiar with this legend : <PARA> \u201c gloomy sunday \u201d was written in 1933 by two hungarians : rezso seress ( music ) and laszlo javor ( lyrics ). the song supposedly drew little ( adverse ) attention until 1936 , when it began to be connected with a rash of suicides in hungary and was allegedly banned there . american musicians and singers soon jumped at the chance to record instrumental and translated versions of the \u201c hungarian suicide song ,\u201d and by the end of 1936 several recordings were available to american audiences . ( the billie holiday version , recorded several years later , was probably the most popular english - language version of \u201c gloomy sunday .\u201d) <PARA> the english lyrics ( which reportedly don \u2019 t do justice to the <MASK> hungarian ) go something like this : <PARA> sunday is gloomy , my hours are slumberless . <PARA> dearest , the shadows i live with are numberless . <PARA> little white flowers will never awaken you , <PARA> not where the black coach of sorrow has taken you . <PARA> angels have no thought of ever returning you . <PARA> would they be angry if i thought of joining you ? <PARA> gloomy sunday . <PARA> gloomy is sunday ; with shadows i spend it all . <PARA> my heart and i have decided to end it all . <PARA> soon there \u2019 ll be candles and prayers that are sad , i know . <PARA> death is no dream , for in death i \u2019 m caressing you . <PARA> with the last breath of my soul i \u2019 ll be blessing you . <PARA> gloomy sunday . <PARA> gloomy is sunday ; with shadows i spend it all . <PARA> my heart and i have decided to end it all . <PARA> soon there \u2019 ll be candles and prayers that are sad , i know . <PARA> death is no dream , for in death i \u2019 m caressing you . <PARA> with the last breath of my soul i \u2019 ll be blessing you . <PARA> gloomy sunday . <PARA> on to the legends : <PARA> i don \u2019 t know how any of these <MASK> could be verified short of paging through old hungarian newspapers ; even then , it would be difficult at this late date to separate exaggerated and fabricated reports from <MASK> ones . i suspect that this portion of the legend is trivially <MASK> , a combination of hungary \u2019 s historically high suicide rate and the assumption of a causal \u2014 rather than a coincidental \u2014 relationship between the song and suicides that caused <MASK> and media reports to be greatly exaggerated . <PARA> hungary has had the highest suicide rate of any country for many years ( as high as 45 . 9 per 100 , 000 people in 1984 ), so a few dozen suicides there over a year \u2019 s time certainly wouldn \u2019 t have been unusual , even in 1936 . nor is it at all uncommon for suicides to work something from popular songs or books or films into their deaths . only when one particular song was coincidentally linked to a sufficient number of suicides to draw attention to all the suicides in which it played a part did people start to <MASK> that it was somehow the cause of these deaths .",

once those suspects were identified , they were promptly arrested and charged with a multiplicity of crimes , hence lion \u2019 s murder was never associated with a public perception of \u201c justice denied \u201d or the suggestion that his race was an element of either the commission or prosecution of his killing . <PARA> the sad fact is that the u . s . sees about 16 , 000 homicides per year , a number which precludes more than a scant handful of them receiving national news coverage \u2014 generally the ones that do garner national attention involve political or social controversy ( trayvon martin ), lurid details ( jodi arias ), celebrities ( o . j . simpson ), or victims such as pregnant women , mothers , and children who are perceived as particularly vulnerable and sympathetic ( laci peterson , casey anthony ). <PARA> marley lion \u2019 s death , although no less important than anyone else \u2019 s , involved none of the extraordinary factors that propel a few select homicide cases into the national spotlight , so \u2014 just like thousands of other murder victims \u2014 his death remained a local news <MASK> .",

        "text": "on 2 november 2017 , the disreputable web site neon nettle reported <MASK> that seven \u201c key witnesses \u201d to the mass shooting on the las vegas strip one month earlier had died under \u201c suspicious circumstances \u201d, and that there was a \u201c sinister \u201d plot afoot to snuff out people who made <MASK> in the immediate aftermath of the massacre that appeared to support the conspiracy theory trope that there was more than one shooter that night . <PARA> law enforcement leading the investigation into the massacre have concluded that stephen paddock , 64 , was the lone gunman on 1 october 2017 , when he opened fire with a modified weapon from the 32nd floor of the mandalay bay resort and casino onto a crowd below attending an outdoor country music festival . neon nettle , along with other conspiratorial web sites , have been aggressively pushing the idea that paddock had an accomplice . conspiracy buffs have decided that the las vegas shooting was yet another massive cover - up \u2014 a \u201c <MASK> flag ,\u201d or government - engineered catastrophe meant to facilitate a nationwide gun - grab in the service of an ominous global cabal waiting in the wings to seize world power . <PARA> with great paranoia , neon nettle reported : <PARA> none of the deaths of \u201c key witnesses \u201d mentioned in the neon nettle <MASK> were linked , other than the fact some of them were part of a crowd of at least 22 , 000 people attending the outdoor route 91 harvest festival when the shooting took place . among the seven named , two died in an apparent car accident . one appears to have been misidentified by conspiracy theorists . a third is , in fact , not dead , while another had serious medical complications . in another instance , the deceased had no link whatsoever to the mass shooting , while the final \u201c key witness \u201d named , in display of sheer laziness by neon nettle , is paddock , the shooter . <PARA> dennis and lorraine carver : lorraine carver allegedly wrote on social media that her husband protected her from \u201c shooters \u201d. carver and her husband dennis were killed on 16 october 2017 in a car accident near their home in murrieta , california , when their car veered off a curve in a road at 10 : 50 p . m ., striking a metal gate and catching fire . both were pronounced dead at the scene . <PARA> danny contreras : on 23 october 2017 , police and fire personnel discovered the body of danny contreras , 35 , who died of multiple gunshot wounds in a vacant home in las vegas . police said they believe the homicide was narcotics - related . according to neon nettle , a now - suspended twitter account apparently being used by a person using that name posted that he was lucky <MORE> for the murdered man launched on 25 october 2017 in north las vegas and the profile picture of the man pointed out by neon nettle appears to demonstrate that they are in fact two different people . <PARA> chad nishimura : neon nettle initially and <MASK> reported nishimura , a mandalay bay hotel worker \u201c disappeared \u201d after he told a local news <MASK> he had valeted paddock \u2019 s car and said paddock \u201c didn \u2019 t have any crazy bags with him that i can remember .\u201d the conspiratorial web site is now reporting nishimura was murdered outside the las vegas church , iglesia la luz del mundo . a man named hector antonio lemus - flores , 45 , of north las vegas , was murdered on 16 october 2017 outside that church . neon nettle simply transposed the details of lemus - flores \u2019 death onto their <MASK> to <MASK> <MASK> the victim had been nishimura , who is alive . <PARA> kymberley suchomel : 28 - year - old suchomel passed away in her sleep a week after the massacre . according to her grandmother , who found her in bed in her apple valley , california home on 9 october 2017 , suchomel had seizures and was taking medication for a tumor . suchomel was apparently experiencing trouble sleeping as sounds and images from the massacre would terrorize her at night . she drew the attention of conspiracy theorists with a now - private facebook post attributed to her in which she said there was more than one shooter , writing : <PARA> john beilman : on 4 october 2017 , beilman , 60 , shot and killed his severely - disabled 27 - year - old daughter in the backyard of their fairport , new york home before turning the gun on himself . there is no connection between that tragedy and the las vegas massacre \u2014 a link between the two deadly incidents was established exclusively by disreputable conspiracy sites like whatdoesitmean . according to rationalwiki , the work on that web site is of such quality that \u201c even other conspiracy nutters don \u2019 t think much of it .\u201d <PARA> the seventh \u201c key witness \u201d included on neon nettle \u2019 s list is the shooter himself , stephen paddock . after shooting at the crowd for 10 minutes , paddock turned his weapon on himself . of course paddock wasn \u2019 t a \u201c witness .\u201d he was the perpetrator . he was included in the list perhaps as an effort to ramp up the cloak - and - dagger effect or simply beef up the body count \u2014 neon nettle implied there had been suspicious circumstances for his death as well : <PARA> according to police radio traffic which can be found archived at broadcastify , paddock did not exchange gunfire with police . when they breached the door and went inside , paddock was already down .",

alive baby in a jar of \u2018 solution \u2019 to drown her . they also say to \u2018 flush \u2019 the baby down the toilet , or \u2018 put it in a bag \u2019 if she \u2019 s born alive .\u201d <PARA> the following day , live action tweeted the same video clip along with the message : \u201c watch this new york abortion worker tell our investigator to \u2018 flush \u2019 the baby down the toilet or \u2018 put it in a bag \u2019 if she \u2019 s born alive .\u201d <PARA> on 21 february , the pro - life web site lifenews . com reported that \u201c an undercover video resurfaced this week of a new york abortion worker telling a woman to drown her baby in a toilet if the baby is born alive before the abortion is complete .\u201d <PARA> in each of these three prominent examples , live action , its president , and the website lifenews . com <MASK> that the worker had advised the woman posing as a would -

life , non - profit organization best known for publishing undercover \u201c sting \u201d videos recorded at health centers run by planned parenthood and other abortion providers . <PARA> in april 2013 , the group published two such videos <MORE> as live action described it . <PARA> whatever one \u2019 s view is of the clinic employee \u2019 s language and tone during the conversation , it \u2019 s not clear that she had in mind a live birth or a viable fetus that has survived laminaria dilation when she said \u201c flush it .\u201d <PARA> this is because , shortly before the remarks in question , the employee had been telling the woman that the insertion of the laminaria sticks \u201c stops the heartbeat \u201d of the fetus . this is not accurate , but the employee may have had in mind the fact that , in a dilation and evacuation procedure , the insertion of the laminaria sticks is sometimes accompanied by the injection of digoxin , a medication that induces cardiac arrest in the fetus . in part , this is done to ensure the demise of the fetus before its remains are removed in the evacuation phase , and it \u2019 s one of the reasons why there are so few live births after abortions , especially in the second trimester . <PARA> although the employee appeared to be confused or misinformed about the effects of laminaria dilation , it seems perfectly plausible that she had in mind a fetus whose heart had already been stopped when the activist asked her , \u201c what if it pops out at home ?\u201d <PARA> ultimately , however , the employee \u2019 s remarks are not objectively clear in their meaning or intended meaning . we sent director gelvez a list of questions relating to the employee \u2019 s comments and their intended meaning , as well as asking whether the woman was still employed at the clinic or had undergone additional training or disciplinary proceedings . unfortunately , we did not receive a response to those questions . <PARA> without being able to clarify either the meaning or intended meaning of the employee \u2019 s remarks , we issue a rating of \u201c unproven \u201d in relation to the <MASK> of lifenews and live action that the clinic employee said she would \u201c drown \u201d a living , viable baby or instructed a would -

contradictory in ways that are salient to the question of what she actually meant . it should also be noted that in the same video , and despite pressure and incitement by the undercover activist , the designated counselor at the clinic clearly and unequivocally outlined a policy whereby , in the extremely unlikely event that a fetus survived an abortion , the clinic would attempt to resuscitate and revive it . <PARA> staff writer david emery contributed to this <MASK> .",

        "text": "the outbreak of violence at a white nationalist rally in charlottesville , virginia , in august 2017 led to renewed debate in the united <MASK> about the appropriateness and meaning of public monuments to confederate figures . was removing <MASK> , memorials , and other commemorations of those who fought on the southern side in the civil war a form of \u201c political correctness \u201d tantamount to \u201c changing <MASK> \u201d, or was it a justified end to displaying \u201c explicit symbols of white supremacy \u201d in america \u2019 s public spaces ? <PARA> that debate included , typically , the circulation via social media of memes attempting to foster skewed historical perspectives on the civil war and slavery , including this one which juxtaposed purported <MASK> from president abraham lincoln and confederate general robert e . lee on those subjects : <PARA> the <MASK> attributed to lincoln in that meme was but an incomplete reproduction of a single sentence that was plucked from a longer piece of correspondence and offered without a shred of context , a misleading technique used to create the <MASK> impression that lincoln said the exact opposite of what he actually meant . <PARA> the line \u201c if i could save the union without freeing any slave i would do it ...\u201d comes from an open letter lincoln wrote in august 1862 to new - york tribune editor horace greeley , who had recently published an editorial criticizing lincoln for being \u201c strangely and disastrously remiss \u201d in efforts to emancipate slaves . in his response , lincoln made it clear that his single , paramount goal in waging war was to restore the union as quickly as possible and \u201c not [ to ] either to save or to destroy slavery ,\u201d and that he disagreed with those who asserted that his goal should necessarily encompass either the abolition or the preservation of slavery : <PARA> it \u2019 s also important to note that in his closing , lincoln drew a clear distinction between what he felt his political duty required of him ( i . e ., preservation of the union and not a forced , unilateral abolition of slavery ) and what his personal viewpoint on the slavery issue was ( i . e ., a \u201c wish that all men every where could be free \u201d). <PARA> as for the <MASK> attributed to general lee , about his supposed wish ( expressed on eve of the civil war ) that he wished he \u201c owned every slave in the south \u201d so that he could head off the conflict by \u201c free [ ing ] them all ,\u201d there is no record of lee \u2019 s having expressed any such sentiment . the closest one can come to finding any documentation of lee \u2019 s having said anything similar is a reminiscence published by presbyterian pastor john leyburn in century magazine in 1885 , some fourteen years after lee \u2019 s death . <PARA> in that reminiscence , the rev . dr . leyburn ( who , like lee , was a virginian but relocated to baltimore after the conclusion of the civil war ) <MASK> that he had engaged lee in conversation in 1869 while the latter was in baltimore in connection with a railroad project . according to leyburn , during that conversation the former confederate general averred that he had not waged war over the issue of slavery , that he \u201c was rejoiced \u201d that slavery had been abolished , and that he would \u201c cheerfully have lost all i have lost by the war \u201d in order to see the end of slavery : <PARA> even this passage , which does not match the <MASK> attributed to lee above , is problematic in several ways : primarily that the purported conversation was witnessed by no one other than the person who reported it , that it was not disclosed until some sixteen years after the fact , and that lee was long dead by the time it emerged and thus could not confirm or deny it . moreover , even if it were correctly reported , we can \u2019 t determine at this remove whether it truly reflected lee \u2019 s beliefs at the time , or whether it was part a post - war effort by lee to resurrect his reputation in the north . <PARA> much could be written about lee \u2019 s attitude towards slavery , but perhaps the best single example of it ( and one of the few expressed in his own words ) is a letter he penned to his wife in 1856 , in which he described slavery as \u201c a moral and political evil \u201d and anticipated its eventual abolition , but in which he also maintained that slavery was a greater evil to white people than to black people , and that black people were better off living enslaved in america than living free in africa : <PARA> or , as civil war historian eric foner described lee \u2019 s mixed viewpoint on slavery more succinctly in the new york times :",

( rather than the lest we forget black holocaust museum of philadelphia ). a curator explained that such items were supposedly often gifted to mistresses for use with their slaves but correctly noted that the <MASK> of slavery is often documented forensically in an absence of surviving written records , so little else is definitively known about the collar . <PARA> the web site for colonial williamsburg reports that affluent americans owners sometimes placed collars made of precious metal on their slaves as <MASK> symbols : <PARA> according to the smithsonian , slave collars made of iron were used to \u201c discipline and identify slaves who were considered risks of becoming runaways ,\u201d but their pictured example looks significantly different than the museum piece shown above : <PARA> tiffany sent along a picture showing an object very much visually like the museum \u201c slave collar ,\u201d this one identified as a sterling silver dog collar made by tiffany circa 1884 : <PARA> the museum piece indeed bears resemblance to tiffany & co .\u2019 s \u201c return to tiffany \u201d collection , and discomfort with that visual likeness is one reason viewers have reacted negatively to the <MASK> positing a connection between the two . however , tiffany & co . pieces from the period of time charles lewis tiffany headed the company ( from 1837 until his death in 1902 ) tend to be based on expensive gemstones , diamonds , or silverware ; the company didn \u2019 t commonly adopt their now - iconic simple silver heart designs until around 1969 . but tiffany \u2019 s core fortune ( on which he built his empire ) supposedly involved pre - civil war cotton industry wealth likely derived in part from slave labor , a detail often elided from official histories of tiffany & co .",

        "text": "among the many conspiracy theories surrounding the october 2017 mass shooting in las vegas , nevada is one that involves chad nishimura , a mandalay bay hotel valet worker who said he parked suspected shooter stephen paddock \u2019 s car on his arrival at the hotel . <PARA> according to conspiracy theorists , nishimura told a reporter in his native hawaii that paddock did not appear to have many bags with him , thus contradicting the \u201c official \u201d narrative that paddock acted alone , and prompting nishimura \u2019 s sinister disappearance . on 10 october 2017 , the disreputable and rarely accurate web site neon nettle wrote : <PARA> there is no <MASK> that nishimura has disappeared or been reported missing , and this account contains several important factual errors and logical mistakes , typical of much of the content that neon nettle and other sites of its ilk publish . <PARA> it is <MASK> that nishimura spoke to kitv 4 , a honolulu abc affiliate , for an <MASK> published on 3 october 2017 that has since been deleted : <PARA> ( an archived version of the <MASK> can be viewed here .) <PARA> the first thing to note here is that nishimura did not say stephen paddock didn \u2019 t have many bags . he said paddock didn \u2019 t have any \u201c crazy bags \u201d and brought \u201c nothing weird \u201d that he could could remember . further , it requires a logical leap to propose that if stephen paddock didn \u2019 t have much luggage with him upon arriving at the mandalay bay hotel , it follows that he must have had an accomplice in the 1 october 2017 mass shooting . nothing in nishimura \u2019 s account of meeting paddock eliminates the possibility that paddock made multiple trips to the hotel , therefore making that particular conspiracy theory surrounding nishimura fall down on this logical point alone . <PARA> neon nettle also attributes the removal of the kitv 4 <MASK> to \u201c higher - ups at abc taking issue with a report that conflicts with the narrative they are pushing on the public ,\u201d and <MASK> <MASK> that the reporter moanike \u2019 ala nabarro had declined to answer readers who asked why the <MASK> had been deleted . <PARA> in fact , nabarro gave a clear answer to this question on 7 october 2017 , three days before neon nettle published its <MASK> , saying that the decision was made in order to protect nishimura \u2019 s privacy : <PARA> finally , there is no <MASK> that chad nishimura has \u201c vanished \u201d \u2014 mysteriously or otherwise \u2014 and in fact , there is <MASK> to contradict this <MASK> . <PARA> according to neon nettle , nishimura \u201c has completely vanished since the report was published , with all of his social media accounts being scrubbed from the internet .\u201d <PARA> this is completely and provably <MASK> . nishimura has been active on facebook after 3 october , the publication date of the kitv 4 <MASK> which \u2014 at least according to the conspiracy theory being pushed here \u2014 prompted his \u201c disappearance \u201d. ( his facebook account remains active , but we are not linking to it in the interest of protecting nishimura \u2019 s privacy from readers provoked by the groundless conspiracy theory peddled and promulgated by neon nettle and others .) <PARA> on 5 october 2017 , nishimura wrote : <PARA> furthermore , the las vegas metropolitan police department has not listed nishimura as a missing person . <PARA> this conspiracy theory is illogical , not supported by any <MASK> , contradicted by other <MASK> , and is <MASK> . neon nettle has a <MASK> of publishing inaccurate conspiracy theories , hoaxes and other fabricated content . the chad nishimura case joins a laundry list of conspiracy theories and hoaxes revolving around the october 2017 mass shooting in las vegas .",

        "text": "during the first three months of 2018 , president trump made good on a core campaign promise by announcing a series of import tariffs to protect american industries from what he described as the unfair trade practices of other countries . <PARA> in january , he imposed tariffs on washing machines and solar panels aimed at reducing cheap imports from china and south korea . a few weeks later , on 1 march , he announced a 10 percent tariff on aluminum imports and a 25 percent tariff on steel . <PARA> the latter had the unintended consequence of sparking a stock sell - off on wall street , reflecting investors \u2019 fears of a looming international trade war and inflation . predictably , the stock prices of american steel producers rose in response to the tariff announcement . those of auto makers and other businesses heavily dependent on foreign steel took a hit . <PARA> one of the latter was the crane manufacturer manitowoc , whose share price tumbled from $ 29 . 72 the day before the announcement to $ 26 . 93 the day after . that surprised no one , but something curious did happen over the few weeks just prior to trump \u2019 s speech . according to a 2 march report by progressive news site think progress , billionaire investor carl icahn , a former economic regulatory adviser to trump , sold off $ 31 . 3 million worth of manitowoc stock : <PARA> without ever mentioning the phrase \u201c insider trading ,\u201d the <MASK> \u2019 s author , judd legum , implied that such may have taken place , highlighting what he termed the \u201c impeccable timing \u201d of icahn \u2019 s sell - off . other sources , including the new york times , bloomberg , and washington post , noted the timing as well . bloomberg reported : <PARA> though trump and icahn \u2019 s relationship stretches back many years and they \u2019 re sometimes described as \u201c longtime friends \u201d ( think progress called icahn a \u201c confidant \u201d of trump \u2019 s ), the washington post has characterized their association as highly competitive and centered more around business than friendship . <PARA> \u201c i \u2019 ve known him over the years , as an acquaintance . i like him ,\u201d the post <MASK> icahn as saying . \u201c but i don \u2019 t see him all that much . i \u2019 m pretty much a workaholic .\u201d though icahn served as an special adviser to the president on regulatory reform during the first half of 2017 , he resigned the informal , unpaid position when allegations of conflicts of interest surfaced ( icahn denied the allegations ). in a 1 march television interview , icahn said he hadn \u2019 t had much interaction with trump \u201c in the last four or five months .\u201d <PARA> even so , think progress ran a follow - up <MASK> <MASK> duke university law professor james d . cox , an expert on insider trading , to the effect that the timing of icahn \u2019 s stock sell - off \u201c was \u2018 awfully suspicious \u2019 and \u2018 unquestionably \u2019 warrants a federal investigation \u201d: <PARA> npr reported on 3 march that a white house spokesman had dismissed allegations that insider information was exchanged on the grounds that \u201c trump has long said both publicly and privately that he wanted to impose tariffs .\u201d <PARA> on 5 march , the nonpartisan watchdog group project on government oversight ( pogo ) released a letter calling on the securities exchange commission ( sec ) to investigate icahn for possible insider trading . <PARA> on 7 march , icahn categorically denied receiving advance notice of the tariff announcement in a terse <MASK> posted on his web site ( emphasis in the <MASK> ): <PARA> a 23 february analysis of icahn \u2019 s manitowoc sell - off by research analyst matt hogan characterized the company \u2019 s stock as overvalued and underperforming , and the company \u2019 s projected growth in comparison to its peer group as \u201c mediocre .\u201d manitowoc \u2019 s share prices had been falling steadily since 26 january . <PARA> although there is precedent for pursuing insider trading charges against government officials and others who misappropriate nonpublic government information for profit , academic experts on insider trading told us that the evidentiary bar for proving that an illicit exchange of privileged information took place is quite high , making prosecution in a case like this , given what we know , unlikely . moreover , the information in question pertained to a policy change with broad potential effects on entire industries . insider trading charges more typically revolve around the misappropriation of so - called \u201c material information \u201d specific to particular companies and products . <PARA> as of this writing , the sec has not publicly responded to pogo \u2019 s demand for an investigation , and declined our invitation to comment on the matter .",

        "text": "nowadays , a worker who is permanently dismissed from their job is generally said to be \u201c terminated \u201d or \u201c fired ,\u201d or possibly \u201c laid off \u201d if their dismissal was not for cause . and notice of termination is typically delivered to an employee via a face - to - face meeting with their supervisor or a human resources manager rather than in writing . <PARA> for about a century , however , american workers from all walks of life lived in fear of one day being \u201c pink slipped \u201d \u2014 that is , receiving a notice printed on a pink slip of paper , usually distributed with their paycheck , informing them that their services were no longer required by their employer ( that is , they were fired ). <PARA> the <MASK> of the phrase \u2018 pink slip \u2019 remain a mystery , however . nobody can seem to document that it was ever a common or widespread practice in the u . s . for workers who had been laid off or fired to receive notification of their dismissals via pink slips of paper . so , did the term \u201c pink slip \u201d really come about because long ago , a company ( or companies ) used to dismiss employees by distributing termination of employment notices printed on pink paper , or was the term always a symbolic rather than a literal one ? <PARA> over the years people have offered plenty of examples of companies that supposedly used pink slips to fire their employees , but none has ever been verified . the most common explanation predictably concerns the ford motor company ( as henry ford and his business are commonly viewed as the prototype that established the modern corporate employer - employee business relationship ): <PARA> however , this anecdote about ford is just that , an anecdote with nothing behind it other than sheer repetition . no <MASK> documents that ford ever used pink and white slips of paper to indicate evaluation of employees \u2019 job performance . <PARA> peter liebhold , a curator at the smithsonian institution \u2019 s national museum of american <MASK> in washington , d . c ., has spent years searching for an example of an actual pink slip , but even though he and his colleagues have turned up similar artifacts ( such as the red twill used to bundle documents in the 19th century , a symbol we now know as bureaucratic \u201c red tape \u201d), the dreaded pink slip has remained elusive : <PARA> the oxford english dictionary \u2018 s oldest citation for the term \u201c pink slip \u201d comes from a 1904 <MASK> published in a typographical journal , with the usage suggesting that a pink slip was not itself a notice of termination , but rather a warning issued in that industry when an employee did not perform his job adequately \u2014 the accumulation of too many \u201c pink slips \u201d could therefore result in one \u2019 s dismissal from employment : <PARA> but if no company ever really used pink slips before \u201c pink slip \u201d entered the language , then where did the term come from ? <PARA> other languages have also used terms for dismissals related to colorful paperwork : germans would \u201c get the blue letter \u201d (\u201c den blauen brief bekommen \u201d), and the french military dismissed personnel with a \u201c yellow paper \u201d (\u201c cartouche jaune \u201d). but perhaps the \u201c pink slip \u201d doesn \u2019 t have anything to do with color at all . <PARA> consider that we often use terms relating to injury or violence to describe the severing of a relationship ( e . g ., a fired employee has \u201c gotten the axe ,\u201d a player who doesn \u2019 t make the team is said to have been \u201c cut \u201d), and that when used as a verb , \u201c pink \u201d means \u201c to pierce \u201d or \u201c to stab \u201d ( hence the item known as \u201c pinking shears \u201d) or \u201c to wound by criticism or ridicule .\u201d perhaps \u201c pink slip \u201d is related more to the symbolic notion of being stabbed in the heart than to actual colored pieces of paper . <PARA> curiously , the term \u201c pink slip \u201d was also formerly synonymous with the concept of automobile ownership , as \u201c having the pink slip \u201d meant that you possessed a vehicle \u2019 s certificate of title and thus owned it free and clear . in this case , the phrase arose because automotive titles really were issued on pink slips of paper , but not everywhere \u2014 the practice was most common in california , and the influence of that car - crazy <MASK> was enough to make the term common parlance across the u . s .",

if you have a family member or a friend who has a disability or know someone with a disability please share this . this filed trip turned out to be more than a life skills and social skills lesson , they were exposed to discrimination !! please share this with everyone you know !! people with disabilities do have money to spend , and they did spend money on our trip today !! <PARA> <MASK> : on 6 november 2014 , a facebook user posted the above - <MASK> <MASK> about her experience at the chesterfield mall in missouri . according to her account , <PARA> although other stores in the mall had warmly welcomed her party , the manager of the chesterfield bath & body works was uniquely unkind to her small group of disabled students . <PARA> not long after the first post , the woman updated her facebook page to link to a news <MASK> about a similar <MASK> involving a bath & body works store in alabama . additionally , she reposted the <MASK> of two fellow teachers or school staff members who described the same initial <MASK> stemming from the students \u2019 visit to bath & body works on 6 november 2014 : <PARA> i am respectfully asking each of you to boycott the bath & body works at chesterfield mall ( the actual mall , not the outlet ). we took our students to the mall to work on a life skills scavenger hunt today and the man that was working there prevented three of our groups of <MORE> rethink your shopping trip at christmas time and bypass the chesterfield bath & body works ! i have a feeling that boycotting that store will hurt his sales much more than our presence in his precious store ! and by the way , corporate office , mall manager and other b & b works locations have been contacted by several of us . <PARA> fyi our special needs students had the opportunity to take a community access field trip to chesterfield mall today ! what a wonderful time they had ordering their lunch , riding the carousel and working on social skills . unfortunately they also experienced the cruelty of discrimination at bath & body works . three groups of no more than 3 - 4 ( including at least one staff member ) were met by an employee with arms outstretched refusing them access to the store ! they were told only purchasing customers were allowed in and they would hurt his business ! apparently our kiddos didn \u2019 t \u201c look \u201d like they were there to buy anything from their store . shame on him ! our own casey brown calmly approached him to inquiry about the treatment of the students and was equally treated rudely ! everyday we stress the importance of treating each other with kindness , respect and understanding with these children . and yet this man clearly never got them memo . <PARA> so maybe rethink your shopping trip at christmas time and bypass the chesterfield bath & body works !

wing conspiracy theories , attacking figures within the democratic party or perceived liberals , and demonstrating his fervent support for president trump by posting pro - trump memes and photographs of himself in attendance at trump rallies . <PARA> this set of facts prompted a \u201c <MASK> flag \u201d conspiracy theory which held that the mail -

pronged liberal conspiracy to damage the presidency and authority of donald trump : first by accusing him of an extramarital sexual relationship , and then by associating him with a campaign of terrorism by one of his supporters . <PARA> on 29 october , the conservative web site townhall reported on the \u201c ultra lounge \u201d link , asking : \u201c is all of this mere coincidence <MORE> and doorman at the strip club in the two months prior to his arrest in late october . this means he began working there at around the end of august 2018 . <PARA> on the other hand , stormy daniels was never employed at the ultra lounge but had worked there as a guest performer . according to the venue \u2019 s social media accounts , daniels performed just four shows at the ultra lounge , across only two days , 13 and 14 april 2018 \u2014 four and a half months before sayoc began working there . <PARA> so sayoc \u2019 s two months of employment at the ultra lounge did not overlap with the two days upon which daniels performed there . <PARA> beyond the fact that daniels performed at the ultra lounge four months before sayoc began working there , none of those <MASK> or speculating about a conspiracy involving sayoc and daniels have presented any other <MASK> that they knew each other , nor we were able to find any such <MASK> . <PARA> in order to <MASK> , based on the available <MASK> , that daniels and sayoc knew each other well enough to be engaged in what would be a high -

daniels \u201d conspiracy theory misses , in this respect , is that <MASK> improbability is not at all the same thing as implausibility . when one considers how many clubs stormy daniels performs at in a given year , one might even say her working the same club as sayoc ( at different times ) was more probable than implausible :",

( the situation was somewhat more complicated because wtvt was an affiliate of the fox television network and was also owned by fox , but the fox television network and the fox news channel are two distinctly different entities .) <PARA> the legal battle to which the <MASK> refers was about a husband - and - wife reporting team , jane aker and steve wilson , who in 1996 put together a <MASK> about the use of the monsanto - produced synthetic bovine growth hormone ( bgh ) posilac by florida dairy farmers . wtvt \u2019 s management asserted that the reporters \u2019 bgh piece was alarmist and one - sided and ordered the reporters to edit their <MASK> to produce a more \u201c balanced \u201d piece . aker and wilson defied those orders ; as a result , the bgh <MASK> never aired , and the pair were terminated by wtvt in 1997 . <PARA> the two reporters sued the <MASK> for breach of contract and retaliatory firing the following year , maintaining that they had been unfairly terminated from their jobs for \u201c resisting wtvt \u2019 s attempts to distort or suppress the bgh <MASK> \u201d at the behest of fox corporate and monsanto , and that the <MASK> \u2019 s management had fired them in retaliation over their threats to file a complaint about wtvt \u2019 s \u201c deliberate news distortion \u201d to the federal communications commission ( fcc ): <PARA> another common misconception is that fox news invoked first amendment protections in order to retain the \u201c right to lie \u201d during the lengthy legal battle between the couple and the florida fox affiliate . there was no mention of any such <MASK> in the appeals court decision , and akre herself does not corroborate it . ultimately , the fcc concluded in 2007 that the conflict between akre and wilson and the affiliate boiled down to an \u201c editorial dispute ... rather than a deliberate effort by [ wtvt ] to distort news .\u201d <PARA> the \u201c right to lie \u201d <MASK> are similar to another <MASK> <MASK> about fox news \u2019 trustworthiness , that the network was banned in canada because it does not meet stringent canadian broadcast standards for truthfulness .",

        "text": "the ongoing saga surrounding the controversial \u201c steele dossier \u201d ( or \u201c trump \u2013 russia dossier \u201d) saw a new development in december 2018 , when a judge \u2019 s order suggested that a former <MASK> department official and associate of the late republican u . s . senator john mccain of arizona may have been involved in providing parts of the dossier to a reporter from buzzfeed . <PARA> aleksej gubarov , former chairman and ceo of a company called xbt holdings , is suing buzzfeed in federal court , alleging defamation after the website published excerpts from an intelligence report compiled by former british intelligence official christopher steele . the research detailed alleged russian efforts to acquire compromising and scandalous information about then - presidential candidate donald trump , as well as alleged collusion between russia and individuals affiliated with the trump campaign , including the president \u2019 s former personal lawyer michael cohen . <PARA> both gubarov and xbt holdings were named in the report published by buzzfeed , prompting the lawsuit in the u . s . district court for the southern district of florida . <PARA> the \u201c steele dossier \u201d has long been regarded as controversial , especially since it was reported in october 2017 that the democratic national committee and the campaign of hillary clinton had partially funded the research that gave rise to the report . <PARA> before his death in august , mccain publicly disclosed the fact that he had acquired steele \u2019 s research in 2016 and personally provided it to then - fbi director james comey . <PARA> however on 19 december , u . s . district judge ursula ungaro averred in a court order that the dossier had come into the possession of a reporter from buzzfeed after a meeting with david kramer , an associate of mccain and a former deputy assistant secretary of <MASK> with responsibility for russia , ukraine , belarus , and moldova . <PARA> some supporters of president trump have targeted mccain for his involvement in promulgating the steele dossier , and judge ungaro \u2019 s affirmation that the dossier came into the possession of a reporter after a meeting with an associate of trump \u2019 s prompted further scrutiny and coverage from right - leaning sources in december 2018 . <PARA> against that background , reports emerged on 20 december that a high - profile advisor and spokesperson for president trump had publicly called on mccain to \u201c answer questions \u201d about his role in the dissemination of the steele dossier , despite his having died four months earlier . the huffington post reported , for example that : <PARA> the headline of the huffington post \u2018 s <MASK> read \u201c trump campaign aide appears to scold the late senator john mccain for his silence \u201d and the <MASK> asserted that pierson \u2019 s tweet had \u201c made it sound as if she were attempting to communicate with the dead <MORE> ridicule .\u201d likewise , newsweek reported under the headline \u201c trump 2020 adviser katrina pierson calls on john mccain to answer dossier questions ...\u201d that : <PARA> these <MASK> accurately reported the wording in pierson \u2019 s tweet , but their suggestions that she had sincerely demanded ( or even appeared to demand ) that the late arizona senator answer questions from his critics are off the mark and ignore a perfectly simple explanation for the phrasing in her tweet . <PARA> on 20 december , pierson did indeed tweet the following words : <PARA> it is therefore <MASK> that the body of her tweet contained the words \u201c john mccain still refuses to answer questions about his role in the dossier .\u201d however , this was also the headline of an <MASK> to which pierson linked in the same tweet , as clearly indicated by the fact that the initial letters of each of those words were capitalized in the style of a headline : <PARA> that <MASK> was published on pierson \u2019 s website on 2 november 2017 , when mccain was still alive . <PARA> so the explanation for the somewhat awkward phrasing in pierson \u2019 s tweet does not lie in her ignorance about the mccain \u2019 s passing , or in some sort of desire to communicate with the dead , but rather something far more reasonable and mundane . <PARA> if a reader wished to share pierson \u2019 s november 2017 <MASK> on twitter , one way of doing that would be to click the \u201c tweet \u201d button at the bottom of that page . this action automatically produces a window containing the draft of a tweet and a link to the <MASK> along with the headline of the <MASK> : \u201c john mccain still refuses to answer questions about his role in the dossier \u201d \u2014 as shown below : <PARA> that \u2019 s the exact same formulation of words that appeared in pierson \u2019 s widely - ridiculed tweet on 20 december , complete with capitalized first letters , in the style of a headline . in front of this headline , pierson appeared to have simply typed : \u201c since everyone is just now realizing his staffers role in the # russiahoax we have been asking questions !\u201d <PARA> so the mistake pierson made was not forgetting sen . john mccain had died in august or believing it might still be possible for him to respond to his critics from beyond the grave . rather , she failed to add punctuation to her tweet which would have more clearly separated the headline of the november 2017 <MASK> from her own december 2018 commentary . <PARA> the mistake others made was to spring into action with witty retorts and news <MASK> , apparently before considering that the actual explanation for pierson \u2019 s tweet was eminently reasonable rather than the result of any ignorance or supernatural beliefs on her part .",

        "text": "<MASK> : in january 2012 , attorney orly taitz represented plaintiffs who had filed a complaint with georgia secretary of <MASK> brian kemp , maintaining that barack obama should not appear on that <MASK> \u2019 s ballot as a presidential candidate as he is not eligible to hold the office of president of the united <MASK> . unlike previous attempts to have barack obama declared ineligible for the presidency , in this case the plaintiffs did not <MASK> that barack obama was ineligible because he was born outside the united <MASK> ; instead , they stipulated he was born in hawaii but argued that an 1875 supreme court ruling ( minor v . happersett ) defined \u201c natural born citizens \u201d as people born in the united <MASK> to parents who are both u . s . citizens , and since barack obama \u2019 s father was not an american citizen , barack obama himself does not qualify for that <MASK> , which is a constitutional requirement for the presidency : <PARA> the matter before this court has nothing to do with the birth place of the defendant , nor does it assert that he is not a citizen of the united <MASK> . in fact , limited to this challenged primary election , the plaintiff will stipulate that the defendant was born in hawaii , that the defendant is a u . s . citizen , and that the defendant was constitutionally - qualified to serve as a u . s . senator . the plaintiff makes no assertion regarding the defendant \u2019 s passports , or social security number , or any other fact related to the defendant , other than the one fact asserted at the beginning of this opposition : that the defendant \u2019 s father was not a u . s . citizen . <PARA> since georgia <MASK> law stipulates that if a candidate \u2019 s qualifications are challenged the secretary of <MASK> must request a hearing on the matter before an administrative law judge , the issue was referred to georgia deputy chief judge michael malihi in the office of <MASK> administrative hearings . judge malihi denied a motion by barack obama \u2019 s attorneys to dismiss the complaint and scheduled a hearing for 26 january 2012 . <PARA> the plaintiffs presented their case at that hearing , which both barack obama and his legal team declined to attend . ( although judge malihi had denied a motion to quash a subpoena for president obama to appear at the hearing , obama \u2019 s legal team argued that no president should be compelled to attend a court hearing , and the president instead spent the day unveiling new energy initiatives in las vegas .) <PARA> judge malihi offered no verdict regarding the case , as his role was only to gather facts and make a recommendation ; the official decision on whether barack obama will be listed on the georgia ballot rests with secretary <MORE> records , forged documents and document manipulation and \u201c none ... provided persuasive testimony ,\u201d malihi wrote . <PARA> addressing the other <MASK> that contends obama cannot be a candidate because his father was never a u . s . citizen , malihi said he was persuaded by a 2009 ruling by the indiana court of appeals decision that struck down a similar challenge . in that ruling , the indiana court found that children born within the u . s . are natural - born citizens , regardless of the citizenry of their parents . <PARA> the findings by malihi , a judge for the <MASK> office of administrative hearings , go to secretary of <MASK> brian kemp , who will make the final determination . <PARA> with regard to the challenge that obama does not have legitimate birth and identification papers , malihi said he found the <MASK> \u201c unsatisfactory \u201d and \u201c insufficient to support plaintiffs \u2019 allegations .\u201d <PARA> a number of the witnesses who testified about the alleged fraud were never qualified as experts in birth records , forged documents and document manipulation and \u201c none ... provided persuasive testimony ,\u201d malihi wrote . <PARA> addressing the other <MASK> that contends obama cannot be a candidate because his father was never a u . s . citizen , malihi said he was persuaded by a 2009 ruling by the indiana court of appeals decision that struck down a similar challenge . in that ruling , the indiana court found that children born within the u . s . are natural - born citizens , regardless of the citizenry of their parents . <PARA> on 7 february 2012 , georgia secretary of <MASK> brian kemp issued a final decision <MASK> that barack obama was qualified to remain on georgia \u2019 s ballot as a presidential candidate : <PARA> georgia secretary of <MASK> brian kemp issued his final decision on challenges contending that president barack obama does not meet the <MASK> of georgia \u2019 s eligibility requirements for his name to be listed on the 2012 presidential preference primary ballot . <PARA> secretary kemp <MASK> , \u201c after careful consideration of administrative law judge michael malihi \u2019 s initial decision and all record <MASK> based on the criteria set forth in this process , i find that the respondent , president barack obama , meets the <MASK> of georgia \u2019 s eligibility requirements . president barack obama \u2019 s name shall remain on the democratic party \u2019 s 2012 presidential preference primary ballot .\u201d <PARA> secretary kemp <MASK> , \u201c after careful consideration of administrative law judge michael malihi \u2019 s initial decision and all record <MASK> based on the criteria set forth in this process , i find that the respondent , president barack obama , meets the <MASK> of georgia \u2019 s eligibility requirements . president barack obama \u2019 s name shall remain on the democratic party \u2019 s 2012 presidential preference primary ballot .\u201d",

it sounded like a diesel engine revving and smelled worse . to keep himself from gagging , he tried fanning his arms a while , hoping the smell would dissipate . things had just about returned to normal when he felt another urge coming . he shifted his weight to his other leg and let go . this was a real blue ribbon winner ; the windows shook , the dishes on the table rattled and a minute later the flowers on the table were dead . while keeping an ear tuned in on the conversation in the hallway , and keeping his promise of staying blindfolded , he carried on like this for the next 10 minutes , farting and then fanning each time with his napkin . <PARA> when he heard the phone farewells ( indicating the end of his loneliness and freedom ) he neatly laid his napkin on his lap and folded his hands on top of it . smiling contentedly , he was the picture of innocence when his wife walked in . apologising for taking so long , she asked if he had peeked at the dinner table . after assuring her he had not peeked , she removed the blindfold and yelled \u201c surprise !\u201d <PARA> to his shock and horror , there were twelve dinner guests seated around the table . <PARA> as wonderful as this tale is , it \u2019 s clearly more fiction than truth . even blindfolded , the fellow would have been sure to pick up on the presence of twelve dinner guests ; people do shift around in their seats , after all . <PARA> barbara \u201c blast from the past \u201d mikkelson <PARA> sightings : the \u201c fart in the car \u201d legend forms the plot of the 1997 comedy short the date and was the basis for a memorable 1998 television ad for smart beep . a version of the \u201c fart at the dinner party \u201d tale shows up in the 1940 carson mccullers novel the heart is a lonely hunter and is performed by sheriff brock on an episode of television \u2019 s picket fences .",

prompted optical illusion makes red cars appear to be going faster than they actually are and so works to get them clocked more often by john law . color - influenced driver behavior has also been suggested , with the rubious shade of such vehicles working to increase their drivers \u2019 breathing and heart rates , which in turn incites those behind the wheel to drive faster without their consciously being aware of having made that decision . another line of reasoning ties assumptions made about sports cars ( that people who own them tend to drive fast ) to red \u2019 s being one of the most popular colors for such vehicles \u2014 if sports cars are ticketed more often , and more sports cars tend to be red , then red cars would earn proportionally more speeding tickets than would vehicles of other <PARA> colors . <PARA> they \u2019 re great theories , one and all . problem is , their premise is flawed as it does not appear that red cars get cited for speeding more often than they <MASK> should . <PARA> whenever they \u2019 ve been asked about the <MASK> , police across the u . s . have consistently denied any connection between vehicle color and tickets issued or the allegation that they write up the drivers of red cars more often than they do other motorists . said sgt . thornnie rouse , a trooper with the maryland <MASK> police for more than 20 years : \u201c you don \u2019 t care about the car \u2019 s color , you care about the violation . if a red car and a green car drive past you and the green car is going 30 mph over the speed limit , the driver of the green car is the one who is going to get stopped .\u201d similarly , sgt . thomas miller of clearwater , florida \u2019 s traffic enforcement unit said , \u201c it \u2019 s not the color of the car that matters <MORE> moody and expensive , earning seven points makes them the top target . <PARA> 3 ) it \u2019 s probably not a good idea to drive pink cars either . not only are they high scorers , but the chances of looking sleek , stylish , moody or expensive are slim . <PARA> 4 ) if you don \u2019 t have a red car , you should still be wary . driving behind them could make you liable for a swift one -

        "text": "friends - <PARA> i am sending this email to the majority of my address book \u2013 please pass this one on . it is so important ! <PARA> we were in seaside , florida , 2 weeks ago and decided to allow our children to get \u201c henna tattoos \u201d \u2013 the adults decided to indulge , as well . this was done at a very nice , \u201c high - end \u201d place \u2013 next to $ 2 \u2013 3 million dollar homes . i asked if it was \u201c safe \u201d for children and was assured that it was a \u201c natural \u201d dye with no consequence . <PARA> 10 days later , my 7 yr . old and my 5 yr . old are having \u201c severe \u201d allergic reactions to the \u201c black henna \u201d. their tattoos will now , most likely , be permanent scars . they are reacting to ppd \u2013 a substance added to natural henna to make it more \u201c black \u201d and allow it to set more quickly . <PARA> now that my girls have been exposed to ppd \u2013 they can never have their hair dyed \u2013 as it could be fatal . they can not ever use paba \u2013 based sunscreens , they can not have \u201c sulfa \u201d anti - biotics , they can not use most cosmetics , and they can not have most drugs ending in \u201c- caine \u201d. our first visit is to the dermatologist tomorrow and then to the allergist to determine the life long consequences of this exposure . <PARA> please do not allow your children to get these \u201c all natural henna tattoos \u201d unless you are 100 % sure they are pure henna ( which has a much lower rate of allergic reaction ). make sure they do not contain ppd ! it can be a life altering decision . <PARA> take care , <PARA> <MASK> : while we can \u2019 t yet confirm this particular <MASK> about the two tots permanently scarred by temporary henna tattoos applied in seaside , florida , the risks decried in the account are at least somewhat real . <PARA> for thousands of years , people have relied on henna , an old world tropical shrub of the loosestrife family , to color their hair and decorate their skin . pure henna is green but <PARA> dries to a dark brown or orange hue . to create body art ( also known as mehndi ), henna is mixed into a paste with essential oils and applied to the skin in intricate patterns . when left on the skin for at least four hours , the paste produces patterns that last up to just over three weeks . <PARA> temporary tattoos worked in pure henna are generally safe . ( it is extremely rare to develop an allergic reaction to pure henna .) however , those executed in \u201c black henna \u201d are not always so <MORE> make delicate skin erupt into blistering redness that sometimes leads to permanent scarring . the reaction can also spread , causing grotesque full - body swelling , itching , and skin sloughing . <PARA> black henna is not always safe to use . permanent scarring can result from its application , and a tattoo meant to be worn for a few days can become a lifelong mark . also , someone who has had a bad reaction to black henna may afterwards become extra - sensitive to ppd and similar chemicals , including some antibiotics and local anesthetics . future reactions will likely be more severe . <PARA> even when there isn \u2019 t an immediate bad reaction to a tattoo worked in black henna , just having had that form of skin art can set up the wearer for misery in the future . thanks to the concentration of ppd in the formulation used to execute skin designs ( up to 15 . 7 %), the temporary tattoo sensitizes its wearer to that chemical . more than two - thirds of hair dyes currently contain ppd or related chemicals , which means the former tattoo wearer may well experience a delayed hypersensitivity reaction when she decides years later to change her hair color . said reaction can range anywhere from redness and irritation around the hairline and scalp to complete swelling of the face and a rash all over the body . <PARA> in 2006 , the american contact dermatitis society named ppd its \u201c allergen of the year .\u201d <PARA> the food and drug administration ( fda ) has this to say about temporary or henna tattoos : <PARA> since henna typically produces a brown , orange - brown , or reddish - brown tint , other ingredients must be added to produce other colors , such as those marketed as \u201c black henna \u201d and \u201c blue henna .\u201d so - called \u201c black henna \u201d may contain the \u201c coal tar \u201d color p - phenylenediamine , also known as ppd . this ingredient may cause allergic reactions in some individuals . the only legal use of ppd in cosmetics is as a hair dye . it is not approved for direct application to the skin . even brown shades of products marketed as henna may contain other ingredients intended to make them darker or make the stain last longer . <PARA> in addition to color additives , these skin - decorating products may contain other ingredients , such as solvents . <PARA> in addition to color additives , these skin - decorating products may contain other ingredients , such as solvents . <PARA> in 2002 , north wildwood , on an island off the new jersey shore , joined neighboring oceanfront resort wildwood in banning henna tattoos because it found it impossible to determine which contained fda - approved dyes and which didn \u2019 t . <PARA> barbara \u201c banned on the run \u201d mikkelson",

        "text": "j . edgar hoover served as director of the bureau between 1924 ( then the bureau of investigation , renamed the federal bureau of investigation in 1935 ) and his death in 1972 . even after all these years and the numerous biographies written about this enigmatic man , he remains a contradictory mystery to the american public , with his sexual orientation and stance towards african - americans subjects still open to hot debate . to many , hoover was a lawman of the highest order , dedicated to bringing wrongdoers to justice and keeping america strong . to just as many , he represented all that was wrong with a system that entrusted too much power in the hands of one man . they saw him as a tyrant who rode roughshod over individuals \u2019 rights and freedoms in the name of safeguarding the country . <PARA> what there is little debate about , however , are the numerous petty abuses he unthinkingly subjected subordinates to . hoover ruled with an iron fist and was seldom questioned even when his way of doing things was suspect . he viewed the department as his and everyone in it as there to do his bidding , and he often failed to separate his away - from - the - office needs with his requirements as director of the fbi . bureau personnel were routinely used to write his speeches , run his errands , and even fill out his personal income tax returns . his private concerns became departmental concerns as hoover regarded the department as an extension of himself . <PARA> one incident in particular highlights this attitude : upon going on a diet to battle his own bulge , he issued a bureau - wide directive that henceforth agents would conform to the suggested weight standards of the metropolitan life insurance company or else . a round of crash diets quickly followed , with every overweight agent in the field offices and at headquarters hastily shedding extra pounds they \u2019 d accumulated ... everyone but hoover , that is , who despite his diet remained at the same weight as before . <PARA> hoover was famous for penning instructions and comments in distinctive blue ink in the margins of fbi memos , then routing them back to the sender for action . perhaps it was this habit which fueled his insistence that all memos have generous white space left around their text \u2014 he needed a place to scrawl his notes after all , and in hoover \u2019 s mind his needs were the department \u2019 s needs . <PARA> that insistence of hoover \u2019 s led to a legend about a misunderstanding it allegedly created , with rather outsized consequences : <PARA> cartha deloach was hoover \u2019 s assistant from 1965 to 1970 , making him the # 3 man in the bureau at that time . he recalled the \u201c borders \u201d incident thusly : <PARA> through the magic of retelling , a few phone calls made to see if something was up with america \u2019 s northern and southern neighbors was transformed into coveys of g - men being sent scurrying to defend the nation \u2019 s shared borders . <PARA> is any of this <MASK> <MASK> , though ? it \u2019 s a great tale to get across the image of hoover as the tenaciously autocratic bureau head so feared that even his most trusted lieutenants dared not question any command he issued , not even to clear up a potential misunderstanding , but whether it \u2019 s a real account of an actual incident or simply a concocted anecdote may forever remain as much a mystery as hoover himself .",

        "text": "for several decades now , a list purportedly outlining \u201c communist rules for revolution \u201d has been trotted out as <MASK> that the current political climate is sending us all on a road to ruin : <PARA> a time - honored ploy in the political arena has been to discredit your opponents ( and their ideas ) by demonizing them , through associating them with ... well , demons . in the modern era , this has usually meant <MASK> the ideas your opponents advocate were implemented by nazis or communists , or were recognized by them as means of \u201c softening up \u201d a country and making it ripe for totalitarian takeover . so , for example , if you believe the film industry should be more heavily regulated to prevent it from corrupting our youth , simply reference a supposed historical document in which communists <MASK> they were able to seize power in russia because the previous government had allowed callow youth to idle away their time watching \u201c immoral movies ,\u201d and your point is irrefutably made . <PARA> as reproduced in the example above , one purportedly genuine document of such ilk is a list of \u201c communist rules for revolution \u201d which is typically <MASK> to have been discovered \u201c in may 1919 at dusseldorf , germany , by allied forces \u201d and \u201c first printed in the united <MASK> \u201d in the bartlesville , oklahoma examiner - enterprise . aside from the fact that the examiner - enterprise is a real newspaper , none of this rings <MASK> . language about getting the young \u201c interested in sex \u201d and focusing their attention on \u201c sexy books \u201d and fretting about the \u201c registration of all firearms \u201d sounds out of place for 1919 ( as this ngram chart shows , \u201c sexy \u201d is a word one was far more likely to have encountered in america during the post - world war ii era than in 1919 ), and not surprisingly , nobody has ever managed to turn up the mysterious issue of examiner - enterprise that supposedly printed this list . <PARA> when columnist bob greene checked out the \u201c communist rules for revolution \u201d with russian specialists at the university of chicago and northwestern university in the mid - 1980s , they said the list was \u201c a total fraud ,\u201d \u201c an obvious fabrication ,\u201d and \u201c an implausible concoction of american fears and phobias .\u201d greene also observed : \u201c i always wanted to meet a communist who was carrying the list around , so i could ask him what \u2018 obloquy \u2019 means .\u201d <PARA> when the new york times ran an <MASK> on the \u201c communist rules for revolution \u201d back in 1970 , it had already been circulating for about twenty - five years . the times reported that neither the national archives , the library of congress , nor university libraries had a copy of any such document . when montana senator lee metcalf looked into the issue back then , he checked with the fbi , cia , and the senate internal security subcommittee ; he found that \u201c exhaustive research \u201d had proved the rules to be \u201c completely spurious ,\u201d and he declared that \u201c the extreme right also follows rules , one of which is to make maximum use of <MASK> , misleading and fear - inspiring <MASK> .\u201d <PARA> nonetheless , numerous members of congress have received copies of the communist \u201c rules \u201d list from alarmed constituents over the years and , believing that nobody else was yet aware of them , have inserted them into the congressional record . this list has also been reproduced in many newspaper columns and letters to the editor . <PARA> the earliest known publication of these \u201c communist rules for revolution \u201d dates from february 1946 , and it \u2019 s significant to note that publication coincided with events such as winston churchill \u2019 s famous \u201c iron curtain \u201d speech , in which he issued a warning to citizens of the united <MASK> that \u201c communist parties constitute a growing challenge and peril to christian civilization .\u201d the timing suggests it \u2019 s far more likely this list was compiled by americans in 1946 than by russians in 1919 . <PARA> circulation of this list really took off during the height of the cold war in 1954 , the same year that a military defeat by viet minh communists forced the french out of indochina , and senator joseph mccarthy charged that communists had infiltrated the cia and the atomic weapons industry . that year was when florida <MASK> attorney george a . brautigam endorsed the document as genuine , and for many years afterward , printed versions of the list included brautigam \u2019 s <MASK> of its authenticity and reproduced his signature at the bottom . <PARA> even though the soviet union has long since ceased to be , and the number of communist countries remaining in the world can be counted on the fingers of one hand , the \u201c communist rules for revolution \u201d are still anachronistically cited as <MASK> that america is experiencing moral and political decay fostered by outside forces . as folklorist jan harold brunvand wrote of this piece back in 1986 :",

        "text": "the following item was the text of an <MASK> titled \u201c boy \u2019 s death highlights a hidden danger : dry drowning \u201d that was posted to the todayshow . com site on 5 june 2008 and circulated widely online : <PARA> although the account is essentially <MASK> , the <MASK> contains some confusing elements that could send parents scuttling to protect their children from one danger when they should be trying to guard them against a quite different one . <PARA> a 10 - year - old boy named johnny (\u201c jon jon \u201d) jackson died as described above on 1 june 2008 in goose creek , south carolina , subsequent to swimming in the pool at the apartment complex where he lived . although johnny , a child who lived with autism and attention deficit disorder , was wearing flotation devices on his arms and was being monitored by his mother during his time in the pool , he did inhale some water while swimming ; his mother described him as \u201c taking a little bit of water in and coughing and then calming down .\u201d he afterwards appeared fine , but less than two hours after leaving the pool he twice defecated in his pants and complained of being tired . after being bathed and dressing himself back at the apartment , the boy walked to his bed unaided , leaving his mother to believe he was simply worn out . yet when his mother checked on johnny a few minutes later , she discovered that white foam was issuing from his mouth , his lips were blue , and his tongue was sticking out . the family called 911 , but the johnny suffered cardiac arrest during transport to the hospital and was pronounced dead on arrival at trident medical center . according to the coroner , water was found in johnny \u2019 s lungs , and the cause of his death was listed as asphyxiation by drowning . <PARA> while the <MASK> about johnny \u2019 s death is factual , it contains one key element of confusion : jon jon jackson was not technically a \u201c dry drowning \u201d victim , but rather a victim of \u201c delayed drowning ,\u201d also termed \u201c secondary drowning .\u201d that distinction is important because numerous news <MASK> that mentioned johnny \u2019 s death and attributed it to dry drowning also supplied the information that dry drowning is responsible for ten to fifteen percent of all drowning deaths , thereby making it seem as though the tragic circumstances that swept away this one particular child loom as a huge risk to other children . this is not the case : the incidence of delayed drowning ( which is what killed johnny ) is relatively uncommon ; the incidence of <MASK> dry drowning is much greater . the latter is therefore what adult swimmers and the parents of juvenile swimmers need be more concerned about , but that form of <MORE> , so the victim dies of asphyxiation . the second explanation posits that the shock of a swimmer \u2019 s suddenly entering extremely cold water causes the heart to stop . <PARA> dry drowning accounts for ten to fifteen percent of all drowning deaths . considering that approximately 4 , 000 people drown in the u . s . each year , that means dry drowning kills about 400 to 600 u . s . victims annually . it therefore poses a significant enough mortality risk that those who swim ( or who supervise swimmers ) should know what can be done to decrease the chance of its happening to them or their loved ones . <PARA> to help prevent dry drowning , keep your mouth closed when jumping or diving into water , thereby protecting the larynx from a sudden inrush of water that could cause it to spasm and cut off the airway . also , do not dive or jump into extremely cold water ; instead enter cold water gradually . those who have a <MASK> of heart problems should avoid entering very cold water at all , even if they plan to go slowly . <PARA> drowning is the second most common cause of death in children in the united <MASK> . in addition to following the more usual cautions ( e . g ., watch them like hawks all the time ), caregivers of young swimmers should try to head off dry drowning by training their charges to keep their mouths closed when jumping into water and to enter very cold water slowly . caregivers should also guard against delayed drowning by monitoring very closely any child who has come out of the water coughing and sputtering ( signs of water having been breathed in ), especially keeping an eye out for any further difficulties in breathing , extreme tiredness , or marked changes in behavior , all of which are signs that a swimmer may have inhaled a dangerous amount of fluid . should such difficulties be noted in a swimmer , that person should be taken promptly to an emergency room for medical observation and , if necessary , intervention . <PARA> one additional caution should be noted regarding drowning : it is a fallacy that those who lose their lives in such fashion will flail about wildly even as they are slipping beneath the water \u2019 s surface . drowning generally occurs silently and smoothly , the victim quietly passing away wholly unnoticed as friends or family chatter nearby . therefore , never mistake a lack of commotion for a sign that everything is all right ; instead , keep your eyes on those you are supposed to be watching rather than trust that they will do or shout something to alert you if anything goes awry . forget about trusting that old saw about drowners \u2019 going down three times : they go down once , and they stay down .",

fbi agent john guandolo . guandolo resigned from his position with the bureau in december 2008 after he was caught engaging in a sexual relationship with a key confidential source in the midst of a corruption investigation of a louisiana politician . since then , he has created a burgeoning second career training law enforcement groups to identify potential covert islamic threats to the united <MASK> . <PARA> however , guandolo \u2019 s credibility in this area has been questioned , one example being an npr segment that primarily focused on jordanian - american omar al - omari . guandolo was central to the segment due his insinuation during a law enforcement training course that omari was connected to a vague cabal of \u201c terrorists \u201d: <PARA> guandolo remains the sole source we \u2019 ve found for this <MASK> about john brennan \u2019 s being a muslim , with no versions of it tracing back to any source other than him . the only thing approaching <MASK> the former fbi agent had cited in support of his <MASK> is the fact that brennan once said during a speech that he had \u201c marveled at the majesty of the hajj .\u201d since the hajj <MORE> without having participated in it : <PARA> guandolo \u2019 s <MASK> is not only unfounded but problematic . even if guandolo \u2019 s demonstrated inclination to make <MASK> without factual basis were not considered , his <MASK> constitute a conflict of interest due to his post - fbi career : guandolo markets the idea of an imminent , pervasive threat to security in the united <MASK> has resulted from a conspiracy by muslims to infiltrate the government at its highest levels and is paid for his \u201c expertise \u201d through his being hired to provide lectures and training classes on the subject . <PARA> aside from guandolo \u2019 s shaky accusation , the one other scanty piece of <MASK> cited in support of this <MASK> is that the movie zero dark thirty , about the u . s . intelligence and military operation to track down and kill osama bin laden in pakistan , featured a top - level cia character known as \u201c the wolf \u201d who was depicted in the film as a practicing muslim and shown praying in his office . some who have heard the <MASK> about brennan have speculated this character was intended to represent him , but the personal details of the real - life man on whom the character was based ( known only as \u201c roger \u201d) aren \u2019 t a match for brennan . and brennan , who at the time was the white house counterterrorism adviser , was represented in the film by a composite character known only as \u201c national security advisor ,\u201d portrayed by a different actor than the one who filled the \u201c wolf \u201d role . <PARA> while it is <MASK> that john brennan was sworn into office using a copy of the u . s . constitution rather than a bible , that fact alone is not definitive <MASK> of any particular religious sentiment . had he sought to conceal his islamic faith , it \u2019 s just as likely he would have opted to use a bible ( particularly if he had no intent to uphold the very constitution on which he swore his oath ). and if we are to believe that john brennan is a closeted muslim , then we would also have to believe that either no one in the highest levels of the u . s . government has the least bit of concern about that fact ( not enough to speak up about it , anyway ), or that brennan has managed to successfully hide his religious beliefs from the entirety of the vast intelligence network that he heads . the more logical answer is that john brennan could very well have no faith at all , or that he holds the ideals of the constitution higher than the ideals of religion in relation to his duties as head of the cia . <PARA> in january 2017 , john brennan was succeeded as cia director by mike pompeo .",

        "text": "<MASK> : in the 18th century , mercury salts were used to make felt for fancy hats . the process required copious amounts of the element , a substance then not understood to be as dangerous as we now know it to be . <PARA> hat makers who day after day handled mercury - soaked fabric risked mercury poisoning , a condition that affects the nervous systems . those so exposed would in time develop uncontrollable twitches and trembles , making them appear demented to the casual observer . <PARA> even though there exists a strong tie between mercury poisoning and strange behavior in those long - ago hatters , it \u2019 s still more than likely the term we now toss about so casually did <PARA> not spring from this combination . phrases such as mad as a march hare , mad as a buck , mad as maybutter , and mad as a wet hen are older than mad as a hatter , leaving open the conclusion that hatter is but a variation of an existing term . ( interestingly , these other phrases pull in different directions , with mad as a march hare signifying odd or eccentric behavior , while mad as a wet hen characterizing anger .) <PARA> whatever the definitive <MASK> of mad as a hatter , we know the term wasn \u2019 t coined by lewis carroll in his 1865 alice \u2019 s adventures in wonderland . the saying turns up in thackeray \u2019 s 1849 pendennis and thomas chandler haliburton \u2019 s 1837 the clockmaker . <PARA> carroll \u2019 s \u201c hatter \u201d might well have been modeled on theophilus carter , an eccentric furniture dealer who characteristically sported a top hat . carter was neither a hat maker nor had been exposed through his work to mercury fumes \u2014 if he had indeed been carroll \u2019 s inspiration for the \u201c mad hatter \u201d of alice , it would have been because he was a somewhat nutty real - life character much given to the wearing of highly noticeable hats . there also exists a possibility carroll was unaware of the mercury connection to the existing saying . it \u2019 s also possible he had not previously encountered the saying and thus thought he had coined it himself . <PARA> carroll \u2019 s alice is replete with word play . he loved to twist words , and encoding double and triple meanings into his work was for him part of the fun . his mad hatter could therefore be a caricature of theophilus carter , a real person of his acquaintance , while his mad as a hatter could have been a twist on the pre - existing saying , mad as a march hare . those familiar with alice will recall that the march hare was the constant companion of the mad hatter . <PARA> moreover , mad at that time had more than a few meanings : \u201c off the rocker \u201d and \u201c angry ,\u201d but also \u201c venomous ,\u201d which suggests yet another twist in the game . according to a dictionary of common fallacies : <PARA> lewis carroll with his penchant for linguistic games presumably knew perfectly well that his \u201c mad hatter \u2019 meant \u2018 a venomous adder \u2019, but since his readers may have been misled by tenniel \u2019 s drawings , it should be pointed out that \u2018 mad \u2019 meant \u2018 venomous \u2019 and \u2018 hatter \u2019 is a corruption of \u2018 adder \u2019, or viper , so that the phrase \u2018 mad as an atter \u2019 <MASK> meant \u2018 as venomous as a viper \u2019. <PARA> supporting the \u201c adder \u201d theory comes this entry from an 1882 phrase <MASK> book : <PARA> in the anglo - saxon the word \u2018 mad \u2019 was used as a synonym for violent , furious , angry , or venomous . in some parts of england and in the united <MASK> particularly , it is still used in this sense . atter was the anglo - saxon name for an adder , or viper . the proverbial saying has therefore probably no reference to hat - makers , but merely means \u2018 as venomous as an adder .\u2019 the germans call the viper natter . <PARA> as does this 1895 entry from beckwith \u2019 s almanac , which cites the brooklyn eagle as its source : <PARA> the phrase \u201c mad as a hatter \u201d has no reference to that respectable artist who designs the crowning <MASK> of civilized male attire , but relates back to the anglo - saxon word \u201c atter \u201d ( an adder or viper ). \u201c mad \u201d was formerly used as a synonym for violent or venomous and is still used in that sense in some parts of england as well as in this country . the phrase , therefore , strictly means as \u201c venomous as a viper ,\u201d the old form , \u201c mad as an atter ,\u201d having been corrupted to \u201c mad as a hatter .\u201d <PARA> a sharp - eyed reader spotted this very early sighting of \u201c mad as an adder \u201d in an 1842 publication : <PARA> he was as mad as a striped adder . <PARA> whether carroll meant his \u201c hatter \u201d as a caricature of a known crackpot , a play on mad as a march hare , as a bit of tomfoolery about venomous vipers , or as a combination of all three , it seems clear that the only relation his use of the term had to mercury - maddened hat makers was that of coincidence . <PARA> barbara \u201c mercury rising \u201d mikkelson",

        "text": "<MASK> warnings about hackers invading facebook accounts have been shared since at least 2011 . some of them involve insulting messages that are purportedly posted to the walls of friends of the rightful owners of those accounts . the copy - and - paste text appears in varying forms in emails and social media posts . for example , this variation from 2021 <MASK> that a \u201c new hack on facebook \u201d aimed to \u201c hurt and offend \u201d friends : <PARA> a similar warning was issued in 2015 : <PARA> facebook accounts can be retooled by hackers to issue missives their actual owners would never send . the posting of derogatory notes on friends \u2019 walls is one example . however , the mechanism whereby malcontents gain such control is one of social engineering rather than computer wizardry . there is no special programming trick the ill - intentioned master that allows them to seize control of social media accounts . further , there is no way for a \u201c new hack on facebook \u201d to randomly access personal accounts to use them to send insulting and / or sexual messages in others \u2019 names . ( so - called facebook \u201c pirates \u201d might have been able to achieve a similar effect . however , they did so by creating new accounts that impersonate existing accounts , not by \u201c hacking \u201d into the latter .) <PARA> instead , it comes down to a matter of tricking the unsuspecting into unlocking the door through which invaders gain the access they seek . <PARA> those who lose control of their accounts do so through unintentionally installing rogue facebook applications . others fall victim to clickjacking schemes when they click on proffered links misleadingly labeled as innocuous or alluring items . fake \u201c like \u201d buttons or links to videos that sound interesting are examples . <PARA> another way that some facebook users are duped involves the execution of malicious javascript code in their browsers \u2019 address bar . this is the case in the november 2011 facebook porn video attacks , described in further detail on our page . some even fall prey to phishing schemes . <PARA> in sum , security - conscious users need not worry about a \u201c new hack on facebook \u201d that might hurt , offend , or insult friends . \u201c hackers \u201d will not suddenly seize control of facebook accounts . in order for an account to be \u201c hacked ,\u201d users would have to actively do something to open the door and allow hijackers to access their accounts .",

        "text": "<MASK> : we first encountered this photograph of two young men smiling and flipping off the camera while cruelly holding a puppy suspended by a wire around its neck when it exploded across the internet in october 2010 . this photograph has continued to circulate widely ever since , usually accompanied by text entreating viewers to help identify the youths pictured and turn them in to authorities . <PARA> according to news reports from october 2010 , this picture triggered an investigation in malaysia after being spread via the twitter account of an actress : <PARA> malaysian police said they had launched an investigation after pictures of a puppy apparently being tortured appeared on micro - blogging website twitter . <PARA> \u201c we are looking into the report filed by several animal lovers regarding a dog being abused in a photo on an internet website ,\u201d a malaysian police official , who declined to be identified , said . <PARA> \u201c investigations are being carried out but we cannot release any other details so far ,\u201d he added . <PARA> malaysian animal rights society president n surendren said he and five other civil society groups filed a police report over the photograph , which he said appeared on the twitter page of a popular malaysian actress . <PARA> \u201c the photo on twitter shows two men in the process of hanging a small black and white puppy and both men are showing an obscene gesture while posing with the puppy , which is hanging by its neck ,\u201d he said . <PARA> \u201c it is quite outrageous because the fact that they allowed the photo to be taken meant they felt they could get away with it and the police wouldn \u2019 t take action ,\u201d he added . <PARA> surendran said the photograph came to the society \u2019 s attention when it was mailed to them from a person who had seen it on the actress \u2019 twitter account . <PARA> \u201c we are looking into the report filed by several animal lovers regarding a dog being abused in a photo on an internet website ,\u201d a malaysian police official , who declined to be identified , said . <PARA> \u201c investigations are being carried out but we cannot release any other details so far ,\u201d he added . <PARA> malaysian animal rights society president n surendren said he and five other civil society groups filed a police report over the photograph , which he said appeared on the twitter page of a popular malaysian actress . <PARA> \u201c the photo on twitter shows two men in the process of hanging a small black and white puppy and both men are showing an obscene gesture while posing with the puppy , which is hanging by its neck ,\u201d he said . <PARA> \u201c it is quite outrageous because the fact that they allowed the photo to be taken meant they felt they could get away with it and the <MORE> the malay mail she re - tweeted the photo on her account but did not know the persons in the picture . <PARA> \u201c my intentions were to highlight the cruelty towards animals portrayed by the two individuals . i am strongly against animal cruelty .\u201d <PARA> society for the prevention of cruelty to animals selangor said they were doing their best to uncover the identity of the individuals in the photo . <PARA> \u201c it is not easy as it came from an online source . we are doing what we can and hope the public will be patient .\u201d <PARA> in june 2009 , four teenagers from tepic in the mexican <MASK> of nayarit took pictures and video of themselves torturing and killing a stray dog and posted the results <PARA> on the internet under the title \u201c muerte de callejerito \u201d (\u201c death of little street dog \u201d). those youths were subsequently taken into custody and , according to <PARA> humane society international , they were expelled from school , required to participate in psychological treatment and community service , and pay a fine of 400 pesos . in august 2010 , a facebook group called \u201c dile si al maltrato \u201d (\u201c say yes to abuse \u201d) was created which featured graphic pictures of animal abuse culled from various sources , and that short - lived group included pictures taken by the tepic teenagers as well as the photograph of the hanging puppy shown at the head of this page . that commonality has led many sources to link the hanging puppy photo to the mexican youths responsible for the \u201c muerte de callejerito \u201d images , but there appears to be no real connection between the two , as none of the mexican teenagers ( shown in an april 2010 television interview ) resembles either of the young men pictured in the hanging puppy photo . <PARA> additionally , the hanging puppy photo was posted to a portuguese - language blog back in october 2008 , which means it well antedates the exploits of the tepic teenagers responsible for the \u201c muerte de callejerito \u201d images . <PARA> some viewers have maintained that the <MASK> hanging puppy photo was digitally manipulated or staged , but it was posted to the internet along with other pictures showing a dead , mutilated puppy of similar appearance , so there appears to be little doubt about the fate of the poor young dog . <PARA> for now the details of this photograph remain a mystery to us : when this picture was taken , where it was taken , the identities of the two young men shown in the photo , and whether they were ever caught and punished are all unknown . given that the case is now nearly four years old ( or more ), it seems unlikely at this remove that the culprits will be identified and punished if that has not already happened .",

( we reached out to the star \u2018 s reporters for clarification but had not heard back by press time .) <PARA> certainly the use of bracelets and / or wristbands is not part of a new policy just enacted by the trump administration , nor something that otherwise has \u201c just begun .\u201d immigration authorities have for years used wristbands to identify immigrants scheduled for summary criminal prosecution for illegal border - crossing under a federal initiative known as operation streamline , which was created under the administration of george w . bush in 2005 and continued during the obama and trump administrations . <PARA> operation streamline was launched in 2005 by michael chertoff , then the secretary of the department of homeland security ( dhs ). according to the dhs , the u . s . border patrol piloted the initiative \u201c in response to an increase in illegal alien entries from countries other than mexico in 2004 and 2005 \u201d and intended it to \u201c reduce the rate of alien re - entry recidivism .\u201d <PARA> traditionally , the approach to foreign nationals crossing the u . s . border illegally from mexico had been to stop them and send them back over the border into mexico ( an approach known as \u201c catch and release \u201d) or to detain them and then formally deport them . <PARA> under operations streamline , such persons were to be rounded up to undergo criminal prosecution in united <MASK> district courts , serve jail sentences ( usually under one year ), and then be deported . the initiative was jointly run by the department of homeland security ( in the form of the customs and border protection and immigration and customs enforcement agencies ) and the department of justice ( by way of u . s . attorneys and district courts along the border ). <PARA> one feature of operation streamline is that immigrants are often processed en masse rather than in separate criminal cases . in 2014 , a u . s . district court judge in tucson , arizona , told the <MORE> in border security in the yuma sector \u201d and was \u201c associated with a recidivism rate that is well below average and has seen a steady decrease in recidivism in recent years .\u201d <PARA> for 2012 and 2013 , border patrol data show that the rate of recidivism ( a person illegally entering the united <MASK> more than once in the same year ) was almost three times as low among individuals processed in criminal courts under operation streamline than it was among individuals allowed to simply leave the united <MASK> at their own expense , a system known as \u201c voluntary return .\u201d <PARA> however , critics have condemned operation streamline as distracting law enforcement agencies and federal prosecutors from targeting violent crime and drug trafficking by attempting a \u201c zero tolerance \u201d approach to all those who cross the border illegally ( many of whom are themselves fleeing violence and criminal gangs ), overloading federal courts in border districts , costing too much , and violating the due process rights of detained immigrants by prosecuting them en masse . <PARA> in 2009 , the u . s . court of appeals for the ninth circuit ruled that the collective court hearings typical of operation streamline violated due process norms , because even if a large number of defendants were processed together in a courtroom , the court was still obligated to deal with each of them on an individual basis . in his ruling , circuit judge john noonan wrote that : <PARA> president trump \u2019 s administration has not \u201c just begun \u201d the use of wristbands and bracelets nor the implementation of operation streamline . however , the trump administration has signaled its intent to ramp up the use of criminal prosecutions . in april 2018 , attorney general jeff sessions wrote to u . s . attorneys ( federal prosecutors ) along the southwestern border , ordering them \u201c to adopt immediately a zero - tolerance policy for all offenses referred for prosecution under section 1325 ( a ).\u201d <PARA> this order is significant , because section 1325 of the u . s . code relates to the misdemeanor of \u201c improper entry \u201d into the united <MASK> , a charge typically brought against first - time border crossers , and historically dealt with using civil and administrative removal from the country . now , attorney general sessions is pushing a policy of using criminal convictions even for first - time misdemeanor \u201c improper entry ,\u201d an approach typically reserved for illegal re - entry after removal or deportation ( which is a felony dealt with under section 1326 of the u . s . code ). <PARA> at a speech in san diego in may 2018 , sessions outlined a hardline approach to illegal border crossings and vowed to separate children from the parents and guardians whom federal border agents would be rounding up for criminal prosecution by u . s . attorneys :",

        "text": "on 2 august 2017 , a reddit user shared a photograph of an information flyer regarding rape and sexual assault to the subreddit r / interestingasfuck : <PARA> the poster did not provide a source or context for the image , and appeared to interact on reddit primarily in the form of submissions . the flyer read : <PARA> although the document appears to be a handout from a rape crisis or advocacy center of some description it also looks as if identifying information ( indicating jurisdiction , among other things ) had been cropped out , priming the image to be shared by a larger audience . <PARA> nothing <MASK> in the flyer was particularly bad or harmful advice , but it also targeted assault victims and made promises that might not always be <MASK> , such as that a hospital escort would be available . further , <MASK> about preventive care following an assault are worthy of double - checking , because of the decreased efficacy of such treatments over the course of hours following an assault . <PARA> the meme \u2019 s first <MASK> is that it is possible to seek medical treatment without reporting the rape or assault to the police , a <MASK> that is gray at best . confidentiality standards maintained by the rape , abuse & incest national network ( rainn ) require sexual assault hotlines to adhere to privacy policies , but we found no sweeping guarantee in the united <MASK> that any third party was prohibited from reporting a suspected rape or assault to local authorities . according to the national network to end domestic violence , inc ., in some situations mandated reporters are bound to report suspected assault or rape regardless of the victim \u2019 s wishes : <PARA> a 2013 question - and - answer piece published by cleveland \u2019 s plain dealer clarifies : <PARA> in 2014 , canadian broadcast outlet cbc reported that a hospital visit does not automatically trigger police involvement in canada , again stipulating that minors do not have the option of refusing police involvement . the meme also said that <MASK> can be collected for up to five days and would be held for six months in the event the victim opted to involve police at a later date . this is potentially misleading . according to the national center for victims of crime [ pdf ], the length of time kits are held by law enforcement fluctuates : <PARA> the same organization noted that advances in dna testing enabled <MASK> collection in some cases for up to 96 hours ( four days ) after an assault . but 12 to 24 hours [ pdf ] is optimal for investigative purposes , and <MASK> can deteriorate at the upper end of that window : <PARA> in other words , four days is stretching the bounds of forensics , and not all jurisdictions hold samples for up to six months . in addition , advocacy groups routinely advise victims to avoid the following before collecting <MASK> : <PARA> the meme went on to <MASK> that testing for incapacitating drugs could occur between 24 and 72 hours after an assault , which is complicated by the breadth of substances that fall into that particular category . although rohypnol ( roofies ) and gamma - hydroxybutyrate ( ghb ) are commonly recognized as agents used to incapacitate victims , alcohol and benzodiazepines also are classed as drugs associated with date rape . ghb has a short half - life , but rohypnol can appear in tests for approximately 28 days . the range of drugs used to facilitate non - consensual sexual encounters is broad enough that a specific window of 24 to 72 hours does not fit that wide spectrum . <PARA> next , the flyer says that medications to prevent sexually transmitted disease and pregnancy must be started within 72 hours .\u201d the world health organization \u2019 s guidance on post - assault care recommends something different : <PARA> when agencies and organizations do recommend prophylactic antibiotics , we found no time limit included . with respect to emergency contraceptives , intra - uterine devices ( iuds ) were considered effective for five days after a rape or unprotected sexual encounter . oral emergency contraceptives ( the \u201c morning after pill \u201d) are not typically recommended after 72 hours , and work best when used as soon as possible after exposure to pregnancy risk . <PARA> the final bullet point appears specific to whatever entity <MASK> published the list . the <MASK> that victims can obtain an escort without a number to call or other resource provided is open - ended , and clearly not applicable in all situations . according to rainn , there is a possibility ( but no guarantee ) victims can connect with the support described on the sheet : <PARA> the rape and sexual assault flyer posted to reddit offers a mixture of <MASK> , <MASK> , and likely region - specific information , running the risk of confusing rape and assault victims in the critical hours after an attack . reference to the upper end of forensic and prophylactic services could lull individuals into a <MASK> sense of security , as does the lack of stipulation that minors or other at - risk individuals are often unable to seek medical care without police involvement .",

        "text": "detroit \u2014 police are warning officers and anyone else displaying bumper stickers supporting law enforcement about a reported threat that gang members may tamper with their vehicles . <PARA> detroit police second deputy chief james fleming , head of the communications bureau , on dec . 30 sent a department wide teletype warning officers : \u201c according to a credible source ... gang members \u2014 notably those in large metropolitan areas \u2014 plan to loosen the lug nuts on officers \u2019 personnel vehicles displaying law enforcement / police benevolent association / fraternal order of police plates or stickers . <PARA> <MASK> : on 5 january 2015 , detroit news published an <MASK> about an internal communication issued by detroit police on 30 december 2014 . the communication in question described a danger posed by gang members who purportedly planned to loosen the lug nuts on car tires belonging either to police officers or civilians who displayed decals openly indicating support of organizations such as the police benevolent association ( pba ) or the fraternal order of police ( fop ). <PARA> the belief that \u201c gang members \u201d planned to target car tire lug nuts did not <MASK> with the <MASK> of 5 january 2015 , nor was the 30 december 2014 internal memo its first public appearance . the idea individuals with a grudge against police would be attracted to vehicle lug nuts was floated on 24 december 2014 in broader news coverage of ongoing public debate in new york city regarding the relationship between the police and the public . in that iteration , the \u201c lug nuts \u201d threat was framed as an example of one of many things an individual intending to harm police might do that would warrant general heightened precaution among officers : <PARA> in addition to the threats , police have increased security at precincts throughout the city to prevent acts of vandalism , such as loosening lug nuts on the tires of squad cars , and other acts that may endanger the lives of cops , sources [ said ]. <PARA> in the brief mention on 24 december 2014 , no reports of such instances of lug nut tampering were cited , and the source from whom the idea <MASK> was not described . at some point between the mention of hypothetical lug nut tampering ( describing how a grudge bearer might mess with the cops ) on 24 december <PARA> and the detroit memo issued on 30 december 2014 , the notion evolved from an illustrative scenario to a real gang member threat . <PARA> it \u2019 s certainly possible organized criminals inform police officers of their planned crimes prior to engaging in sordid dealings , or undercover operatives are able to drop a dime on their unwitting gangland contacts . however , gangs and cops do not historically have a friendly relationship , and there \u2019 s no reason for their members to be angrier with law enforcement during the <MORE> motive ascribed to the purported threat . presumably gangs are always displeased with law enforcement ; and committing an act of vengeance that is virtually undetectable doesn \u2019 t send a message of any description , nor does it result in financial gain for gang members . should any vehicles be tampered with in such a fashion , nothing would connect any resulting accident to any action by gangs . <PARA> the <MASK> seems more implausible when extrapolated to those who are not police but merely display pba or fop stickers on their cars . such stickers are common and widely believed to ward off the issuance of moving violation tickets by officers of the law ( who may believe the occupants are police supporters and accordingly grant them a wider berth of discretion ), but there \u2019 s no obvious motive for gangs \u2019 wanting to target civilian drivers who have no law enforcement powers . <PARA> finally , detroit police media contacts told the paper no such incidents ( potential or actual ) had occurred in detroit or elsewhere before the communication was issued : <PARA> there have not been any reports of lug nuts being removed from officers cars in or around detroit . <PARA> police in detroit seemed equally perplexed as to why gang members might engage in such an act , one that provided no clear incentive but risked arrest and placed the general public unpredictably in harm \u2019 s way : <PARA> \u201c the idea that people would think that \u2019 s a good idea in any way actually baffles my mind ,\u201d said officer mark diaz , of the detroit police officers association . \u201c this creates a very dangerous situation not just for our police officers but for the general public , when a tire comes off a car , it creates a fatal environment .\u201d <PARA> the <MASK> mirrored many preceding it involving vague , motiveless \u201c gangs \u201d giving shape to otherwise formless fears about a topical and volatile real situation . in this instance , many people were concerned that then - ongoing civil rights demonstrations could inspire bad actors to harm police officers , a fear realized with the murders of two new york police department officers in december 2014 . the circulation of \u201c warnings \u201d about what \u201c gangs \u201d might do served as a vent for ambient fears not only for the safety of law enforcement officers , but also for those who openly and vocally support them . assigning a specific , preventable act to the unspecified criminals afforded a measure of certainty and potential control over what was a frighteningly unpredictable controversy : no one could predict an incident in which two innocent officers were ambushed and gunned down while on their lunch break , but police and their supporters can consistently check their lug nuts and thereby obtain a small bit of otherwise elusive security in the wake of the murders .",

        "text": "in the aftermath of the 1 october 2017 mass shooting in las vegas , the american public attempted to come to grips with the scale of gun violence in the united <MASK> . one oft - cited <MASK> posted in social media by \u201c the other 98 %\u201d maintained that 1 . 3 million americans had been killed in all the wars in u . s . <MASK> , while 1 . 5 million americans had been killed by firearms ( in non - military use ) since 1968 alone : <PARA> nbc news reported similar figures : <PARA> different versions of this <MASK> have been prominently offered in recent years by sources such as new york times columnist nicolas kristof in 2015 , and pbs newshour contributor and commentator mark shields in 2012 . <PARA> all these <MASK> contain casual uses of the qualifier \u201c americans \u201d in reference to gun deaths , which is somewhat confusing because not everyone who has been killed by firearms in the united <MASK> was an american citizen , and official sources for gun death <MASK> do not offer breakdowns by nationality . therefore , we assume that \u201c americans \u201d is used here for rhetorical effect , rather than as a functional <MASK> category , and deal with the total number of gun deaths occurring in the united <MASK> since 1968 . similarly , according to the historian don h . doyle , the u . s . civil war saw around 543 , 000 foreign - born ( i . e ., immigrant ) soldiers fighting on the union side alone , so a significant number of civil war deaths might have involved non - american citizen combatants , but we \u2019 ll count them all as \u201c americans .\u201d ( indeed , non - u . s . citizens have likely served and died fighting for the u . s . side in every american military conflict since the revolutionary war , but probably in much greater numbers during the civil war than any other .) <PARA> support for this <MASK> often uses sources that relate only to combatant deaths in wars and do not include civilian or other non - combatant deaths ( the latter being figures which might also include non - u . s . citizens ). one could argue that civilian deaths in wars should be included ( although estimates of these deaths are much less reliable than for fatalities among military personnel ), but we are limiting our analysis to include only combatant deaths in military conflicts . <PARA> we \u2019 ll break this analysis into two parts : the total number of deaths in the united <MASK> involving firearms since 1968 , and the number of deaths in the u . s . and among american combatants across all wars in american <MASK> . <PARA> gun deaths <PARA> the estimated total number of firearms - related deaths from 1968 - 2016 is 1 . <MORE> trust , a non - profit organisation primarily dedicated to preserving american battlefields , estimates that around 6 , 800 people died in battle during the revolutionary war , with an additional 17 , 000 deaths caused by disease , and between 8 , 000 and 12 , 000 more deaths occurring among those held as prisoners of war . the upper end of this estimate range , then , would put the total number of deaths associated with the american revolutionary war at 26 , 800 . <PARA> similarly , the civil war trust estimates that around 15 , 000 americans died during the war of 1812 , a significantly higher number than the 2 , 260 battle deaths estimated by the department of veterans affairs . <PARA> the civil war is an interesting case . based on from the work of two late 19th and early 20th century historians , the widely accepted figure for deaths in this conflict was reckoned as 618 , 222 for about a century . in 2011 , however , j . david hacker ( then of binghamton university ) published a significant upwards revision of that total , estimating that the likely death toll was between 650 , 000 and 851 , 000 . taking the mid - point in this estimate range assumes about 750 , 000 combatant deaths for the civil war . because of the enhanced <MASK> sophistication involved in hacker \u2019 s research , and what appears to be acceptance and support of his estimate among historians , we are going to use 750 , 000 as the estimated death toll among combatants in the civil war . <PARA> figures for the global war on terror are taken from the department of defense \u2019 s defense casualty analysis system and are valid as of october 2017 . <PARA> afghanistan war : <PARA> iraq war : <PARA> if we rely on the department of veterans affairs summary , while accepting j . david hacker \u2019 s 750 , 000 estimate for the civil war , the total number of deaths among american combatants in all u . s . military conflicts , using high estimates for each , is thus 1 , 481 , 862 \u2014 about 100 , 000 less than the total number of firearms - related fatalities in the u . s . between 1968 and 2016 . <PARA> so even using the higher end of available estimates for war deaths throughout american <MASK> , the grand total of those deaths is still lower than the total of firearms - related fatalities since 1968 , a period of just 49 years . although this disparity between war deaths and gun deaths is smaller than the gap <MASK> by the other 98 % ( 200 , 000 ) or nbc news ( 300 , 000 ), the imprecision of casualty estimates ( especially for the civil war era ) allows for a considerable margin of error .",

( the theory has been advanced that any wood fire produces dioxins , but that might be taking it a bit far .) some tampons and sanitary pads contain minute amounts of this chemical , but so do milk cartons . dioxins also turn up in fish , meat , and dairy products . <PARA> those concerned about exposure to dioxins through their feminine products should make the move to unbleached ones . they should keep in mind though that dioxins are all around them , and changing their brand of tampon or napkin won \u2019 t eliminate all exposures to dioxins . perhaps that \u2019 s the greatest disservice e - mails like this do \u2014 they leave readers with the impression that a problem is easily solved by making an angry phone call to an errant manufacturer . <PARA> would that it were that simple . <PARA> to round this up for those in the bleachers , there is no asbestos in tampons . depending on the brand , there might be minute amounts of dioxins in some of them , but not ( according to the fda ) enough to harm anyone . thinking consumers might want to reduce their contact with dioxins anyway , trading comfort and absorbency for a bit more peace of mind . <PARA> barbara \u201c monthly dilemma \u201d mikkelson",

year college degree is required , not just a two - year course ) even more strongly supports the underlying argument in the meme , that police officers in the nordic countries undergo longer training programs than their american counterparts . <PARA> a spokesperson for the national police board in finland provided us a list of nine fatalities attributed to police actions between 2000 and 2018 . however , one of those nine deaths involved a tazer , and another involved a police officer \u2019 s accidentally shooting a prison guard , so seven members of the public were killed ( all shot dead ) due to actions taken by police since 2000 in finland . <PARA> the national police board spokesperson also provided somewhat extraordinary <MORE> <PARA> the u . s . does not maintain an official national database of incidents in which police officers \u2019 actions have led to the death of civilians , so we can \u2019 t know for certain the number of people killed by police between 2001 and 2018 , as vox noted in 2015 : <PARA> however , commendable and methodologically rigorous efforts have been undertaken to create an unofficial database , notably by the fatal encounters website , which has been used as a data source in academic research . <PARA> according to the fatal encounters database , 23 , 977 deaths took place at the hands of police between 2001 and 2018 , which suggests that the figure of \u201c more than 8 , 000 \u201d may be a significant underestimation . <PARA> <!\u2013 <PARA> this reckoning is supported by another robust source , the guardian \u2018 s database of police use of deadly force for 2015 and 2016 , which tallied 1 , 146 and 1 , 093 deaths in 2015 and 2016 , respectively . those figures suggest that the meme \u2019 s tally of about 450 persons killed on average per year by police over the last 18 years is probably on the low side . <PARA> \u2013> <PARA> the factual <MASK> in the meme are mostly accurate , but the underlying implication behind the meme , that shorter training programs cause the relatively high number of police killings in the united <MASK> , is questionable . <PARA> several unmentioned factors are likely to be more relevant and prominent as causes . according to a 2015 <MASK> by the sociologist and criminal justice professor paul hirschfield , these include : the arming of police ( which is not routine in norway and iceland , though it is in finland ), a higher prevalence of guns among the general public (\u201c american police are primed to expect guns \u201d), decentralized and under - resourced police training ( although hirschfield does not mention the duration of training as a factor ), and racial biases ( whether conscious or unconscious ) among law enforcement officers . <PARA> although it \u2019 s <MASK> that the united <MASK> has a vastly higher population than any of the nordic countries mentioned in the meme , it has a much higher prevalence of police killings , even when population is taken into account . <PARA> we counted the total number of police killings in each country between 2002 and 2017 ( using fatal encounters \u2019 data for the u . s .), then adjusted for each country \u2019 s average population over the course of that 16 - year period . that method equated to 71 police killings per million people in the u . s ., over that time period ; 3 . 2 per million people in iceland ; 1 . 5 per million people in finland , and 0 . 8 police killings per million people in norway .",

fire weapons such as the legally - purchased semiautomatic rifle used in the florida shooting . for its part , the national rifle association ( america \u2019 s most powerful and deep - pocketed gun rights lobbying group ) fell back on the well - trodden argument that more guns , not fewer guns \u2014 in the hands of teachers and armed guards in schools , for example \u2014 was the best way to ameliorate the gun violence issue . <PARA> over the past 50 years , the national rifle association ( nra ) has opposed most legislative efforts to restrict citizens \u2019 right to bear arms , regardless of the justification . but , as gun control advocates were quick to point out in the wake of the florida shooting , a notable exception occurred in 1967 : <PARA> social media postings noted that in contrast to their current policy of backing laws that allow citizens to openly carry loaded firearms in public , in 1967 the nra supported a <MASK> ban on open carry in california after armed members of the black panther party started patrolling city streets to counter police brutality . a facebook meme hammered the point home with an image of black panthers brandishing weapons in the california <MASK> capitol : <PARA> it \u2019 s <MASK> that the mulford act , which prohibited anyone outside of law enforcement officers ( and others explicitly authorized to do so ) from carrying loaded firearms in public , was enacted largely in response to the militant activities of the black panther party . it \u2019 s also <MASK> that the bill was written by a republican legislator , california assemblyman don mulford of oakland , and was passed with the full backing of republican governor ronald reagan and the national rifle association . <PARA> the bill was introduced in april 1967 , six weeks after it had been reported that an armed group of black panthers acting as an escort for malcolm x \u2019 s widow , betty shabazz , were involved in tense , nonviolent confrontations with airport security officers and police in san francisco . as leftist writer sol stern later noted in ramparts , \u201c local cops were dumbfounded to discover that there was no law which prohibited the panthers from carrying loaded weapons so long as they were unconcealed , a legal fact which the panthers had carefully researched .\u201d <PARA> in a <MASK> <MASK> by associated press , a panther spokesman said , <MORE> panthers protested the mulford bill by sending an armed contingent to the <MASK> capitol on 2 may 1967 . that was a day ronald reagan would never forget \u2014 nor , for that matter , remember accurately . <PARA> this is how he described the event and its aftermath in a personal letter written in 1979 : <PARA> it wasn \u2019 t <MASK> , however , that the black panthers had held legislators \u201c under the muzzles of guns \u201d for hours . they were disarmed by the capitol police soon after entering the building , and , according to most contemporaneous accounts ( including that of the associated press ) were escorted out of the chambers 30 minutes later : <PARA> reagan was also in error when he <MASK> that the bill was introduced after the panthers departed ( as noted above , it had been introduced a month earlier ), but it was revised with provisions strengthening security measures for the governor and the legislature in particular , and it was fast - tracked for passage the following month . <PARA> an addendum justifying immediate enactment of the bill specifically referenced the black panther incident ( although this verbiage was generalized in a later draft to cite the threat of \u201c organized groups and individuals publicly arming themselves for purposes inimical to the peace and safety of the people of california \u201d): <PARA> the bill cleared the <MASK> \u2019 s senate judiciary committee on 1 june 1967 after mulford testified that it had been very carefully considered and had the support of the national rifle association , according to a united press report published the following day . it was passed by a bipartisan majority of the full senate and signed into law by governor reagan in july . <PARA> sen . john schmitz , who had tried unsuccessfully to defeat the bill , penned an editorial holding the nra directly responsible for its passage , saying : \u201c members of the national rifle association in california should know that their organization , despite its record of opposing gun control bills in the past , favored this bill and that without nra support it almost certainly would have been defeated .\u201d <PARA> despite angrily observing that the first real \u201c victim \u201d of the mulford act was \u201c not a \u2018 black panther ,\u2019 nor a rioter , nor a criminal ,\u201d but rather an upstanding member of the republican party arrested for carrying a loaded gun in his vehicle , schmitz failed in his efforts to repeal the act . <PARA> the national rifle association would later ( during the 1970s ) harden their stance against any limitations on the right to bear arms , but in 1967 , when the black panthers emerged as the most militant defenders of that right , the nra took a very different position . <PARA> their mutual legacy , the mulford act , is still on the books today .",

        "text": "<MASK> : as most beatles fans know , the fab four recorded for emi , and the executives at emi \u2019 s american subsidiary , capitol records , were so square that they declined to issue any of the beatles \u2019 first four singles ( or <PARA> their first album ) in the usa , thinking that beatles music wouldn \u2019 t sell in the american market . as a result , in 1963 the first beatles records were released in america by vee - jay , a small chicago - based label . <PARA> flash forward to early 1964 . capitol records , finally having realized that beatles records would sell in america , is launching an expensive publicity campaign to promote the beatles and their new single , \u201c i want to hold your hand .\u201d they \u2019 re also engaged in a lawsuit with vee - jay records over who has the american rights to the beatles \u2019 small but suddenly valuable back catalog ( i . e ., all the material capitol passed on releasing in the first place ). vee - jay , who has the masters to all the tracks on the beatles \u2019 first lp , wants to take advantage of beatlemania by releasing an album , but they \u2019 re not sure if they have the legal rights to use those masters . so vee - jay comes up with a clever ( if misleading ) solution : a \u201c concept \u201d album . <PARA> vee - jay was relatively sure they had the rights to the four beatles songs they \u2019 d released on singles in 1963 (\u201c please please me \u201d b / w \u201c ask me why \u201d and \u201c from me to you \u201d b / w \u201c thank you girl \u201d), but four songs do not an album make . for a solution , they turned to the only other british act on their roster : frank ifield , an australian who had achieved moderate success on british pop charts . by combining eight frank ifield tracks with <PARA> their four beatles songs , vee - jay created an album called \u201c jolly what !\u201d and advertised it as \u201c england \u2019 s greatest recording stars \u2014 the beatles & frank ifield on stage ,\u201d sold in a cover featuring a silly graphic of mustachioed english gentleman bearing spectacles and a beatle wig . <PARA> the \u201c jolly what !\u201d lp was , of course , a total rip - off , because it contained only four beatles songs ( all of which had already been released ), because frank ifield was in no way one of \u201c england \u2019 s greatest recording stars ,\u201d and because the \u201c on stage \u201d portion of the title was deceptive , as all of the tracks were studio recordings . ( the only justification for the \u201c on stage \u201d designation seemed to be that the beatles and frank ifield had once appeared on the same bill at the embassy cinema in petersborough , over a year earlier .) <PARA> even worse , after vee - jay negotiated a settlement with capitol records that allowed them to use the masters to the beatles \u2019 first album until october 1964 , vee - jay re - released the same rip - off album , only this time they made it even more deceptive by putting a prominent graphic of the beatles on the cover along with the names of the meager four beatles songs to be found within , creating the impression that this was a whole lp of beatles material . <PARA> worse frauds have been perpetrated on the record - buying public , before and since . ( even the rolling stones once released studio tracks overdubbed with crowd noises to create phony \u201c live \u201d recordings .) what makes this one notable is the concluding sentence of the liner notes on the back of both versions of the album : <PARA> yes , that says just what it looks like : \u201c it is with a good deal of pride and pleasure that this copulation has been presented .\u201d and this was no printer \u2019 s mistake , as the <MASK> telegram by which the copy text was transmitted to the printer clearly contained the word \u201c copulation .\u201d whether the author of the liner notes mistakenly ( rather than mischievously ) used the word \u201c copulation \u201d instead of \u201c compilation \u201d is unknown , but it provided an apt description of a record that screwed consumers out of their money .",

        "text": "<MASK> : on our \u201c back and fourth \u201d page \u2014 about <PARA> the legend of a music student caught handing in a backwards version of someone else \u2019 s composition rather than creating his own \u2014 we discuss the concept that ( in western music , at least ) one cannot create a viable piece of music by simply reversing an existing work . this prompted many readers to write to us and maintain that john lennon had done just that , creating the song \u201c because \u201d ( on the beatles \u2019 abbey road album ) by turning beethoven \u2019 s \u201c moonlight sonata \u201d backwards . although there is some basis for this <MASK> , \u201c because \u201d is far from being merely a reversed version of a beethoven work in the literal sense implied in the college legend . <PARA> beethoven \u2019 s sonata in c - sharp minor ( op . 27 , no . 2 , <MASK> titled \u201c quasi una fantasia \u201d and also known as the \u201c arbor \u201d sonata ), written in 1801 , has been associated with a number of romantic stories . when the sonata was published in 1803 it was dedicated to his young piano student countess giulietta guicciardi , but beethoven apparently did not have her in mind at the time he wrote it . the \u201c moonlight sonata \u201d ( a title not given to the piece until after beethoven \u2019 s death ) was immediately popular upon publication and has remained the most well - known of beethoven \u2019 s sonatas ever since , although most people are familiar only with the first of the sonata \u2019 s three movements . john lennon \u2019 s dream - like \u201c because ,\u201d recorded in gorgeous nine - part harmony ( three voices recorded three times ) for the beatles \u2019 final album in 1969 , shares several attributes \u2014 its key ( c - sharp minor ), its chord structure , and its use of <PARA> arpeggios ( tones of a chord played in succession rather than simultaneously ) \u2014 with beethoven \u2019 s \u201c moonlight sonata ,\u201d but \u201c because \u201d is not at all a song created by simply turning a beethoven work around from back to front . <PARA> finding similarities between the music of the beatles and beethoven is intriguing because it highlights a commonality between the ( supposedly antithetical ) high art of a cultured classical composer and the popular music of four provincial , musically unschooled and self - taught liverpudlian youths , and the idea of the beatles \u2019 turning a piece of music backwards certainly requires no stretch of the imagination when one recalls their use of reversed vocals in the fade - out of \u201c rain \u201d or the backwards guitar solo in \u201c i \u2019 m only sleeping .\u201d however , \u201c because \u201d is more accurately described as a song based upon or inspired by <MORE> of john \u2019 s ( and yoko \u2019 s ) comments about \u201c because \u201d demonstrate that what lennon had in mind was a song based upon a reversal of \u201c moonlight sonata \u201d\u2018 s chord progression , not literally a backwards version of the piece : <PARA> this is about me and yoko in the early days . yoko was playing some beethoven chords and i said to play them backwards . [\u201c because \u201d] is really \u201c moonlight sonata \u201d backwards . <PARA> <PARA> piano has been my security blanket all my life , and whenever i \u2019 m nervous or something , i tend to go to the piano . i was playing \u201c moonlight sonata ,\u201d i think , and john said , \u201c its beautiful , beautiful \u2014 ah , could we just hear the chords , and could we play it from this end , and all that , you know , sort of backwards \u201d. <PARA> and he used the chord progression . . . from the back on . it worked . <PARA> well , it wasn \u2019 t quite the reverse , i mean , it wasn \u2019 t exact or anything \u2014 that was the inspiration . <PARA> piano has been my security blanket all my life , and whenever i \u2019 m nervous or something , i tend to go to the piano . i was playing \u201c moonlight sonata ,\u201d i think , and john said , \u201c its beautiful , beautiful \u2014 ah , could we just hear the chords , and could we play it from this end , and all that , you know , sort of backwards \u201d. <PARA> and he used the chord progression . . . from the back on . it worked . <PARA> well , it wasn \u2019 t quite the reverse , i mean , it wasn \u2019 t exact or anything \u2014 that was the inspiration . <PARA> even at that , \u201c because \u201d is much more than a song based on the chord sequence of \u201c moonlight sonata \u201d in reverse \u2014 the chord progressions of \u201c because \u201d and a backwards \u201c moonlight sonata \u201d are similar but not identical , and the melody of \u201c because \u201d is much closer to a forwards version of \u201c moonlight sonata \u201d than a backwards one , as john acknowledged : <PARA> i was lying on the sofa in our house , listening to yoko play beethoven \u2019 s \u2018 moonlight sonata \u2019 on the piano . suddenly , i said , \u2018 can you play those chords backward ?\u2019 she did , and i wrote \u2018 because \u2019 around them . the song sounds like \u2018 moonlight sonata ,\u2019 too . <PARA> readers interested in a technical discussion of the musical similarities between \u201c because \u201d and \u201c moonlight sonata \u201d might enjoy ian hammond \u2019 s essay on the subject from his beathoven series .",

        "text": "on 4 april 2017 , the washington free beacon published a report <MASK> that elizabeth warren of massachusetts , who is considered one of the more politically progressive members of the u . s . senate , pays her male staffers more than she pays her female staffers , despite the her emphatic public <MASK> on behalf of equal pay for female workers : <PARA> however , the implied <MASK> that warren pays women less than men for equivalent work is flawed because the free beacon report didn \u2019 t account for differing pay among job titles \u2014 in other words , it was an apples - to - oranges comparison that didn \u2019 t actually compare the pay of workers of both genders who perform equivalent job duties . the report also only used salary data for staffers who worked in warren \u2019 s office for the full 2016 fiscal year ( which spanned parts of 2015 and 2016 ), a selective and arbitrary timeframe that eliminated the most obvious comparison available . <PARA> in regards to the latter point , we note that mindy myers , a woman , and daniel geldon , a man , held the same position as warren \u2019 s chief of staff consecutively . as chief of staff in 2015 , myers earned $ 164 , 458 , and when she left at the end of the year ( and later accepted a position as executive director of the democratic senatorial campaign committee ), she was replaced by geldon , whose salary is the same as hers was , according to salary data from the secretary of the senate . the free beacon excluded myers and geldon from their analysis on the basis that neither worked for warren throughout the full 2015 - 2016 fiscal year and therefore didn \u2019 t note that the two were paid equally for holding the same job position . <PARA> as to the former point , brad fitch , chief executive officer at the congressional management foundation ( a nonprofit dedicated to improving operations in congress and citizen engagement with lawmakers ), noted that in order to fairly assess gender pay parity , researchers must take into account variables such as experience and education levels , as well as staff turnover and the reality that people with different job titles earn different salaries \u2014 factors not considered in the free beacon \u2018 s analysis : <PARA> fairly comparing pay rates between men and women who work in senator warren \u2019 s office is therefore a challenge because not many of her staffers hold the same job titles , and even among those who do , pay discrepancies between men and women are not obvious when education and experience are factored in . for example , of the ten people who were \u201c regional directors \u201d on warren \u2019 s staff in the first half of the 2016 fiscal year , the highest - paid was a man who holds a j . d . and has worked for warren since 2012 . the second - highest paid was a woman who was promoted and received a raise in the second half of the year , setting her pay higher than that of the highest - paid male regional director ( but also changing her job title ). <PARA> additional factors not considered include that at least one of warren \u2019 s staffers , lauren miller , also works for the senator \u2019 s campaign , so her office salary of $ 69 , 324 in the 2016 fiscal year is probably only part of her full compensation . additionally , kaaren hinck earned $ 118 , 332 in 2015 as an adviser to warren , but she wasn \u2019 t included in the report because she left her job halfway through the fiscal year . yet another woman whose pay wasn \u2019 t counted was tracey lewis , who earned $ 33 , 000 while working as warren \u2019 s <MASK> strategic adviser for just 4 months . <PARA> salary information for senator warren \u2019 s staff is publicly available through the secretary of the senate \u2019 s office , but the free beacon \u2019 s use of only the most recent fiscal year \u2019 s data , their exclusion of high - earning women on senator warren \u2019 s office staff due to narrow ( and seemingly arbitrary ) selection criteria , and their non - consideration of job duties and titles doesn \u2019 t support the implication that senator warren pays women less than men for equivalent work . at best , it shows that male staffers earned more than female staffers in senator warren \u2019 s office because more men occupied the top positions among her staff during a selected time frame .",

2003 \u2014 is hardly a shocker . <PARA> the problem is that mcdonald \u2019 s maintains the coupon is bogus . when we called their customer service number to inquire , they reported that the coupon \u201c did not issue from within the mcdonald \u2019 s corporation \u201d and that they \u201c were not distributing this coupon at this time .\u201d ( we specifically asked whether this item was perhaps a scanned copy of a legitimate coupon which someone set loose on the internet without authorization , and they told us it was not .) this item has now become so wide - spread that the mcdonald \u2019 s customer service number now features a specific option for customers calling to inquire about the coupon : <PARA> if you are calling about the mcdonald \u2019 s salad coupon , please press # 1 <PARA> thank you for calling mcdonald \u2019 s to inquire about an electronic coupon you may have received for a mcdonald \u2019 s premium salad . <PARA> we regret to let you know that this coupon has not been distributed or authorized by mcdonald \u2019 s corporation . <PARA> unfortunately the coupon has been circulating via e - mail , and it \u2019 s important to know that this is not a valid offer . <PARA> we deeply regret any inconvenience this may have caused you . <PARA> thank you for calling mcdonald \u2019 s to inquire about an electronic coupon you may have received for a mcdonald \u2019 s premium salad . <PARA> we regret to let you know that this coupon has not been distributed or authorized by mcdonald \u2019 s corporation . <PARA> unfortunately the coupon has been circulating via e - mail , and it \u2019 s important to know that this is not a valid offer . <PARA> we deeply regret any inconvenience this may have caused you . <PARA> mcdonald \u2019 s also says the same thing on its web site : <PARA> the premium salad coupon depicted ( and those similar ) is an invalid coupon , and its distribution via email and internet was not authorized by mcdonald \u2019 s . <PARA> we regret if this has inconvenienced you in any way . <PARA> it is sometimes difficult to determine what is legitimate on the internet . you can be assured that we are investigating this matter . <PARA> we always appreciate your visits to mcdonald \u2019 s and thank you for your understanding . <PARA> we regret if this has inconvenienced you in any way . <PARA> it is sometimes difficult to determine what is legitimate on the internet . you can be assured that we are investigating this matter . <PARA> we always appreciate your visits to mcdonald \u2019 s and thank you for your understanding . <PARA> frankly , those sound like some carefully chosen weasel words to us . the full version of the coupon being circulated on the internet ( viewable as a 500k pdf file ) includes a print - quality cover letter , full - color advertisement , and coupon , complete with the new mcdonald \u2019 s premium salad logos and customer service phone numbers \u2014 all of which seems like an awful lot of time and effort for someone to expend in counterfeiting a phony coupon for something as inexpensive as a mcdonald \u2019 s <PARA> salad . <PARA> our guess is that this was some form of valid coupon issued in a limited fashion by mcdonald \u2019 s ( perhaps to stockholders ), but once it was loosed upon the internet as a forwarded file ( from which anyone could print as many copies as desired ), mcdonald \u2019 s corporate had to <MASK> it as invalid ( which it technically is , if mcdonald \u2019 s did not authorize its distribution over the internet ). the first version of the coupon <MASK> itself to be reedemable at \u201c any mcdonald \u2019 s in the <MASK> of kansas , missouri and st . louis and metro east area ,\u201d but now other coupons \u201c redeemable at any mcdonald \u2019 s in the continental u . s .\u201d are turning up as well . <PARA> however these coupons came to be , mcdonald \u2019 s says they won \u2019 t accept them . of course , since not all mcdonald \u2019 s franchises necessarily know they \u2019 re not supposed to redeem them , internet - distributed coupons are pretty hard to distinguish from legitimate coupons , and the worst that can happen is for the coupons to be disallowed , many people have tried using them anyway , and apparently some have succeeded . so , in that sense the coupons are redeemable , even though they \u2019 re not supposed to be .",

        "text": "in the days immediately following the worst mass shooting in modern american <MASK> , in which 58 people were killed and 527 injured by automatic gunfire while listening to music at an outdoor festival on the las vegas strip on 1 october 2017 , disreputable web sites like yournewswire and naturalnews . com immediately leapt at the ensuing chaos to push <MASK> conspiracy theories . <PARA> police say that the shooting was perpetrated by stephen paddock , a 64 - year - old resident of mesquite , nevada , who opened fire with a modified weapon from the 32nd floor of the mandalay bay resort and casino . according to their ongoing investigation , paddock acted alone . these findings can be easily verified by listening to police radio traffic from the incident , in which officers say they hear gunfire coming from the 32nd floor of the hotel , identify paddock \u2019 s room , then burst in , only to find him deceased inside with a large number of firearms . <PARA> however , that has not stopped web sites with a less than nodding acquaintance with journalistic integrity from latching on to the mass casualty incident while taking advantage of the chaos and confusion to push conspiracy theories and collect resulting ad revenue . for example , on 2 october 2017 , yournewswire , a web site that regularly inserts itself into tragedies to push the anti - semitic new world order conspiracy theory , reported : <PARA> the las vegas metropolitan police department ( lvmpd ), which is the lead law enforcement agency handling the investigation of the shooting , found 23 weapons in the hotel room with paddock after breaching the door . they have determined he modified a semiautomatic rifle to make it shoot continuous rounds like a fully automatic weapon , and then he fired into a concert crowd from his perch in a 32nd floor suite at the mandalay bay resort and casino . during a 2 october 2017 press briefing , lvmpd assistant sheriff todd fasulo took time to refute <MASK> that there was more than one gunman : <PARA> the \u201c <MASK> \u201d provided by yournewswire and on other conspiracy sites like zerohedge . com is a widely - shared , roughly 35 - second blurry youtube video in which the narrators <MASK> to have captured muzzle flashes coming from a room on the fourth floor of the mandalay bay hotel . the video can be viewed here : <PARA> the second video posted by yournewswire as \u201c <MASK> \u201d of a second shooter on the fourth floor appears to have been taken by a cab driver who was near the hotel during the incident \u2014 but while gunfire can be heard in her video , no muzzle flashes are in fact visible . <PARA> according to police , paddock fired on the crowd of 22 , 000 people from room 32135 , a large suite in the north of the building . ( the mandalay bay resort and casino is shaped like a three - sided star , and paddock \u2019 s room was situated as far north in the building as possible , while the route 91 harvest festival he attacked was just northeast of the building and across the north - south thoroughfare las vegas boulevard .) <PARA> in emergency radio traffic , which can be accessed through the scanner - capturing web site broadcastify , it is clear that responding officers initially didn \u2019 t know where the shots were coming from , and were getting reports from witnesses that there may have been more than one shooter . eventually , however , they were able to pin down the location . one officer can be heard saying : <PARA> another officer seems to debunk the idea that there were muzzle flashes coming from the fourth floor , when he can be heard saying that he \u2019 s seeing a strobe light flashing on the east wing of the building : <PARA> there is no <MASK> to support the <MASK> that there were multiple shooters or that those shooters \u2019 muzzle flashes could be seen from the fourth floor of the resort . as we noted , police believe through their investigation that paddock acted alone during the shooting . the youtube video presented as <MASK> for this <MASK> appears to show a strobe light in one of the rooms , as <MASK> by footage that seems to show the same light flashing well before the shooting , and the observation by a police officer at the scene who said it was a strobe light . <PARA> the fact that police received reports from traumatized witnesses of multiple shooters in the immediate aftermath of the tragedy is not surprising , nor does it offer conclusive <MASK> that there was more than one assailant , said bill flores , a retired assistant sheriff with the san diego county sheriff \u2019 s department . he told us : <PARA> furthermore , radio traffic from incident makes it clear police officers were climbing the stairs of the building floor by floor , and it defies logic to believe they would not have heard automatic gunfire coming from the fourth floor , when they clearly heard it coming from paddock \u2019 s room . <PARA> on 5 october 2017 lvmpd officer larry hadfield confirmed to us that per the investigation , paddock has been identified as the lone shooter : <PARA> police radio traffic from the incident can be heard here :",

( stories about bill \u2019 s interest in gals other than his wife would pop up at various times throughout his two terms , but it was not until his second term that any of them was accorded much weight . during that first term these <MASK> generally died on the vine , which is surprising given how many different <MASK> liaisons there were .) <PARA> the <MASK> about the lamp moved into the print media on 19 february 1993 when the chicago sun - times reported : <PARA> seems first lady hillary rodham clinton has a temper to match her hubby \u2019 s . wicked washington whispers <MASK> hillary broke a lamp during a heated late night argument with the president . not to worry : the lamp was in the family quarters , belonged to the clintons and \u201c wasn \u2019 t a priceless antique , or anything like that ,\u201d says a white house source . <PARA> notice that in this early incarnation , hillary merely broke a lamp during an argument with bill ; she didn \u2019 t launch it at him . the attempt to defuse the tale by characterizing the lamp as one of low value , and a personal possession to boot , actually works the other way \u2014 it focuses more attention on the actions of the people involved by resolving what would otherwise be nagging questions about the value of the property destroyed and speculation on whether it had been a historic white house piece . <PARA> unlike the \u201c wandering eye president \u201d <MASK> , the lamp <MASK> was a keeper . by march , it had found its way into a number of major publications , and by summer it had achieved the <MASK> of topic joking references were made to on late - night television . yet even before it was <MORE> a book ,\u201d one worker told brower . <PARA> in the second book - throwing incident in the residence , a volume \u201c came flying out of \u201d the bedroom while the first lady was in it . it \u2019 s <PARA> insinuated that the tome was the infamous edition of \u201c leaves of grass \u201d that bill clinton eventually gave to lewinsky and that the first lady had discovered the gift intended for her husband \u2019 s mistress . <PARA> \u201c we \u2019 re pretty sure she clocked him with a book ,\u201d one worker told brower . <PARA> but as we noted earlier , tales with identical details ( i . e ., hillary threw a book at her husband , drawing blood in the process ) had already been circulating years before the lewinsky affair , so we have to wonder how it was that bill clinton apparently never learned to scram ( or at least duck ) when confronted by an angry spouse with a penchant for book - throwing and deadly aim . moreover , as the washington post \u2018 s emily heil noted in her summary of the residence \u2018 s account of bill \u2019 s alleged book - beaning : <PARA> another element of the <MASK> that raised flags with some veteran clinton watchers ? if the president did get stitches , they were well hidden \u2014 there \u2019 s no indication in news reports at the time that anything appeared amiss with the president \u2019 s head . ( and this was a <PARA> press corps near - obsessed with the president \u2019 s health ; his allergies were frequently the subject of scrutiny , and even his hearing aids <PARA> made headlines ). <PARA> could the lamp <MASK> have been a deliberate attempt by political opponents to undermine the first lady by fabricating a yarn that invoked the very bogey ( wo ) man whom the nation feared was lurking behind the mask ? or were others taken in by a piece of gossip laying responsibility for this whisper at the feet of the republicans ? and could there have been something to the <MASK> , at least an overheard verbal argument between the clintons during which mention was made of throwing something ? <PARA> barring shards of a lamp being unearthed , no one will ever really know . hillary and her people have always denied the <MASK> , but the point is always made they could do no less . denials from that side of the <MASK> are next to worthless . <PARA> even so , the last word should go to mrs . clinton . as she said to barbara walters in a 1996 interview : \u201c i mean , you know i have a pretty good arm . if i \u2019 d thrown a lamp at somebody , i think you would have known about it .\u201d <PARA> barbara \u201c the power behind the thrown \u201d mikkelson",

        "text": "<MASK> : various bits of popular \u201c wisdom \u201d circulate about what ingesting coca - cola and aspirin together will do . the more common ( with the first two being by far the most popular ) are : <PARA> without <PARA> exception , the beverage is always coca - cola and the pain killer is aspirin . no other products will do , apparently \u2014 not <PARA> even another soft drink , let alone a different analgesic . <PARA> these beliefs have been around for decades and are generally picked up in high school . usually , a student hears only one of these old wives \u2019 tales and is unaware others outside his region have heard different things about the efficacy of that particular combination . <PARA> in some parts of the u . s ., girls were in the habit of keeping a careful eye on their cokes , lest some less - than - successful lotharios slip aspirin into their drinks , rendering them wanton and willing . in other areas , kids downed aspirin and cokes with the firm belief that they \u2019 d soon be lightheaded and silly . <PARA> what might well be the <MASK> of the \u201c gets you high \u201d belief appeared in the early 1930s . a doctor from illinois wrote to the journal of the american medical association to warn that teenagers were dissolving aspirin in coca - cola to create an \u201c intoxicating \u201d beverage with addictive properties that were as bad as \u201c narcotic habituation .\u201d his rant was baseless , and the <MASK> eventually died down and stayed down for a very long time . <PARA> the teen years are a time of experimentation and initiation into the world of adult knowledge and thus mark a bridge between childhood and adulthood . two things that kids can \u2019 t do but adults can are drink liquor and engage in sexual activity . it \u2019 s not surprising that a great many of the whispered snippets of secret knowledge exchanged by teens have to do with one or the other of these activities . to kids of that age everything is a mystery , so bits of lore that enhance the aura of mystery fall upon receptive ears . <PARA> teens stand with one leg still in childhood , a time of lessened responsibility . actions aren \u2019 t clearly perceived as having consequences , certainly not in the way <PARA> they will later in life . a teen will be enchanted by the notion that combining a popular soft drink with an equally popular pain killer will result in his getting drunk or <PARA> stoned , and he will set out to get himself into that condition via this method just to prove that he can . never mind that illegal drugs aren \u2019 t all that hard to come by , and a bottle of liquor even less so ( even if one is underage ) \u2014 it \u2019 s the sense of putting one over on the system and not the hoped - for high itself that lies at the heart of this belief \u2019 s attractiveness . <PARA> another eagerly exchanged bit of secret knowledge tangentially related to the \u201c it gets you high \u201d notion is the idea that drinking beer through a straw will render the imbiber utterly legless . it too lacks any basis in reality . however , the psychosomatic effect of such a belief can be startling . <PARA> the belief that the coke - aspirin combination makes for an aphrodisiac leaps straight from the ordinary teen urge to have a way of making the object of his desire feel the same way about him . adolescence is not just a time of awakening sexual feelings , but also of learning how to deal with romantic rejection . it \u2019 s only natural to wish for a magic drug that would make the pain of being rejected a thing of the past by doing away with rejection itself , and what more suitable potion could there be than the most american of beverages combined with something that takes pain away ? <PARA> far less widespread are the beliefs that the combination will kill whoever drinks it or that it will cure a vicious hangover . the first of the two is easy to explain : teens are always seeing lurking phantom dangers in the oddest things \u2014 the more innocuous , the better . perhaps the belief that combining two common products will result in a deadly poison is a teen \u2019 s way of beginning to conceive that the adult world is fraught with dangers . that teens make up the dangers instead of recognizing the real ones is part of their romantic nature \u2014 it \u2019 s much more exciting to imagine godzilla is after you than it is to view a motorcycle through the eyes of someone who has read rider survival <MASK> . <PARA> finally , as for coca - cola and aspirin \u2019 s being a hangover cure , we come to one bit of the lore which has something to it . individually , both of these products couldn \u2019 t help but make things better at a time like that \u2014 the coke because it helps rehydrate an alcohol - dried body , and the aspirin because it eases the physical suffering of a pounding head . when served up together , the combination packs a much greater pain - killing effect than either of the products would on their own because the caffeine in the soda appears to work to boost the effect of the aspirin . <PARA> barbara \u201c coke adds life even to last night \u2019 s life of the party \u201d mikkelson <PARA> sightings : the belief the combination of coke and aspirin forms an intoxicant comes up in the 1978 film grease .",

word in private . for example , he reportedly referred to the civil rights act of 1957 as the \u201c nigger bill \u201d in more than one private phone conversation with senate colleagues . and he reportedly said upon appointing african - american judge thurgood marshall to the supreme court , \u201c son , when i appoint a nigger to the court , i want everyone to know he \u2019 s a nigger .\u201d <PARA> according to historian doris kearns goodwin , he also uttered this cynical -

laden <MASK> were calculated to achieve a specific end , such as convincing his pro - segregation dixiecrat colleagues that it was in their best interests to support civil rights legislation . msnbc reporter adam serwer writes : <PARA> but there were also instances of casual racism that can \u2019 t be so easily rationalized . biographer caro also notes that johnson is said to have replied as follows to a black chauffeur who told him he \u2019 d prefer to be called by name instead of \u201c boy ,\u201d \u201c nigger \u201d or \u201c chief \u201d: <PARA> all of which is to acknowledge that , without question , lyndon johnson used the n -

        "text": "one of the more controversial aspects of the patient protection and affordable care act ( ppaca ) health care reform legislation ( commonly known as \u201c obamacare \u201d) passed by the u . s . congress in 2010 is its requirement mandating that all americans obtain health insurance or pay a monthly fine . one <MASK> which has grown out of this aspect of the ppaca is the <MASK> that some religious groups , particularly muslims ( but also including scientologists , amish , and christian scientists ), are specifically exempted from health insurance requirements of the ppaca : <PARA> the fact is that the ppaca legislation does not specifically exclude any particular religious groups from its provisions . the bill contains a general \u201c religious conscience \u201d section which sets forth guidelines under which religious groups who have established conscientious objections to certain forms of insurance may seek exemption from its health insurance requirements : <PARA> for members of religious groups to qualify for this exemption , they would have to be adherents of a religion or sect \u201c described in section 1402 ( g )( 1 )\u201d of the internal revenue code , which governs exemptions from the payment of social security and medicare taxes on self - employment income . in general , persons seeking a health insurance exemption must belong to a religion ( or sect thereof ) which has been in existence since 1951 and has an established <MASK> of spurning participation in insurance programs : <PARA> how these provisions might be applied is somewhat subjective . groups such as the anabaptists ( i . e ., amish , mennonites , hutterites ) would likely qualify for an exemption from the health insurance requirement , as they have an established <MASK> of declining social security benefits and making their own provisions for dependent members ( as described in the amish faq ): <PARA> whether muslims could qualify for an exemption from the health insurance requirements is more difficult to define , as islam is a much larger religion with practices that vary according to sect and region . although islam does have a tradition of barring conventional insurance products because they \u201c involve an element of uncertainty , gambling and the charging of interest , which are prohibited by the koran ,\u201d some muslim groups make exceptions for insurance which is required by law ( such as automobile insurance ), and some muslim groups do not have objections to medical insurance . most likely , though , muslims would not qualify for an exemption from u . s . health insurance requirements because u . s . muslims do not have a tradition of spurning social security ( which is viewed more as a form of caring for those who are unable to meet their own needs than as something which involves elements of uncertainty , gambling , and interest payments ), and no muslim group has ever qualified for an exemption under the guidelines which define which religious groups would be exempt from the health care law . <PARA> the ppaca does not specifically \u201c deny special exemptions to christians and jews ,\u201d but it is unlikely that either of those groups would qualify for a blanket religious conscience exemption , as neither of those groups has a <MASK> of disdaining or prohibiting the use of insurance among their membership . <PARA> the bottom line is that the health insurance mandate provision of ppaca includes no specific exemptions for muslims , and although it kicked in back in 2014 , no muslims or muslim groups have since been exempted , or sought to be exempted , from its requirements . <PARA> despite frequent mention of the term in internet - circulated <MASK> , the word \u201c dhimmitude \u201d does not appear anywhere in the ppaca , and it has no application to u . s . health care legislation . the term is a french neologism coined by adding the suffix - tude to dhimmi , an arabic word which which literally means \u201c protected \u201d and has historically been used to refer to a person living in a region overrun by muslim conquest who was accorded a protected <MASK> and allowed to retain his <MASK> faith in exchange for payment of taxes .",

( for instance , to save your spot before a call interrupts gameplay .) <PARA> yes , [ the permission requests are potentially \u201c insidious ,\u201d but so are whatsapp , viber , messageme and virtually every other popular messaging app , all of which request comparably creepy permissions . on my insidiousness scale , at least , that ignorance of the devices and programs we use every day probably <MORE> per year \u2014 or about 30 workdays . the full study by aleecia m . mcdonald and lorrie faith cranor is quite interesting . they measure the length of privacy policies , ranging from just 144 words up to 7 , 669 words ( median is around 2 , 500 words ) and recognize that at a standard reading pace of 250 words per minute , most privacy policies take about eight to ten minutes to read . they also ran some tests to figure out how long it actually takes people to read and / or skim privacy policies . they put all of this together and estimated that it would normally take a person about 244 hours per year to read every new privacy policy they encountered ... and even 154 hours just to skim them . <PARA> and , here \u2019 s the thing : that \u2019 s only for privacy policies . imagine if you read terms of service and end user license agreements too ... <PARA> whether facebook messenger \u2019 s tos are truly \u201c insidious \u201d or not , sam fiorella warned that if users are willing to accept tos as lengthy and involved as facebook messenger \u2019 s without reading them , app developers might be \u201c emboldened \u201d to include even more potentially invasive conditions in future tos : <PARA> as exemplified by this comment and answer exchange between sam fiorella and a reader , all of this concern highlights a common modern dilemma : in order for apps to do what they need to do efficiently , they need to be granted a variety of accesses and permissions by users . do we accept that such access will not be used for malicious purposes ( by either the developers or unauthorized third parties ), or do we give up ease of use in exchange for more cumbersome protections ? <PARA> oh for crying out loud ...[ facebook messenger ] needs permission to record audio & video so that you can send an audio or video message . it can \u2019 t do it without you asking it to . <PARA> it can make calls if you ask it to because it links your facebook and local contacts lists . <PARA> it absolutely cannot do these things without you initiating them ! it needs the permission in advance so that when you ask it to do these things , they work . <PARA> thanks for the comment . i would agree that it \u2019 s not facebook messenger \u2019 s intention to record audio or take a photo without being initiated ( e . g ., taking / adding a pic to a text msg ) but once you give permission for the app to do so automatically , what \u2019 s to stop a hacker or other app from doing so ? we have too much blind faith ... that \u2019 s the point i \u2019 m trying to make .",

( most mosquito repellents , despite the nomenclature , don \u2019 t technically \u201c repel \u201d mosquitoes ; they block the receptors on mosquitoes \u2019 antennae for the aspects of human beings \u2014 moisture , warmth , body odor , exhalation of carbon dioxide \u2014 which attract the critters .) deet has been used by many millions of people worldwide for decades , and it \u2019 s considered safe when used according to directions . some concerns have been raised about how safe it might be to use on children , so follow directions carefully when applying deet - laced products to tykes . <PARA> according to the first study to scientifically compare a wide range of products for their effectiveness in repelling mosquitoes , most insect repellents containing herbal oils proved far less effective than those containing deet . this study appeared in the new england journal of medicine in july 2002 . <PARA> mark fradin and jonathan day of the university of florida tested 17 nationally marketed mosquito repelling products under laboratory conditions . they asked 15 volunteers to stick a forearm coated with repellent into a cage containing 10 mosquitoes and observed how much time elapsed before the first bite . products containing deet repelled best , and the more deet they contained , the better they worked . off ! deep woods , which contains 23 . 8 percent deet , provided the longest - lasting protection : 302 minutes on average . by contrast , avon skin - so - soft bath oil failed after 9 . 6 minutes , on average . <PARA> for decades <MASK> has held that skin - so - soft bath oil is an effective counter to mosquitoes , yet a 1993 consumer reports analysis found it ineffective for that purpose . because so many people were buying the product for its purported mosquito combating properties , in 1994 avon added a non - deet repellent and a sunscreen to the popular bath oil and began marketing the new concoction as avon skin - so - soft bug guard repellent . avon disputes the 2002 results posted in the new england journal of medicine study , <MASK> its bug guard repellent works for three hours , not the 10 . 3 minutes for its bug guard repellent ( and the 22 . 9 minutes for its bug guard repellent plus ) the study found , but a 2003 consumer reports analysis found the skin - so - soft repellent deterred mosquitoes for only one hour . <PARA> folks delight in looking for homegrown solutions to various problems . part of this urge is a need to feel in control , and part is a distrust of science , but part is also a recognition that kitchen wisdom has proved right on a number of past occasions . besides , people love feeling they \u2019 ve been entrusted with or have stumbled upon valuable pieces of information unknown to others of their acquaintance .

2015 influenza a ( h3n2 ) vaccine component , but that 52 % were antigenically different ( drifted ) from the h3n2 vaccine virus . in past seasons during which predominant circulating influenza viruses have been antigenically drifted , decreased vaccine effectiveness has been observed . <PARA> in the advisory , the cdc explained to clinicians that the flu vaccine still provided some protection against drifted strains of influenza and that not all strains of flu had drifted . the agency advised health professionals on how to most efficiently protect and treat patients from circulating influenza strains : <PARA> however , vaccination has been found to provide some protection against drifted viruses . though reduced , this cross - protection might reduce the likelihood of severe outcomes such as hospitalization and death . in addition , vaccination will offer protection against circulating influenza strains that have not undergone significant antigenic drift from the vaccine viruses ( such as influenza a ( h1n1 ) and b viruses ). <PARA> because of the detection of these drifted influenza a ( h3n2 ) viruses , this cdc health advisory is being issued to re - emphasize the importance of the use of neuraminidase inhibitor antiviral medications when indicated for treatment and prevention of influenza , as an adjunct to vaccination . <PARA> because of the detection of these drifted influenza a ( h3n2 ) viruses , this cdc health advisory is being issued to re -

2015 flu season , but rather to provide doctors and health professionals with up - to - date information to protect and treat patients . vaccine opponents framed the cdc \u2019 s flu shot health advisory as <MASK> positive the preventive measure was useless , even though the limitations of annual flu vaccines are well documented and thoroughly explained by the agency on its website : <PARA> how well the flu vaccine works ( or its ability to prevent flu illness ) can range widely from season to <MORE> intervention . study results about how well a flu vaccine works can vary based on study design , outcome ( s ) measured , population studied and the season in which the flu vaccine was studied . these differences can make it difficult to compare one study \u2019 s results with another \u2019 s . <PARA> the likelihood that flu vaccine will protect a person from flu illness : 1 ) characteristics of the person being vaccinated ( such as their age and health ), and 2 ) the similarity or \u201c match \u201d between the flu viruses the flu vaccine is designed to protect against and the flu viruses spreading in the community . during years when the flu vaccine is not well matched to circulating viruses , it \u2019 s possible that no benefit from flu vaccination may be observed . during years when there is a good match between the flu vaccine and circulating viruses , it \u2019 s possible to measure substantial benefits from vaccination in terms of preventing flu illness . however , even during years when the vaccine match is very good , the benefits of vaccination will vary across the population , depending on characteristics of the person being vaccinated and even , potentially , which vaccine was used . <PARA> each season researchers try to determine how well flu vaccines work to regularly assess and confirm the value of flu vaccination as a public health intervention . study results about how well a flu vaccine works can vary based on study design , outcome ( s ) measured , population studied and the season in which the flu vaccine was studied . these differences can make it difficult to compare one study \u2019 s results with another \u2019 s . <PARA> simply put , there is no reason the cdc would issue an apology for decreased protection against currently circulating flu strains following any batch of flu vaccine because that isn \u2019 t how flu vaccination works , currently or historically . the objective of flu vaccinations has only ever been to <PARA> protect against the most likely strains for an upcoming flu season , and it is impossible to <MASK> with certainty which strains will circulate in the future . the inability of researchers to completely predict which strains will circulate is a well - documented limitation of flu vaccination , not a hidden drawback of which few are aware . <PARA> furthermore , the cdc has always recommended anyone who is able to receive the flu shot do so . even during flu seasons when the vaccine isn \u2019 t a perfect match , cross - protection against circulating strains of influenza results in fewer instances of severe reactions or deaths from the flu . while no apology was issued by the cdc about the flu shot \u2019 s potentially decreased effectiveness , the agency did advise doctors to more aggressively treat suspected cases of flu with antiviral medications .",

( these things typically make big news .) the first time castro and the trudeaus met face - to - face was a famous trip made by the canadian couple to cuba in 1976 . this event has been chronicled , along with some purportedly saucy comments , in a book that has been cited by <MORE> 8th . when they returned home , margaret moved in with the prime minister for the first time . if ever there were a time to make a baby and have it be born in late december , it would have been then , as hinted at in a harper \u2019 s bazaar profile of margaret : \u201c margaret moved into the prime minister \u2019 s official residence , at 24 sussex drive in ottawa , and gave birth to justin just 10 months after the wedding , on christmas day in 1971 .\u201d <PARA> if that is not enough <MASK> , or if the prospect of a head of <MASK> ( or his spouse ) making secret visits to foreign nations unnoticed sounds plausible , careful examination of the historical record provides little chronologic room to place margaret trudeau and fidel castro together at the time necessary to have conceived the child . upon their return from their honeymoon , the shock of the trudeaus \u2019 marriage ( she was 22 and he was 51 ) put them under intense media scrutiny , making it unlikely the young margaret could slip away to cuba for a tryst unnoticed , since she was now the talk of the town . <PARA> the first couple made a big impression at a local sugaring event , for example , on march 27 , and the press ( in a testament to the level of scrutiny the prime minister \u2019 s new wife received ) noted that margaret did not travel with pierre on an april trip to the niagara region : <PARA> for the remainder of april , pierre was busy with governing , as attested to by logs of the canadian house of commons , making unlikely that his work would take the couple anywhere near havana . <PARA> fidel castro , for his part , was in cuba during this conception window . in terms of public appearances , castro gave a address to attendees of the \u201c first education and culture congress \u201d on 1 april 1971 . on 19 april , he gave a defiantly anti - american speech that commemorated the 10th anniversary of the defeat of the united <MASK> \u2010 sponsored bay of pigs invasion . <PARA> there is no reason to think , or <MASK> to support the notion , that margaret trudeau met castro before 1971 , and there is no plausible circumstance during which a meeting between fidel castro and margaret trudeau could have occurred during the biologically necessary time that accommodates their known public schedules . even the <MASK> poster of the reddit thread seemed to cede this point : <PARA> that would be an <MASK> . the most plausible explanation remains that , soon after marrying , honeymooning , and moving in together after years of keeping their relationship secret , pierre and margaret trudeau had sex and created a child who would one day become another canadian prime minister .",

        "text": "on 15 august 2017 , the disreputable web site yournewswire posted a <MASK> purporting to <MASK> an \u201c anonymous \u201d police officer saying that law enforcement in charlottesville , virginia had been instructed not only to \u201c stand down \u201d during a violent white supremacist rally , but to instigate violence by purposely bringing rival groups together in order to start a race war . <PARA> yournewswire dives deep into conspiracy territory , <MASK> the chaos at the weekend rally was instigated by the \u201c deep <MASK> ,\u201d as well as former president barack obama and former democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton : <PARA> the web site <MASK> a supposed anonymous police officer as saying : <PARA> we found no <MASK> the supposed <MASK> being shared on the internet and featured by yournewswire is authentic , and because it \u2019 s not only unattributed but vague , we have no way of tracing it . however it only appears on yournewswire and other junk sites that cite yournewswire , a web site that regularly posts unfounded conspiracy theories . <PARA> violence did plague the city of charlottesville through the weekend of 11 august 2017 , as protests , general unrest , and street brawls broke out surrounding the \u201c unite the right \u201d white supremacist rally . one woman was killed when a rally attendee reportedly purposely rammed his car into a crowd of counter - demonstrators , and two <MASK> police officers lost their lives when the helicopter they were flying to monitor the unrest crashed . <PARA> however we were able to confirm via a freedom of information act request that no official \u201c stand down \u201d order was given . <PARA> the <MASK> seems to have its roots in a 12 august 2017 tweet posted by the virginia chapter of the american civil liberties union , which cited an unnamed police officer saying law enforcement would wait for a \u201c command \u201d before intervening in street clashes : <PARA> the same day , investigative news outlet propublica published a <MASK> reporting police inaction in the face of violence : <PARA> on 14 august 2017 , fox news reporter doug mckelway <MASK> to have a specific police source that told him officers were ordered not to engage . he said : <PARA> despite the critique by some that police didn \u2019 t do enough to quell violence , both police chief al thomas and city spokeswoman miriam dickler said no such order was issued . we filed a foia seeking any records documenting such an order by either the city , or by any agency outside the city to charlottesville police and received this response : <PARA> dickler explained to us why the <MASK> that the mayor issued a stand - down order which police were required to obey is not possible : the city operates under a council - manager form of municipal government , meaning the city manager functions as the executive . under this system , the mayor is selected by the city council , not voters . the role rotates and is mostly ceremonial in its duties . thus , charlottesville mayor michael signer would not have had the authority to issue a \u201c stand - down \u201d order to the police . <PARA> in the months following the deadly weekend , the city commissioned an independent review of the response to the white supremacist rally by the law firm hunton & williams , lead by former u . s . attorney timothy heaphy . the scathing report released 1 december 2017 is heavily critical of the city \u2019 s response and faults police for failing to prevent much of the violence with flawed planning and coordination that produced \u201c disastrous \u201d results . the report found that the failure of police to quell violence and block traffic while pedestrians fought and marched allowed for tragedy to strike : <PARA> the report further alleges charlottesville police command staff deleted text messages relevant to the review and two people \u2014 a police captain and the chief \u2019 s personal assistant \u2014 told investigators that thomas said that allowing people to fight in the streets would facilitate the declaration of an unlawful assembly , which would make it a crime for anyone to remain in the area : <PARA> thomas \u2019 s attorney kevin martingayle said the chief does not recall making that <MASK> . <PARA> the report doesn \u2019 t find <MASK> that a \u201c stand down \u201d order was explicitly given \u2014 but it does say that the city and authorities failed to keep the peace and protect the safety of the community despite having a visibly large police presence :",

        "text": "<MASK> are a common feature of online political debate , and <MASK> comparisons can often be a powerful rhetorical tool , especially if they are striking or unexpected \u2014 thereby forming the basis of eye - catching and \u201c shareable \u201d social media memes . <PARA> at the end of 2018 , one such meme sought to force readers to reevaluate their perception of various risks and harms in american society , arguing that when it comes to sheer fatalities , terrorism and the consequences of illegal immigration pale in comparison to a lack of affordable healthcare . the left - leaning \u201c teanderthal party \u201d facebook page posted a meme which contained the <MASK> that \u201c more americans die every year from lack of affordable healthcare than from terrorist attacks and illegal immigration combined \u201d: <PARA> terrorist attacks are relatively very rare events in the united <MASK> and in recent years have resulted in a relatively very small number of fatalities . no single , universally - accepted definition of a terrorist attack exists , but the term \u2019 s distinguishing characteristic is that , roughly speaking , it describes an attack driven by some cause ( e . g ., political , religious , environmental ) rather than a criminal motive or personal grievance . <PARA> furthermore , except in cases of assassination , the victims of terrorist acts are typically not known or individually targeted in advance . they are either arbitrary ( for example the passengers of a commercial jet converted into a weapon by al - qaeda operatives and used to destroy the world trade center ) or part of a group which is symbolically targeted ( for example , worshippers at the sikh temple of wisconsin , where a neo - nazi assailant shot dead six people on the basis of their perceived religious faith , in 2012 ). <PARA> the federal bureau of investigation ( fbi ) defines terrorist acts as falling into two categories : <PARA> a couple of unofficial but robust sources of data on deaths from terrorist attacks in the united <MASK> have been active in recent years . the first is the national consortium for the study of terrorism and responses to terrorism ( start ), which is linked to the department of homeland security and led by the university of maryland .; <PARA> according to start figures , between 1995 and 2017 show 3 , 516 deaths associated with 694 terrorist attacks of all varieties ( international and domestic ), yielding a mean ( average ) of 153 deaths per year . however , around 3 , 000 of those fatalities were associated with a single set of events : the al - qaeda attacks of 11 september 2001 . <PARA> in order to find out what the typical number of deaths per year was during this period , we must calculate the median , a type of average that strips away the impact of outliers such as <MORE> introduction of affordable health insurance in massachusetts in 2007 prevented one death for every 830 individuals who became insured under the program . <PARA> using the same 2014 study as their basis , president obama \u2019 s council of economic advisers estimated in december 2016 that the provisions of the affordable care act were saving around 24 , 000 lives per year . <PARA> others have pointed out the flaws in such estimates , not least the difficulty in precisely attributing a lack of health insurance as the primary direct cause of a particular individual \u2019 s death . in particular , a 2009 study in the journal health services research concluded that : \u201c adjusted for demographic , health <MASK> , and health behavior characteristics , the risk of subsequent mortality is no different for uninsured respondents than for those covered by employer \u2010 sponsored group insurance ...\u201d in other words , the study found that lack of health insurance did not cause any otherwise avoidable premature deaths . <PARA> however , another study that challenged the methodology of earlier estimates and found them to be excessively high still arrived at the conclusion that those who could not afford private health insurance were 3 . 7 percent more likely to suffer an avoidable death than those who had private health insurance , a ratio that would equate to a significant number of avoidable deaths per year on a national level . <PARA> it does seem unlikely that the unavailability of affordable healthcare to many u . s . residents accounts for fewer than 1 , 000 deaths each year \u2014 the very high estimate we arrived at as the combined number of deaths attributable to acts of terrorism and homicides perpetrated by undocumented immigrants . <PARA> it is also undoubtable that terrorist acts and homicides committed by undocumented immigrants account for a relatively very small portion of all violent deaths in the united <MASK> , and certainly a smaller share than might appear to be the case , based on the intense media and political scrutiny they attract . <PARA> however , it \u2019 s unlikely that any research model could arrive at a definitive estimate of the number of people who die premature and avoidable deaths each year as a result of their inability to access health insurance . this is partly due to the inherent complexities and ambiguities involved in that question . <PARA> furthermore , we must take into account the absence of uniformly - accepted estimates on the number of fatalities caused by the lack of affordable healthcare , and the existence of at least one peer - reviewed study which concluded that lacking insurance did not cause any substantive difference in the number of deaths . <PARA> for those reasons , we give a mixed verdict to the <MASK> in the meme , that \u201c more americans die every year from lack of affordable healthcare than from terrorist attacks and illegal immigration combined .\u201d",

        "text": "<MASK> : many commonplace objects are said to be inherently imbued with luck , good or ill , so it should not astonish us that one particular denomination of currency , the $ 2 bill , has attracted its own measure of superstition . <PARA> clerks have been known to refuse them ( and not because they thought the bills counterfeit , as in the famed taco bell <MASK> ) \u2014 theirs was an aversion to handling something believed cursed with ill fortune . the taboo against the $ 2 bill runs throughout north america but is not spread evenly ; in some communities its presence is quite <PARA> strong , in others almost non - existent . in the 1970s , for example , you \u2019 d have been hard pressed to find a canadian $ 2 bill anywhere in the province of alberta because one practically couldn \u2019 t give them away there . <PARA> american $ 2 bills were first issued as legal tender notes in 1862 . contrary to what is commonly believed , the $ 2 bill has not been removed from circulation in the usa . according to the u . s . treasury , as of 28 february 1999 , $ 1 , 166 , 091 , 458 worth of u . s . $ 2 bills were in circulation worldwide . in canada , the $ 2 bill was replaced with the \u201c toonie ,\u201d canada \u2019 s two - dollar coin ( also known as \u201c the queen with the bear behind \u201d because it bears an engraving of queen elizabeth ii on one side and a bear on the other ) in 1996 . <PARA> two - dollar bills have never been popular . in 1925 the u . s . government made an unsuccessful attempt to popularize them by inserting one in each pay envelope given to federal employees . several newspapers offered to aid in the campaign by giving prizes for two - dollar bills containing certain serial numbers . the post office department , however , pronounced this practice a lottery and therefore a violation of the postal laws . <PARA> those who shy from the $ 2 bill give a variety of reasons for their antipathy : <PARA> the reasoning here is flawed : just because a thing costs two dollars does not mean exact change must be used to pay for it . besides , a gent who \u2019 d just engaged the services of a hooker wouldn \u2019 t be returning home with the telltale $ 2 bill in his wallet , because he would have just spent it . ( and yes , in the 1930s two dollars would have bought you a five - minute interlude with the gal of your choice at a low - end brothel . fellows generally left their shoes on during those quick encounters .) <PARA> it would be naive to believe vote selling never went on , but that does not necessarily mean two dollars was the standard price for a vote or that , even if it were , the wage was paid with a $ 2 bill rather than two singles ( or , much more likely , two silver dollars ). <PARA> although $ 2 was the most common amount to bet on the ponies , the parimutuel nature of racing \u2019 s betting system meant that winners didn \u2019 t receive exactly the amount they bet : a successful $ 2 bettor would be paid $ 4 . 30 or $ 8 . 40 or $ 10 . 70 or some other amount , depending upon the odds established for the various horses in the race at post time . that some bettors may have used $ 2 bill to place their bets doesn \u2019 t mean everyone \u2019 s winnings were paid in $ 2 bills . <PARA> aside from ladies of the night , horse races , and bought votes , another reason given as the likely source of the $ 2 bill \u2019 s perceived unsavory aspect stems from its most common name : \u201c deuce \u201d is one of the many slang terms for the devil ( as in , \u201c the deuce you say !\u201d). <PARA> whatever the cause , $ 2 bills are widely considered unlucky . for those troubled by this association , superstition offers a counter to two - dollar ill luck : tear a corner from the bill . some who hold this view assert that one must discard the bill once all its corners are gone , but we don \u2019 t hold such extreme views . <PARA> barbara \u201c two for the road \u201d mikkelson",

        "text": "in april 2019 , a legislative proposal in the <MASK> of texas garnered nationwide attention , including in the form of a widely - shared meme posted by the \u201c other 98 %\u201d facebook page , which <MASK> that \u201c texas is considering the death penalty for women who have an abortion . they are now so \u2018 pro - life \u2019 they want to kill you \u201d: <PARA> it is <MASK> that in the first few months of 2019 , members of the texas house of representatives considered and debated a bill which would have redefined a \u201c living child \u201d to include fertilized eggs , and had the effect of completely outlawing abortion by amending <MASK> law on assault and homicide . <PARA> in texas , it is punishable by death to murder a child aged under 10 years , and since the proposed legislation would have reconstituted abortion as the murder of a living child , it is therefore <MASK> to say texas lawmakers did indeed debate and consider a bill which would have had the effect of making abortions punishable by death . <PARA> however , the bill \u2019 s passage through the texas legislature appeared to have come to an abrupt end on 10 april 2019 , shortly after the \u201c other 98 %\u201d published the meme , when a republican committee chairman announced he would not allow the bill to advance beyond the committee . <PARA> republican house member tony tinderholt introduced house bill 896 ( h . b . 896 ) on 17 january , with his republican house colleagues mike lang and valoree swanson joining as co - authors of the bill , on 26 february . on 25 february , the bill was referred to the house committee on judiciary and civil jurisprudence . <PARA> on 10 april , that committee \u2019 s chairman , republican house member jeff leach , announced that h . b . 896 would not advance out of the committee , a move which effectively killed the bill : <PARA> the legislation proposed making several changes to existing texas law , with the intention of redefining a \u201c living child \u201d to include a fertilized egg and completely outlawing abortion in the <MASK> of texas . <PARA> criminal homicide and assault <PARA> chapter 19 of the texas penal code sets out the <MASK> \u2019 s law on criminal homicide , defining and outlining the punishments for murder , manslaughter , criminally negligent homicide , and so on . <PARA> sec . 19 . 06 of that code creates an exception for abortion , <MASK> that the law on criminal homicide does not apply where the death of an unborn child is brought about by the child \u2019 s mother , or by a licensed physician as part of a medical procedure . however , h . b . 896 would have explicitly reversed this exception , asserting that the law on criminal homicide \u201c applies to the death of an unborn child regardless of whether the conduct charged \u201d was committed by a mother or took place as part of a medical procedure . <PARA> sec . 19 . 03 of the penal code <MASK> that where an attacker \u201c murders an individual under 10 years of age ,\u201d that murder is a \u201c capital felony ,\u201d punishable by execution . <PARA> by removing the sec . 19 . 06 exception for abortions , h . b . 896 would therefore have had the effect of designating abortion an act of criminal homicide against a child under 10 years of age , effectively introducing the death penalty as a punishment for abortion . in this respect , the \u201c other 98 %\u201d meme and related news reports were accurate . <PARA> chapter 22 of the texas penal code sets out the <MASK> \u2019 s law on assault . sec . 22 . 12 contains an abortion exception to the prohibition on assault which is almost identical to the one found in sec . 19 . 06 of the chapter on criminal homicide . however , h . b . 896 also would have reversed that exception , <MASK> that the ban on assault \u201c applies to conduct charged as having been committed against an individual who is an unborn child , regardless of whether the conduct \u201d was committed by the mother of the unborn child , or was part of a medical procedure . <PARA> notably , h . b . 896 appeared to invite a court challenge against it , <MASK> explicitly that \u201c any federal law , executive order , or court decision that purports to supersede , stay , or overrule this act is in violation of the texas constitution and the united <MASK> constitution and is therefore void .\u201d <PARA> the bill also directed the <MASK> \u2019 s attorney general to ensure the assault and criminal homicide prohibitions on abortion were being enforced by <MASK> agencies \u201c regardless of any contrary federal law , executive order , or court decision .\u201d <PARA> the u . s . supreme court \u2019 s landmark 1973 decision in roe v . wade ruled that a woman \u2019 s right to access an abortion was protected under her constitutionally - enshrined right to privacy . that decision has been the basis for decades of abortion liberalization , but pro - life activists have long sought to force the nation \u2019 s highest court to revisit it . <PARA> as the new york times reported , h . b . 896 \u2019 s attempted outright ban on abortion could be viewed as forming part of a wider pro - life strategy of implementing increasingly stringent abortion restrictions and prompting court challenges which could escalate to the level of a supreme court reversal of roe v . wade :",

        "text": "in the 8 january 2019 run - up to a primetime address by president donald trump on border security and the ongoing government shutdown over that issue , the republican national committee ( rnc ) released a set of seven facts on a page titled \u201c borderfacts . com .\u201d this <MASK> addresses the first <MASK> on that page , which <MASK> ( in full ): \u201c in four customs and border protection sectors where physical barriers have been expanded \u2014 el paso , yuma , tucson , and san diego \u2014 illegal traffic has dropped by at least 90 %.\u201d <PARA> the wording used in that <MASK> was extremely vague . the rnc <MASK> that illegal traffic had dropped by 90 % in four specific sectors which they described as locations \u201c where physical barriers have been expanded ,\u201d implying ( but not directly <MASK> ) that other sectors had seen no expansion of barriers . thanks largely to the secure fence act of 2006 and the dhs appropriations act of 2008 , the mileage of physical barrier along the u . s . southern border with mexico expanded from 119 miles to 654 miles between 2005 and 2015 , according to the nonpartisan government accountability office ( gao ): <PARA> however , this increase in border fencing was not limited solely to the four cbp sectors that the rnc cherry - picked for this <MASK> . both the el centro sector and the rio grande valley sector , the latter of which showed an increase in border apprehensions , also experienced an increase in fencing but were not included in the rnc \u201c fact \u201d. <PARA> the department of homeland security ( dhs ) uses border apprehensions as a marker for attempted crossings , but the rnc did not specify which years they were comparing . the border apprehension figures provided by cbp from 2000 - 2017 and organized in this document show that every sector ( with the exception of the fence - containing rio grande valley ) saw a decline in apprehensions . <PARA> below we have plotted the number of apprehensions at each sector from 2000 - 2017 in the sectors highlighted by the rnc , as well as the ones the rnc left out of their analysis : <PARA> the overall trend along the southern border has broadly been one of declining apprehensions , regardless of fencing or barriers in various sectors . the only section that saw a net increase in border apprehensions over the 2000 - 2017 time period was the rio grande valley , which was also the only sector \u201c where physical barriers have been expanded \u201d that the rnc conveniently omitted from their \u201c fact \u201d. in total , border apprehensions across all sectors dropped 81 % from 2000 - 2017 : <PARA> all that said , the only way to demonstrate a 90 +% decline in apprehensions in each of the sectors highlighted by the rnc is to play around with the years being compared . the only way the el paso sector \u2019 s decline in apprehensions can be made to top 90 %, for example , is by comparing that sector \u2019 s maximum and minimum values rather than the data from the first and final years of the timeframe ( 2000 - 2017 ) in question . <PARA> since the rnc provided no \u201c before \u201d and \u201c after \u201d dates , they were technically free to pick and choose what years they wanted to compare . so to make their case for the el paso sector , they could choose to compare 2005 to 2012 , which yields a 92 % reduction in border apprehensions for that sector . similarly , only a few comparisons make the yuma sector top the 90 % figure , so the rnc could have simply chosen to use the years 2005 and 2011 , which yields a 96 % reduction for that sector . <PARA> the tucson section solidly shows a decline pretty much any way one looks at it , including over the entire 2000 - 2017 period , which yields a 94 % reduction in apprehensions . the san diego sector , on the other hand , requires going back even further than 2000 to make its apparent reduction in apprehensions top 90 %. the highest value achievable within the 2000 - 2017 dataset comes from comparing 2008 to 2017 , which produces an 84 % reduction . <PARA> because of the vaguely worded nature of this \u201c fact ,\u201d one could make the argument that , since the san diego sector was the first sector to experience any wall construction , it would still technically count as a sector \u201c where physical barriers have been expanded \u201d even if one used <MASK> going back all the way back to 1990 , right before the first barrier was completed . that year saw roughly four times as many border apprehensions as year in the 2000 - 2017 dataset , and manipulating the numbers this way results in a 94 % reduction in apprehensions in san diego . <PARA> overall , this \u201c fact \u201d is so vaguely worded that it can be technically <MASK> ( though only by using inconsistent methods for evaluating each sector ) while still being meaningless in terms of demonstrating a border wall \u2019 s efficacy . the overall trend during the past decade has been a significant decline in border apprehensions in nearly all sectors , including some that have had border barriers built / expanded , and some that have not .",

        "text": "in 1997 , a longtime sufferer of alopecia areata founded the now popular charity locks of love to provide children who suffer from hair loss due to medical conditions with high - quality wigs and hairpieces . and since at least 2005 , internet - based <MASK> have circulated <MASK> that the vast majority of hair donated to locks of love is resold to make commercially - vended wigs , that the charity provides very few free hairpieces relative to the volume of hair donated each year , and that most of those wigs aren \u2019 t made actually available to children with cancer . many critics have <MASK> that children lucky enough to receive wigs were charged exorbitant prices and made to endure a rigorous screening process : <PARA> before examining such <MASK> , we have to consider the scope of a charity like locks of love . hair donation charities have a primary function of raising money and providing hairpieces to people who suffer from chronic hair loss , but their secondary purpose is rather unique : while contributing to most other charities requires available cash , locks of love enables anyone who can grow healthy hair to contribute . because of the relatively low barrier to participation , locks of love and similar charitable entities remain popular among children and youth groups seeking to engage in good works . while hair donation is a particularly accessible form of charitable service , the ease of contributing has triggered skepticism and the fear that well - intentioned kids are being hooked and crooked for their good deeds . <PARA> in the march 2015 facebook post <MASK> above , the author <MASK> that locks of love only used a third of donated hair to craft wigs and sold the remaining two thirds to commercial hairpiece makers . locks of love themselves say that as much as 80 % of donated hair isn \u2019 t used to make hairpieces directly , but according to that organization and the wigmaker with whom they work , most donated hair cannot be used because it does not meet the necessary criteria for making hairpieces : <PARA> the interview <MASK> above ( which took place in 2007 ) made mention of the sale of hair to keep the charity running . however , such an admission is not necessarily suspect . as explained earlier , the charity functions in part to convert a resource nearly all can provide ( hair ) into a usable product for children in need . if that need is aided by selling some donated hair to fund manufacturing costs and the charity \u2019 s organizational needs , the charity \u2019 s primary goal ( acquiring and providing hairpieces to children ) is still being served . <PARA> locks of love \u2019 s web site addresses the matter of wig costs to recipients , noting that hairpieces are provided free to families who lack the means to purchase them . for others , the hairpieces are available on a sliding scale of prices depending upon their ability to pay : \u201c we provide hairpieces and repairs free of charge or on a sliding scale based on the financial need of those responsible for the children .\u201d <PARA> also at issue is the matter of who the primary recipients of wigs are . one aspect of <MASK> <MASK> that children with cancer were not primary candidates for locks of love , another thing the charity itself has frequently explained : <PARA> while those looking to donate hair may prefer their donations help cancer sufferers , locks of love was founded by and operates primarily for sufferers of alopecia . this focus of the group does not constitute any subterfuge or lie by omission , as some <MASK> insinuated . the locks of love faq also addresses the sale of hair : <PARA> earlier <MASK> about locks of love <MASK> that the organization failed to account for a vast quantity of donated hair : <PARA> however , a number of factors were elided in that report . the value of donated hair when applied to actual hairpieces provided to children relied on a projection , not actual processing and manufacturing costs . also , locks of love must account for their incoming and outgoing expenses each year in tax filings . if the group truly trafficked heavily in black market hair , significant discrepancies would arise in their accounting books . despite the organization \u2019 s admitted lack of record - keeping in respect to hair received ( for which there is no clear monetary value ), any significant revenues from the sale of hair would have appeared on their ledgers as income . <PARA> the charity auditing page charity navigator rates locks of love favorably , with a total score of 92 . 7 points out of 100 . on the aspect of accountability locks of love scored 92 out of 100 , with more than 92 % of the charity \u2019 s expenses allocated to program costs . less than 7 % of expenses went to administrative costs and salaries , and ceo linda borum \u2019 s most recently listed salary ( for fiscal year 2015 ) was a modest $ 64 , 866 .",

        "text": "u . s . senate minority leader chuck schumer ( d - new york ) is a career politician who cut his teeth in the new york <MASK> assembly before being elected to the u . s . house of representatives in 1981 , where he served nine terms prior to winning a u . s . senate seat in 1998 . <PARA> as the voice of the opposition party in the senate , schumer was frequently at odds with president trump and the republicans . these disputes spilled over into social media , where schumer not only exchanged barbs with the president himself , but was regularly attacked by trump supporters hoping to discredit him . <PARA> in december 2018 , some of trump \u2019 s followers shared posts asserting that schumer had been \u201c caught \u201d accepting excessive campaign contributions and failing to properly disclose expenses in 1998 : <PARA> the proximate source of the accusation appeared to be an 11 december editorial by fox news pundit tucker carlson attempting to refute the argument that trump \u2019 s alleged hush money payments to mistresses during the 2016 presidential campaign constituted grounds for impeachment because they violated campaign finance laws . <PARA> in defense of trump , carlson noted that both barack obama and chuck schumer paid hefty fines to the federal election commission ( fec ) for past campaign violations yet suffered no further legal consequences for their actions ( emphasis added ): <PARA> as we \u2019 ve had occasion to explain before , the hush money payments trump \u2019 s attorney admitted making on his behalf and more routine campaign finance violations such as failing to comply with contribution caps or improperly disclosing expenses bear little similarity . although obama \u2019 s 2008 campaign was indeed fined $ 375 , 000 by the fec for not providing timely notice of contributions exceeding $ 1 , 000 , the violation was not deemed intentional and did not rise to the level of a prosecutable offense . <PARA> neither did the violations alleged in schumer \u2019 s case rise to the level of a prosecutable offense , as enumerated in an fec audit report released to the public in april 2001 . the figures cited by carlson roughly matched those contained in a summary of the audit published that may : <PARA> as noted by the fec , the larger figure ($ 6 , 354 , 835 in improperly disclosed disbursements , characterized as \u201c expenses \u201d) comprised amounts that were erroneously reported as lump sum entries instead of being broken out by date and amount as required . the error was subsequently corrected . <PARA> it \u2019 s misleading to say that schumer was \u201c caught \u201d taking excessive campaign contributions . the contributions were categorized by the fec as such on a technicality : schumer \u2019 s campaign failed to comply with a rule ( later dropped from fec regulations ) stipulating that checks accepted from joint bank accounts be signed by both account holders . a small fraction of those donations were duly refunded , leaving an outstanding $ 854 , 404 in contributions that still met the criteria for being \u201c excessive ,\u201d fec auditors concluded . the schumer campaign committee \u2019 s lawyer affirmed to associated press in april 2003 that : <PARA> for the latter violation , the campaign agreed to pay a fine of $ 130 , 000 ( not $ 138 , 000 , as later <MASK> by carlson and others ). however , the suggestion that the violations and subsequent fine ought to have disqualified from remaining in office is unrealistic and naive . <PARA> \u201c there are always reporting violations in campaigns ,\u201d a former fec commissioner told us in february 2018 . some violations are more serious than others , but even when they result in large civil penalties ( as in the cases of the schumer and obama campaigns ), they are rarely regarded , in the absence of criminal intent , as having any bearing on a candidate \u2019 s fitness to hold office . in 1993 , for instance , the fec fined sen . bob dole \u2019 s ( r - kansas ) 1988 presidential campaign $ 120 , 000 for accepting improper corporate donations and exceeding spending limits , yet dole not only ran for president again but remained in office right up until his retirement in 1996 .",

<PARA> my question to mel gibson is how many million dollars does it look as if you \u2019 re going to make off the crucifixion of christ ? <PARA> according to an associated press account , what pat robertson said about the forthcoming presidential election during a 700 club broadcast doesn \u2019 t quite match the \u201c exact <MASK> \u201d offered by andy rooney at the beginning of his commentary : <PARA> 60 minutes version : \u201c i think george bush is going to win in a wash . i \u2019 m hearing from the lord that it \u2019 s going to be a blow - out .\u201d <PARA> associated press version : \u201c i think george bush is going to win in a walk . i really believe i \u2019 m hearing from the lord it \u2019 s going to be like a blowout election in 2004 . it \u2019 s shaping up that way .\u201d <PARA> associated press version : \u201c i think george bush is going to win in a walk . i really believe i \u2019 m hearing from the lord it \u2019 s going to be like a blowout election in 2004 . it \u2019 s shaping up that way .\u201d <PARA> cbs said this item drew the heaviest audience response to a 60 minutes piece since andy rooney \u2019 s commentaries on the iraq war last spring , and a 60 minutes spokesman reported that the amount of phone calls and e - mail they had received was \u201c several times the normal feedback .\u201d <PARA> on 4 november 2011 , andy rooney passed away at the age of 92 .",

        "text": "this sorrowful tale of the fatal poisoning by oleander sticks used to roast treats over a campfire has been part of the urban legend canon for decades , with many of our readers in the united <MASK> reporting having heard versions of it in the 1960s and even the 1950s . it was also told as a <MASK> , local , and recent tale in the 1970s in australia . <PARA> in fact , the tale is far older . a version of it appears in a gardening book published in england in 1886 , under the entry for \u201c nerium \u201d ( which is another name for this plant ): <PARA> similar is this cite from an 1853 book ( which itself references a 1844 publication ): <PARA> we \u2019 ve no idea how valid those <MASK> from 1886 and 1853 are , but at least these entries grant a far better appreciation of the age of this cautionary tale . <PARA> oleander is a common outdoor woody shrub found in warmer climates , often used for edging freeways or gardens . it is also quite poisonous , with the ingestion of as little as a single leaf reportedly being enough to kill a child . it is a plant worthy of respect even by those who neither have children nor themselves make it their habit to gnaw on shrubbery , as cats and dogs \u2014 and even horses \u2014 have been killed by oleander poisoning . <PARA> according to this well - traveled cautionary tale , the unwitting use of oleander branches or leaves in a campfire brings about the death of a group of people either through roasting sticks fashioned from the plant adding a fatal kick to cookout ingestibles or the leaves or branches used to feed the flames creating a deadly cloud of poisonous smoke . because this is a legend meant to make a point about the danger posed by this particular plant so that those exposed to the tale will afterwards be more careful about their use of plants in the wild , the victims are presented as folks with whom listeners will sympathize : a troop of boy scouts or a vacationing family ( which implies the presence , and thus the demise , of small children ). the use of sympathetic characters makes for a loss deemed especially tragic and adds to the pathos of the <MASK> , which in turn helps ensure that the tale better sticks in memory and so makes for a more effective teaching device . likewise , in this legend the element of horror is raised to the highest possible level in that everyone in the group exposed to the oleander dies : not one boy scout survives the hot dogging , nor does any member of the luckless family live through their exposure to the acrid smoke . all die , as they must if the point is to be made . <PARA> was there ever such an ill - fated family or troop of boy scouts ? though we \u2019 ve searched for news stories about such a tragedy , we haven \u2019 t found any , not even an account of a non - fatal poisoning . death by oleander is rare to begin with , and the cases we \u2019 ve located so far involved direct ingestion of the plant . <PARA> in los angeles in 2001 , a woman suspected of administering a lethal mixture of antifreeze and oleander to her husband was charged with murder . also in los angeles , but in 2000 , two adopted russian boys ( age 3 and 2 ) died from eating oleander leaves off a neighbor \u2019 s hedge . both were found dead in their cribs . their mother said she saw the children chewing the leaves a few days before they died and noticed they had picked some again the night of their deaths . <PARA> how poisonous is poisonous ? oleander ( leaves and branches ) is deemed extremely dangerous , with the poison known to affect the heart , produce severe digestive upset , and to have caused death . the size and relative health of the person ingesting the plant have a great deal to do with the severity of the poisoning . their relatively small body size places children especially at risk , making oleander a plant one may not want in one \u2019 s garden if children are part of the household or live nearby . <PARA> yet could enough of the plant \u2019 s deadly essence be transmitted to a foodstuff during a cooking process that involves skewering the item to be eaten on an oleander stick ? highly unlikely says this 2005 toxicological study :",

        "text": "in the waning years of their lengthy lives , former presidents ( and founding fathers ) john adams and thomas jefferson reconciled the political differences that had separated them for many years and carried on a voluminous correspondence . one of the purposes behind their exchange of letters was to set the record straight regarding the events of the american revolution , for as author joseph j . ellis noted , they ( particularly adams , whom <MASK> would not treat nearly as kindly as jefferson ) were keenly aware of the \u201c distinction between <MASK> as experienced and <MASK> as remembered \u201d: <PARA> evidently adams was right : so great is our need for simplified , dramatic events and heroes that even the real - life biographies of the fifty - six men who risked their lives to publicly declare american independence are no longer compelling enough . through multiple versions of pieces like the one <MASK> below , their lives have been repeatedly embellished with layers of fanciful fiction to make for a better <MASK> : <PARA> as we often do , we \u2019 ll try here to strip away those accumulated layers of fiction and get down to whatever kernel of truth may lie underneath : <PARA> it is <MASK> that five signers of the declaration of independence were captured by the british during the course of the revolutionary war . however , none of them died while a prisoner , and four of them were taken into custody not because they were considered \u201c traitors \u201d due to their <MASK> as signatories to that document , but because they were captured as prisoners of war while actively engaged in military operations against the british . <PARA> george walton was captured after being wounded while commanding militia at the battle of savannah in december 1778 , and thomas heyward , jr ., arthur middleton , and edward rutledge ( three of the four declaration of independence signers from south carolina ) were taken prisoner at the siege of charleston in may in 1780 . although they endured the ill treatment typically afforded to prisoners of war during their captivity ( prison conditions were quite deplorable at the time ), they were not tortured , nor is there <MASK> that they were treated more harshly than other wartime prisoners who were not also signatories to the declaration . moreover , all four men were eventually exchanged or released ; had they been considered traitors by the british , they would have been hanged . <PARA> richard stockton of new jersey was the only signer taken prisoner specifically because of his <MASK> as a signatory to the declaration , \u201c dragged from his bed by night \u201d by local tories after he had evacuated his family from new jersey , and imprisoned in new york city \u2019 s infamous provost jail like a common criminal . <PARA> it is <MASK> that a number of signers saw their homes and <MORE> southeast face of the residence does show <MASK> of damage from cannon fire .\u201d <PARA> francis lewis represented new york in the continental congress , and shortly after he signed the declaration of independence his long island <MASK> was raided by the british , possibily as retaliation for his having been a signatory to that document . while lewis was in philadelphia attending to congressional matters , his wife was taken prisoner by the british after disregarding an order for citizens to evacuate long island . mrs . lewis was held for several months before being exchanged for the wives of british officials captured by the americans . although her captivity was undoubtedly a hardship , she had already been in poor health for some time and died a few years ( not months ) later . <PARA> john hart \u2019 s new jersey farm was looted in the course of the revolutionary war ( possibly due his <MASK> as speaker of the assembly ), and he did have to remain in hiding in nearby mountains for a short time , but the rest of the above passage is gross exaggeration . when the british overran the area of new jersey where hart resided in late november of 1776 , he was not \u201c driven from his [ dying ] wife \u2019 s bedside ,\u201d as his wife had already died several weeks earlier ( and most of his thirteen children were adults by then ). he certainly didn \u2019 t spend \u201c more than a year \u201d on the run living \u201c in forests and caves ,\u201d as the continental army recaptured the area within a month ( through general george washington \u2019 s famous crossing of the delaware river on christmas night ). hart also did not die \u201c from exhaustion and a broken heart \u201d a mere \u201c few weeks \u201d after emerging from hiding \u2014 in 1778 he was re - elected to the new jersey assembly , and he invited the american army to encamp on his new jersey farmland in june 1778 before succumbing to kidney stones in may 1779 . <PARA> lewis morris ( not norris ) indeed saw his westchester county , new york , home taken over in 1776 and used as a barracks for soldiers , and the horses and livestock from his farm commandeered by military personnel , but he suffered those initial deprivations at the hands of the continental army , not the british . shortly afterwards his property was appropriated , looted , and burned by the british when they occupied new york . ( morris and his wife were eventually able to <MASK> their property and restore their home after the war .) <PARA> philip livingston lost several properties to the british occupation of new york and sold off others to support the war effort , and he did not recover them because he died suddenly in 1778 , before the end of the war .",

        "text": "<MASK> : this dubious account first came to us in e - mail in october 2004 . frankly , we don \u2019 t yet know what to make of it \u2014 we \u2019 re as yet unable to locate information about the <MASK> of raising a finger when exiting a house of worship . according to a number of our readers , the practice does indeed take place in some baptist and ame ( african methodist episcopal ) <PARA> houses of worship among those who need to enter or exit during the sermon or at other points in the service where the congregation is being addressed ( e . g .; church announcements , scripture reading ). in those instances , those on their way out or in hold up a finger . the custom seems to be more common among elderly parishioners , a datapoint that serves to indicate the observance hails from an earlier time . <PARA> although the e - mailed account names the area being exited as the \u2018 sanctuary ,\u2019 it is better identified as the nave . a strict definition of \u2018 sanctuary \u2019 as it relates to church buildings describes it as the region around the altar used by the clergy and choir ( often enclosed by a lattice or railing or in some other fashion set off from the congregation ). however , a great number of folks have come to understand the term as meaning the whole of a church \u2019 s open area , both the chancel ( where the service is conducted from ) and the nave ( where the parishioners sit ). <PARA> there are problems with this supposed <MASK> . first , if a master had brought some of his slaves to a public event and seated them in that building \u2019 s balcony , he wouldn \u2019 t have been keeping an eye on them throughout whatever it was he \u2019 d come to see . given that his attention would have been directed towards the figures enacting whatever public affairs drama was underway ( e . g ., political speech , criminal trial ), he wouldn \u2019 t have seen upraised hands among his servants , ensconced as they were on a higher level and probably to the back of him . also , it would have bordered on unthinkable for slaves to risk disrupting public functions with their comings and goings , yet the premise of this <MASK> has it that this practice was so commonplace as to have inspired a widely understood ritual of their raising their hands to seek permission to leave , getting it by way of a nod from their masters , then holding up a finger to signify to others that permission for the act underway had been duly sought and granted . <PARA> holding up a finger as a way of broadcasting certain intelligences is one of the many non - verbal ways we communicate specific messages to others . the gesture described ( index finger pointing upwards , other fingers curled into a loose fist , the palm facing those being signaled , and the hand presented at approximately face height ) conveys three starkly dissimilar interruption - related messages , with context dictating which meaning carries the day . in all three , the raised digit might well represent a \u2018 1 ,\u2019 signaling announcement by the finger - raiser that his request , demand , or absence will not be of lengthy duration ( i . e ., \u201c this will just take one minute , so bear with me \u201d): <PARA> the meaning of the finger raise as practiced among baptist and ame congregations most likely falls into the third category listed above , that of the apologetic excuse , the \u201c whoops , i \u2019 m sorry but i really need to be attending to something else right now , but i promise to be back in two shakes of a lamb \u2019 s tail .\u201d it therefore signals a self - generated act , not a permission gained from another . <PARA> to us , the <MASK> about slaves announcing their absences having been duly sanctioned sounds contrived to make a religious point by way of a pun . just as the \u201c who will take the son ?\u201d legend draws on word play to make its point ( the person who takes the portrait of the deceased son gets the bulk of a wealthy man \u2019 s <MASK> , the person who accepts christ as his savior inherits the kingdom of god \u2014 on both levels they \u201c take the son \u201d), so does this <MASK> turn on \u201c my master has excused me .\u201d what supposedly started as slaves \u2019 way of saying their owners had granted them leave to go relieve themselves now signifies churchgoers have been forgiven by god ; that is , washed clean of their sins by virtue of the services just attended . <PARA> our readers speculate those lifted fingers serve : <PARA> the e - mail about the supposed practice of holding up a finger to communicate one is on a duly sanctioned foray makes the point \u201c which goes to show that you should investigate rituals before you follow them .\u201d an extremely well - traveled urban legend about a cooking secret handed down from generation to generation spins on this same axis . <PARA> barbara \u201c secret squirreled \u201d mikkelson",

mere incidental tactile contact with an item permeated by it wouldn \u2019 t deliver a sufficient quantity to the intended victim \u2019 s system . <PARA> the alkaloids contained in burundanga ( scopolamine and atropine ) are powerful toxins that at lower doses produce dry mouth , dizziness , sweating , and blurred vision , but at high doses can cause delirium and unconsciousness . scopolamine has some legal medical applications , including its use as a treatment for parkinson \u2019 s disease , as a sedative , and as a motion sickness preventive . <PARA> burundanga is said to render its ingesters into disoriented zombies ( awake and talkative but powerless to resist orders ) and is believed to be used by robbers and rapists in colombia to render potential victims tractable . it is sometimes termed a \u201c zombie powder \u201d and is regarded as a date rape drug . at higher doses , the drug can cause disorientation , memory loss , hallucinations , and convulsion , and its effects can last for days . burundanga - drugged victims have reportedly been found days after they \u2019 ve gone missing , wandering aimlessly with no clear idea of what happened to them . those under its influence have been known to empty their bank accounts , and even to act <MORE> business cards gained the appearance of credence when a united kingdom police officer \u2019 s e - mail was circulated outside his department . detective constable simon lofting of essex police forwarded the much - traveled e - mail to intelligence officers to check if it was real , but what he meant strictly as a query somehow leaked to the general public with his signature block attached , thereby making it appear he was confirming the warning . said the essex police of the matter : \u201c the email has been exposed as a hoax . the whole <MASK> , which hints the incident happened in essex , was from an urban myths website and was altered to include a warning from an essex police marine unit officer . anyone who receives it should delete it from their inbox .\u201d <PARA> in july 2010 the following account , which places the assault in kansas city , missouri , and makes no mention of burundanga , began circulating in e - mail : <PARA> as with the case of the \u201c perfume robbers \u201d tale , the dissemination of the \u201c burundanga \u201d legend has been followed by copycat reports of such crimes supposedly taking place , most prominently in houston and kansas city ( as noted above ). in neither did police determine that events occurred as reported , that the reportees were truly the targets of criminals , that the putative victims were sickened by something present on pieces of paper handed to them , or that burundanga ( or any similar drug ) was involved at all . of the latter incident , the kansas city police chief posted the findings of his department \u2019 s investigation and concluded that \u201c it is highly unlikely that such brief skin contact with any type of toxin could produce such a fast response . it \u2019 s more likely the victim suffered anxiety - related symptoms like a panic attack from the stress of the event . it is highly , highly unlikely that there is a man out there handing pieces of paper to women that drug them and render them ill .\u201d <PARA> variations : <PARA> in late november 2017 , a years - old screenshot of a facebook post about criminals and incapacitating drugs began recirculating on social media : <PARA> credited to \u201c angela davidson \u201d and timestamped \u201c 7 hours ago ,\u201d it read : <PARA> as of november 2017 the screenshot had been in circulation for at least three years , and the initial post long deleted . this version combines elements of the burundanga / scopolamine legend with a similar baseless <MASK> about carjackers using $ 100 bills as bait ( popular during the high - traffic holiday season at malls and shopping centers in the united <MASK> ). although both <MASK> are widespread and enduring , no credible reports of any such incident have emerged . <PARA> <!\u2013 <PARA> variations :",

( albright emphasized that he thought the event in question was very worthy and should be allowed to take place at the center , but he saw it as an example of a double standard .) <MORE> .\u201d however , the black voters matter \u2019 s visit had been organized with the assistance of evans , and yet it was still allowed to take place . <PARA> we asked brett why the black voters matter visit was allowed to go ahead despite the involvement of evans , but the bus trip was not , and asked whether he had considered requesting that evans disembark the bus ( given that her involvement was purportedly the source of the county \u2019 s objections ) rather than ordering the seniors to return to the center . again , we did not receive a response to these questions . <PARA> conclusion <PARA> it is <MASK> that on 15 october 2018 , staff at the jefferson county senior center in louisville enacted the instructions of county administrator adam brett by insisting that a group of seniors return to the center after they voluntarily boarded a bus operated on behalf of black voters matter , a voter registration group . <PARA> the leaders of that group characterized the incident as racially - motivated voter suppression , but brett insisted otherwise , <MASK> that the reasons for his order were twofold : the involvement of jefferson county democrats chair diane evans meant that the bus trip constituted \u201c political activity ,\u201d something the county could not allow , and county officials had not vetted black voters matter or the bus operator , creating a potential liability for the county which brett was unwilling to assume . <PARA> however , it must be acknowledged that significant problems exist with the coherence of the twofold rationale outlined by brett . first , it is not clear that jefferson county actually has any legal liability for anything that happens to those who use the center once they have left the center . likewise , it \u2019 s not clear that brett had any legal authority to \u201c not allow \u201d seniors to travel to the polling <MASK> or black voters matter to escort them there . <PARA> second , the consistency with which jefferson county enforces their prohibition on \u201c political activities \u201d at the senior center is questionable . on the one hand , brett forbade the bus trip to the polling <MASK> on this basis due to the involvement of a local democratic official , even though the bus trip would have taken the seniors away from the senior center , and even though the county allowed a visit to the senior center which had been organized with the help of that same democratic official . <PARA> but jefferson county \u2019 s board of commissioners also sanctioned a forthcoming event to be hosted by jody hice , a sitting republican congressman and active election candidate , which is scheduled to take place in the center itself , and the board of commissioners has promoted that event on facebook in a post taken word - for - word from hice \u2019 s earlier press release .",

i don \u2019 t hate christians ,\u201d voldemort lied dishonestly . \u201c what are you even talking about ?\u201d <PARA> \u201c you \u2019 re still pretending to be dumb ,\u201d the reverend pointed out truthfully . \u201c we know all about your plot to illegalize christianity , voldemort .\u201d <PARA> voldemort blinked stupidly again and questioned evilly , \u201c wait , this is about my reddit account ?\u201d <PARA> \u201c is that what you call your godless coven ?\u201d dumbledore queried knowingly . \u201c well yes i have indeed seen your so - called reddit account ; and just try to deny your hatred of christianity when you post things like this -\u2018 kristians all sux . their religion is stoopid and should be illegal . i will rite to congres and tell them to make law .'\u201d <PARA> harry potter laughed intelligently ; because voldemort did not even understand proper spelling and grammar . <PARA> \u201c that was a joke ,\u201d voldemort retorted unintelligently . \u201c that whole account is a joke . i mean , \u2018 voldemort_the_righteous_skeptic \u2019?\u201d he laughed with the nervousness of one who knows he is damned . \u201c of course you \u2019 re not supposed to take it seriously .\u201d <PARA> \u201c do you think religion is a laughing matter young man ?\u201d dumbledore demanded righteously . \u201c well it is not ! what sort of a joke is trying to outlaw religion ?!\u201d <PARA> \u201c of course i don \u2019 t actually want to outlaw religion ,\u201d voldemort uttered deceptively . \u201c that would be ridiculous . i just got annoyed by the ridiculous straw man some christians have made out of atheism , so , whenever i see someone ranting about how depraved and evil we nonbelievers are , i reply with something like that . you know , taking that stereotype to an extreme to point out how ridiculous it is . <PARA> \u201c also , a small but vocal minority of atheists exists that stereotypes and mocks anyone who disagrees with them . they can be just as hateful as people think we all are , and that does real damage . they bug me as much as the straw man arguments do \u2014 and they give those arguments credibility \u2014 so i do the same thing to them , replying with an extreme version of what they said to highlight the absurdity of it .\u201d",

        "text": "humans have been leaving mementos on and within the final resting places of loved ones almost from the beginning of the species . excavations of even the earliest graves uncover goods meant to serve the deceased in the next world , such as pottery , weapons , and beads . but what about coins being left on graves ? <PARA> the earliest known coins date to the late seventh century b . c ., and as societies began embracing such monetary systems , the practice leaving of coins in the graves of citizens began as yet another way of equipping the dear departed for the afterlife . <PARA> mythologies within certain cultures added specific purpose for coins being left with the dead . in greek mythology , charon , the ferryman of hades , required payment for his services . a coin was therefore placed in the mouth of the dear departed to ensure he would ferry the deceased across the rivers styx and acheron and into the world of the dead rather than leave him to wander the shore for a hundred years . in england and the u . s ., pennies were routinely placed on the closed eyes of the dead , yet the purpose for that practice was not clear \u2014 some say it was to keep the eyes of the corpse from flying open ( even though the eyes , once shut by the person laying out the body , do not reopen ). <PARA> in these more recent days , coins and other small items are sometimes discovered on grave markers , be they plaques resting atop the sod or tombstones erected at the head of the burial plot . these small tokens are left by visitors for no greater purpose than to indicate that someone has visited that particular grave . it has long been a tradition among jews , for example , to leave a small stone or pebble atop a headstone just to show that someone who cared had stopped by . coins ( especially pennies ) are favored by others who wish to demonstrate that the deceased has not been forgotten and that instead his loved ones still visit him . <PARA> sometimes these small remembrances convey meaning specific to the person buried in that plot . for more than twenty years , every month someone has been leaving one campbell \u2019 s tomato soup can and a pocketful of change on the plain black granite tombstone that marks the grave of andy warhol . the soup can is easy to explain , given warhol \u2019 s iconic use of that commodity in his art , but the handful of change remains a bit of a mystery . in similar vein , visitors often leave pebbles , coins and maple leaf pins at the grave of canadian prime minister lester b . pearson , the man who replaced canada \u2019 s red ensign with the maple leaf flag . <PARA> regarding the \u2018 tradition \u2019 of soldiers leaving on the headstones of fallen comrades varying denominations of coins to denote their relationship with the deceased , the earliest reference to this practice we \u2019 ve found so far dates only to june 2009 , when it appeared as a web site post . a version now commonly circulated in e - mail appears to have been drawn from it , albeit some changes have slipped in , such as \u201c a buddy who served in the same outfit , or was with the deceased when he died , might leave a quarter \u201d becoming \u201c by leaving a quarter at the grave , you are telling the family that you were with the soldier when he was killed \u201d: <PARA> despite the <MASK> of this tradition dating back to the days of the roman empire , there \u2019 s no reason to suppose that it does . a coin might be placed in the mouth of a fallen roman soldier ( to get him across the river styx ), but the deceased \u2019 s comrades would more likely have been expending any further coinage on a funeral banquet in his honor rather than interring it with his remains . given the lack of documentation attesting to the <MASK> and consistency of this \u2018 tradition ,\u2019 it is perhaps best regarded not as an actual common practice but instead as someone \u2019 s idealized legend of what should be . <PARA> yet military folk do sometimes leave very special remembrances at the graves of deceased servicemen : challenge coins . these tokens identify their bearers as members of particular units and are prized and cherished by those to whom they have been given ; thus any challenge coins found at gravesites were almost certainly left there by comrades - in - arms of the deceased . <PARA> it needs be mentioned that not only coins , medallions , and stones have been found on military headstones . in july 2013 , a wife of a deceased serviceman discovered another woman \u2019 s name on her husband \u2019 s marker in place of her own . edna fielden , widow of air force master sergeant billy fielden ( buried at fort logan cemetery in denver 25 years earlier ) was shocked to discover the headstone bore the inscription \u201c dolores \u201d over the legend \u201c his wife \u201d when she brought her grandchildren to visit the grave . <PARA> update : in early 2021 , coins on graves was the subject of a number of online advertisements . one of the ads read : \u201c[ pics ] here \u2019 s why you should never , ever touch coins left on a gravestone .\u201d another <MASK> : \u201c[ pics ] if you see coins placed on a gravestone , here \u2019 s what it means .\u201d both ads led to lengthy slideshow <MASK> .",

        "text": "in the introduction to his 2000 biography of john hancock , historian harlow giles unger noted that : <PARA> it is indeed one of the quirks of <MASK> that john hancock \u2014 one of colonial america \u2019 s most ardent revolutionaries and greatest philanthropists , a nine - term governor of massachusetts , president of the continental congress , the first signer of the declaration of independence \u2014 is so little - known to americans . sure , we know his name because of his large , bold signature , prominent above all others on the declaration of independence , but we don \u2019 t know much about hancock the man , and we don \u2019 t generally rank him among the pantheon of america \u2019 s founding fathers as we do men such as george washington , thomas jefferson , and benjamin franklin . <PARA> perhaps because we know so little about hancock the man , we \u2019 ve invented legends about him to explain how his name came to be front and center on the declaration of independence , the largest and clearest signature on the document , smack in the middle of the top row . it was an act of defiance , we \u2019 ve decided \u2014 a bold stroke by a bold man who challenged the british to come and get him , and who by so doing instilled confidence and courage in the colonial delegates who followed his lead and affixed their names to the declaration as well , even though they risked being hanged for treason by doing so : <PARA> john hancock was an extremely rich man who risked much of his fortune on the success of the revolution , who had a price on his head , and who practically guaranteed by signing the declaration that he would be hanged by the british if caught , but none of those factors explains his prominent signature on the declaration . the tales about the defiant exclamations he supposedly uttered while signing that document are based on a couple of common historical misconceptions : that the purpose of the declaration of independence was to serve formal notice upon george iii that the american colonies were officially declaring themselves to be independent <MASK> ( something akin to a modern day declaration of war ), and that all the delegates to the continental congress signed the famous parchment copy of the declaration on july 4 , 1776 . <PARA> the declaration of independence was not addressed to king george , nor was a copy delivered to him by colonial representatives ( although there was little doubt that he would eventually see it ). the purpose of the declaration was for the continental congress to explain to the american colonists whom they represented why they felt it necessary to break with great britain , and to justify their actions to the rest of the world . the declaration blames \u201c the present king of great britain <MORE> in the declaration would be tantamount to recognizing that body \u2019 s authority to rule the colonies . <PARA> moreover , despite the impression created by john trumbull \u2019 s famous painting of the event , the delegates to the continental congress did not sign the familiar parchment document now on exhibit in the u . s . national archives on the day it was adopted , july 4 , 1776 , and thus there was no need for hancock to spur them on by being the first to take that bold step . when congress adjourned on july 4 after having debated the declaration for three days and having voted to adopt the document with some revisions , hancock \u2014 as president of that body \u2014 was charged with authenticating the revised document so that copies could be printed as broadsides and sent to the colonial legislatures for approval and distribution to the continental army . those broadsides bore the names of only hancock and charles thomson , the secretary of the continental congress , set in type ; john hancock \u2019 s eventually famous signature did not appear on this document . <PARA> the \u201c official \u201d signed version of the declaration , known as the engrossed or parchment copy , wasn \u2019 t produced until well after july 4 , when someone ( likely timothy matlack , assistant to the secretary of congress ) wrote out a \u201c clean \u201d copy incorporating all of the continental congress \u2019 amendations . that document was signed by most of the delegates on 2 august 1776 , but the event was so unmemorable that no one present jotted down any observations of it at the time , and it wasn \u2019 t until more than a hundred years later that a historian finally discovered the actual date of the signing . thus there is no record of hancock \u2019 s having made any of pithy or bold remarks ascribed to him upon that occasion , nor of benjamin franklin \u2019 s having uttered the inspiring proclamation that \u201c we must all hang together , or most assuredly we shall hang separately \u201d \u2014 those legendary phrases didn \u2019 t appear in histories and biographies until well after the fact . <PARA> congress kept the identities of the signatories secret for several months to protect them from being charged with treason , so john hancock and others did run a great risk for affixing their names to that document . however , hancock typically signed his name in the fancy , large script so familiar to us , and the reason his name appears in the middle of the top row of the declaration is because he was president of the continental congress at the time the document was approved and adopted . but he was much more than a man with a fancy signature , and his legend is a fascinating and admirable <MASK> without the need for embellishment .",

only under duress ( and an insistence on absolute secrecy ) does a tim hortons executive disclose to the treating doctor a list of the ingredients in their \u201c special blend \u201d \u2014 a list that reveals the presence of nicotine . variants of the basic <MASK> assert it \u2019 s not the coffee itself that \u2019 s loaded with nicotine , but the chain \u2019 s coffee filters or that nicotine has been sprayed on the inside of its disposable cups . <PARA> but tim hortons coffee does not include nicotine , msg , an usually high level of caffeine , or any similar additives . just as the usa has its food and drug administration ( fda ) to oversee the safety of commercially - sold ingestibles , so canada has its canadian food inspection agency ( cfia ). <MORE> relatively small amounts . those who wear nicotine patches must exercise great care about the disposal of their used patches lest children or pets come in contact with the seemingly \u201c spent \u201d aids and become deeply sickened or even possibly die . not surprisingly , nicotine is not permitted as a food additive in either canada or the u . s . <PARA> as for msg , although the fda has designated the additive \u201c generally recognized as safe ,\u201d many people <MASK> to experience adverse effects ( such as headaches ) after ingesting it , so all consumables containing the substance have to be clearly labelled to indicate its presence . <PARA> the \u201c nicotine additive \u201d <MASK> does not adhere solely to tim hortons ; it has been kited about other business concerns whose products have proved to be highly ( and some would say inexplicably ) popular : <PARA> in another form the <MASK> has been known to take , evil - intentioned companies or heartless universities are said to be slipping laxatives into their food to lessen the effects of food poisoning : <PARA> in yet another form of the basic <MASK> , conscienceless fast food companies have been incorporating anti - emetics into their offerings to help patrons keep their food down : <PARA> a blow to the heart of the <MASK> in all its <MASK> is that extraneous chemicals could not be surreptitiously slipped into any company \u2019 s ingestible products without leaving that concern open to a stream of customer lawsuits . in the case of nicotine , the number of wrongful death suits filed would be unimaginable , given that it wouldn \u2019 t take much of that particular poison to kill someone . as for msg , caffeine , laxatives , or anti - emetics , there is no substance so innocuous that it won \u2019 t provoke allergic or violent physical reactions in some people . whatever small advantage a company might gain by adding a little extra something that would addict clients to its offerings would be quickly offset by multi - million dollar losses in civil court and a loss of consumer confidence in the even higher court of public opinion . folks ain \u2019 t going to patronize a place known for killing or sickening its customers , no matter how good the coffee . <PARA> the tim hortons <MASK> reached such prominence that in february 2004 the cbc news program disclosure conducted its own investigation , one which included having samples of coffee from tim hortons ( and a couple of competing chains ) sent to a laboratory for analysis . the results : tim hortons coffee contained no measurable amount of nicotine and had , on average , less caffeine than coffee from either starbucks or second cup . <PARA> tim hortons \u2019 loyal customer base was built the old - fashioned way : good product served fresh in easily - accessible locations .",

page report read : <PARA> as the excerpt above clarified , the dhs oig \u2019 s report examined \u201c aviation workers \u201d ( a broad category spanning airline employees , airport contract workers , and vendors ), not dhs personnel : lynch \u2019 s comments implied the workers were directly under the employ of the dhs rather than its tsa sub - agency ( which was <MASK> part of the department of transportation ). moreover , those 73 aviation workers were described as \u201c individuals with terrorism - related category codes ,\u201d which appeared slightly more nuanced than the <MASK> they were on \u201c the terrorist watch list .\u201d determining the specifics of those codes is difficult , as portions of the report were redacted for security purposes . it \u2019 s possible that congressman lynch was privy to information that provided additional relevant context for his assertion , but his broader <MASK> was still misleading . <PARA> it is also worth noting that the report held that the tsa \u2019 s comprehensive screening process was \u201c generally effective ,\u201d and that aviation workers were subject to multiple checks against the consolidated terrorist watchlist . the report did , however , maintain that the tsa lacked the ability to fully vet aviation workers and recommended that the agency partner with the dhs to \u201c formalize a request to the watchlisting interagency committee through its screening coordination office .\u201d many portions of the report were repetitive , and it included several mentions of the tsa \u2019 s lack of legal authorization to execute \u201c recurrent criminal <MASK> vetting \u201d ( with some exceptions ). <PARA> given lynch \u2019 s <MASK> , one outside possibility was that he referenced an entirely separate audit that was not made public , but the number of individuals and tsa - specific details he cited indicated otherwise . it appeared that lynch conflated dhs employees with aviation workers subject to tsa security clearances , whose terrorism - related category codes went unnoticed due to inter - agency bureaucracy . <PARA> on 2 june 2015 , abc news reported that acting tsa administrator melvin carraway ( not a dhs director , as lynch <MASK> ) was reassigned due to the dhs oig \u2019 s findings . moreover , most news reports cited separate security breaches unrelated to aviation worker screening as the reason for that reassignment : <PARA> the above - linked cbs <MASK> also reported that carraway \u2019 s reassignment was not due to findings that related to improper aviation worker vetting , but rather a separate investigation that targeted the effectiveness of tsa agents : <PARA> <MASK> published : 7 december 2015",

        "text": "virus : heartbleed <PARA> <MASK> : in april 2014 came the announcement that a bug in software used by millions of web servers may have exposed many web sites \u2019 users to spying and eavesdropping , including the interception of their passwords and other account information the bug , dubbed \u201c heartbleed ,\u201d resides in a software library called openssl that is used in servers , operating systems , email , and instant messaging systems . ironically , this software is supposed to protect sensitive data as it travels back and forth . <PARA> \u201c heartbleed \u201d allows hackers to easily trick servers running openssl into revealing decryption keys stored on their memory . with those keys , the ill - intentioned can eavesdrop on encrypted communications , directly steal sensitive information , and impersonate users and services . <PARA> openssl is employed in the widely used apache and nginx server software . <PARA> <MASK> from net monitoring firm netcraft suggest that about 500 , 000 of the web \u2019 s secure servers are running versions of the vulnerable software . ( the bug gained its \u201c heartbleed \u201d moniker due to its occurring in the heartbeat extension for openssl .) <PARA> the bug was discovered by researchers working for google and security firm codenomicon . in a blog entry about their findings , the researchers said the \u201c serious vulnerability \u201d allowed anyone to read chunks of memory in servers running the flawed version of openssl . via this route , attackers could get at the secret keys used to scramble data as it passes between a server and its users . <PARA> the bug has been present in versions of openssl that have been available for over two years . the latest version of openssl released on 7 april 2014 is no longer vulnerable to the bug . however , protecting a server from this vulnerability may not be merely a matter of installing the updated version of openssl : if attackers had exploited the weakness at an earlier date , they could have already stolen the encryption keys , passwords , or other credentials required to access accounts on that server . <PARA> full protection might require web site operators \u2019 updating to the safer version of openssl as well as getting new security certificates and generating new encryption keys . to help operators check their systems , security researchers have produced tools that will determine if servers are running vulnerable versions of openssl . <PARA> unfortunately , as security experts have noted , there is not much that individual internet users can do to protect themselves against the heartbleed vulnerability , as resolution of the issue depends upon the operators of web sites making changes to their systems : <PARA> security experts warn there is little internet users can do to protect themselves from the recently uncovered \u201c heartbleed \u201d bug that exposes data to hackers , at least not until exploitable websites upgrade their software . <PARA> \u201c there is nothing users can do to fix their computers ,\u201d said mikko hypponen , chief research officer with security software maker f - secure . <PARA> hypponen said computer users could immediately change passwords on accounts , but they would have to do so again if their operators notify them that they are vulnerable . <PARA> \u201c take care of the passwords that are very important to you ,\u201d he said . \u201c maybe change them now , maybe change them in a week . and if you are worried about your credit cards , check your credit card bills very closely .\u201d <PARA> bruce schneier , a well - known cryptologist and chief technology officer of co3 systems , called on internet firms to issue new certificates and keys for encrypting internet traffic , which would render stolen keys useless . <PARA> that will be time - consuming , said barrett lyon , chief technology officer of cybersecurity firm defense . net inc . \u201c there \u2019 s going to be lots of chaotic mess ,\u201d he said . <PARA> mark maxey , a director with cybersecurity firm accuvant , said it is no easy task for large organizations to implement the multiple steps to clean up the bug , which means it will take some a long time to do so . <PARA> \u201c there is nothing users can do to fix their computers ,\u201d said mikko hypponen , chief research officer with security software maker f - secure . <PARA> hypponen said computer users could immediately change passwords on accounts , but they would have to do so again if their operators notify them that they are vulnerable . <PARA> \u201c take care of the passwords that are very important to you ,\u201d he said . \u201c maybe change them now , maybe change them in a week . and if you are worried about your credit cards , check your credit card bills very closely .\u201d <PARA> bruce schneier , a well - known cryptologist and chief technology officer of co3 systems , called on internet firms to issue new certificates and keys for encrypting internet traffic , which would render stolen keys useless . <PARA> that will be time - consuming , said barrett lyon , chief technology officer of cybersecurity firm defense . net inc . \u201c there \u2019 s going to be lots of chaotic mess ,\u201d he said . <PARA> mark maxey , a director with cybersecurity firm accuvant , said it is no easy task for large organizations to implement the multiple steps to clean up the bug , which means it will take some a long time to do so . <PARA> additional information :",

        "text": "actual occurrences can sometimes take on folkloric lives of their own , making the shift from news stories to cautionary tales through emotional responses to elements of those events . that was the case with the 4 june 1999 death of 12 - year - old catherine \u201c casey \u201d fish , who did indeed die while playing the marshmallow - stuffing game known as \u201c chubby bunny \u201d \u2014 descriptions of her death have become part of the cautionary lore spread among parents . <PARA> the rules of \u201c chubby bunny \u201d require competitors to enunciate that phrase with marshmallows stuffed in their mouths . no swallowing or chewing is allowed , and any participant who gags , coughs , or spits is \u201c out \u201d of the game . the winner is whichever child manages to utter the expression through the largest number of marshmallows . <PARA> casey fish choked on four marshmallows and collapsed during the annual care fair held at hoffman elementary school , a grade school in chicago \u2019 s north shore area , and died at the glenbrook hospital a few hours later . the \u201c chubby bunny \u201d competition was to have been part of the day \u2019 s activities and would have been supervised by a teacher . however , casey began playing the game with some of her friends when her teacher momentarily left the area ten minutes before the scheduled start of the \u201c chubby bunny \u201d competition to have a word with a janitor . as casey choked , the teacher was summoned back to the room , but he arrived too late to head off the youngster \u2019 s death . <PARA> casey \u2019 s death was reported by the media at the time of the incident . but , unlike many news stories about the death of a child , the deceased sixth - grader \u2019 s <MASK> was told and retold in ensuing months , primarily via the oprah winfrey show , which talked about the case ( including airing interviews with the distraught parents ) in january , march , and june 2000 . the tale of how casey \u2019 s life ended continued to surface in the news as her parents pursued a civil suit against the school district , asserting that a failure to properly supervise the children led to the death of their daughter . ( in 2005 , her parents settled their lawsuit for $ 2 million .) all of this additional attention served to keep the <MASK> in circulation . <PARA> the folkloric shift this real - life tragedy has taken involves the mode of death . while a very real youngster did indeed lose her life through playing \u201c chubby bunny ,\u201d she did so through choking on the intact confections in her mouth , not ( as developing lore would have it ) via the marshmallows \u2019 somehow breaking down to form a windpipe - clogging glue . in the example <MASK> above , the bonbons were said to have \u201c emulsified \u201d \u2014 that is , turned into a liquid mass . another internet - spread description of the death says \u201c the marshmallows were heated in the mouth and throat and effectively turned into a sticky enough substance that it could not be removed by conventional attempts at first aid .\u201d yet another version <MASK> that \u201c the marshmallows , warming - up to body temperature , took on the form of her air passage , and choked her to death .\u201d we know the marshmallows did not eventually turn into a sticky , fatal mass after casey held them in her mouth for a while because , during the lawsuit brought by casey \u2019 s parents , casey \u2019 s best friend testified seeing her pal \u2019 s lips turn purple just a few seconds after she had put the marshmallows into her mouth . <PARA> while marshmallows can be quickly melted into a thick liquid , goopy substance in a pot on the stove ( as anyone who has made rice krispies squares will attest ), the temperature inside the human mouth is not sufficient to reduce them to that <MASK> . absent chewing or licking , a marshmallow can be held in one \u2019 s mouth approximately 15 minutes before it entirely disappears , its bulk gradually dissolving and being swallowed across the span of that quarter hour . at no point in that process does the resultant fluid become thick or gluey \u2014 it is thin , watery , and easily swallowed . <PARA> the danger presented by the game comes not from the marshmallows being rendered into a suffocating goo in the human mouth by the heat of that environment , but from their bulk . in the zeal to best others , a child may stuff more of the confections into his mouth than he can cope with , potentially lodging one in his throat where it will block his windpipe the way a cork would . it is not any special \u201c melting \u201d property inherent to marshmallows that makes the game hazardous , but rather that the marshmallows take up so much space , and their consistency makes them difficult to remove either via the heimlich maneuver or with medical instruments . <PARA> on 13 september 2006 , another \u201c chubby bunny \u201d death occurred when a 32 - year - old janet rudd choked on a marshmallow and collapsed while participating in the game at a fair in london , ontario . emergency crews were unable to remove the blockage from her throat at the scene ; she was taken to a hospital where she was revived , but she died later that evening .",

        "text": "in september 2008 , hurricane ike made landfall in galveston , texas , the site of the deadliest hurricane in american <MASK> 108 years earlier , and caused multiple deaths and an estimated $ 30 billion in property damage throughout texas , louisiana , and florida . hundreds of thousands of people were forced to evacuate their homes before and during the storm . <PARA> according to the national hurricane center , the bolivar peninsula suffered the worst <MASK> and most destructive storm surges in the united <MASK> . that narrow stretch of land between galveston bay and the gulf of mexico was also the site of one of the iconic images to emerge in the aftermath of hurricane ike : the \u201c last house standing .\u201d <PARA> associated press photographer david j . phillip took a series of photographs of the house that were captioned as picturing \u201c a beachfront home stand [ ing ] among the debris in gilchrist , texas on sunday , sept . 14 , 2008 after hurricane ike hit the area .\u201d <PARA> another view of the same house was provided by the federal emergency management agency ( fema ): <PARA> over the intervening years , the remarkable image became the subject of a viral meme which <MASK> that supernatural forces , rather than pure chance , were to thank for the house \u2019 s escaping destruction . for example , in may 2018 , the \u201c scary facts \u201d facebook page shared this meme : <PARA> the beachfront home , which stood surrounded by debris from neighboring properties , belonged to then 53 - year - old cost analyst pam adams and her husband warren , a 63 - year - old retired electrical designer and u . s . marine veteran . <PARA> in 2005 , hurricane rita had destroyed the couple \u2019 s home in gilchrist , so they rebuilt a house on the same site . therefore , the <MASK> made in the meme , that an exorcism in 1988 later saved the adamses \u2019 home , is <MASK> because the house didn \u2019 t exist until 2006 . <PARA> the real reason the house survived the hurricane was more prosaic . in a 2008 interview with the houston chronicle , warren adams suggested elevation played a key role : <PARA> although the structure remained standing , the interior did not survive unscathed , as cnn reported that \u201c everything was waterlogged and covered in mud . [ pam ] adams said they had to throw clothing , furniture and other destroyed possessions out their windows to stop mold from growing .\u201d <PARA> for a time after the storm , the adamses resided in an apartment in baytown , texas , and seriously considered abandoning bolivar peninsula and moving on . but in the end , they stayed put and rebuilt the house again , along with some ( though not all ) of their neighbors . in a blog post , pam adams later explained the couple \u2019 s decision to stay : <PARA> the last house standing was inhabitable again within a year , and in 2010 pam adams even opened a bar and restaurant nearby called fantasea bbq & grill . ( warren adams died in 2016 at the age of 71 .) <PARA> the survival of the adams home amid the <MASK> hurricane ike caused on the bolivar peninsula was truly remarkable , and aerial photographs of it standing alone in the immediate aftermath of the storm have proven iconic . but an exorcism supposedly performed in 1988 , a full eighteen years before the house was built , had nothing to with any of it .",

        "text": "this is a developing <MASK> . <PARA> in the early morning hours of 2 december 2017 , the senate passed a sweeping tax bill that had been edited in private by republican legislators and included hand - written notes in the margins . the secretive and controversial nature of the bill generated a significant amount of questions and confusion , as did the house \u2019 s draft version of the bill \u2014 which still must be reconciled with the senate version before it becomes law . the senate published the almost 500 - page text of the bill , officially titled the tax cuts and jobs act , on 5 december . <PARA> its controversial nature was illustrated by the dueling hashtags # taxreform and # taxscambill , and , as is often the case in scenarios involving a deep partisan divide , the late - night passage of the bill and social media debate about it led to a number of <MASK> , facebook forwards , and other <MASK> of sometimes questionable veracity . here are some of those questions , answered : <PARA> does the tax plan eliminate deductions for losses from wildfires , other natural disasters ? <PARA> the house version of the bill would entirely eliminate personal casualty loss deductions for uninsured losses from natural disasters , while the senate version would allow them , but only in cases of \u201c federally declared disasters .\u201d the change would not take effect until 2018 , however , which means victims of the 2017 california wildfires would still be able to deduct qualified losses . <PARA> would the tax plan count graduate tuition waivers as taxable income ? <PARA> the version of the tax cuts and jobs act introduced in the house did strike down existing law that exempts tuition waivers from taxable income . however , the final version of the bill passed by the senate removes this provision entirely , leaving graduate school tuition waivers untaxed . <PARA> does the tax plan cut cancer treatments for medicare patients ? <PARA> while the bill does not mention medicare specifically , critics said that the consequences of its passing would trigger cuts that would curtail patients \u2019 access to health care and eliminate medical deductions they would normally count on while seeking treatment , hitting cancer patients especially hard . but republican leadership insists that they would safeguard the program if the bill passes . <PARA> would the tax plan make employee discounts taxable income ? <PARA> the tax cuts and jobs act would remove the exemption for some employee fringe benefits , like reimbursements that employees get from their companies when they move for a job . however , employee discounts , where employees get discounts on products or services sold by their employer , remain untaxed income both in the draft versions and the bill the senate passed on 2 december . <PARA> would the tax bill grant \u201c personhood \u201d to fetuses ? <PARA> both <MORE> <PARA> does the tax plan double the standard deduction for individuals and married couples ? <PARA> the bill increases the standard deduction from $ 6 , 350 to $ 12 , 000 for individuals and from $ 12 , 700 to $ 24 , 000 for married couples \u2014 a key component of the legislation , and one often touted by president trump and republican leaders in congress . <PARA> however , while some people stand to benefit , it won \u2019 t be a windfall for everyone because other deductions would be done away with \u2014 the personal exemptions for individual taxpayers and qualifying dependents ($ 4 , 050 per person ), for example . the los angeles times published an analysis of the tax bill \u2019 s give - and - take surrounding the standard deduction . <PARA> is there a provision in the tax bill allowing oil drilling in alaska \u2019 s arctic wildlife preserve ? <PARA> a proposal on page 461 of the 466 - page senate version of the tax cuts and jobs act would , in fact , \u201c establish and administer a competitive oil and gas program \u201d at the northernmost tip of the arctic national wildlife refuge on alaska \u2019 s north slope . environmental groups strongly objected to the provision , which has no evident connection to tax reform . <PARA> would the tax bill increase taxes on 87 million families ? <PARA> the sources citing this figure \u2014 including the atlantic and the center for american progress \u2014 calculated it using a spreadsheet prepared by the tax policy center , a nonpartisan think tank associated with the brookings institution . the tax policy center based the spreadsheet on their analysis of major provisions in the senate bill . <PARA> however , the <MASK> doesn \u2019 t represent the whole <MASK> . <MASK> more exactly , 87 million households with incomes under $ 200 , 000 a year will see their tax burdens increase by 2027 . adding in taxpayers at the highest income levels , that number swells to just short of 94 million ( 50 . 3 percent of taxpayers ) who will experience a tax increase by 2027 . however , that \u2019 s principally because the bill stipulates that the tax cuts on individuals will expire after 2025 . <PARA> will the tax plan add $ 1 trillion to the federal deficit ? <PARA> according to projections by congress \u2019 s own joint committee on taxation , the tax cut and jobs act ( specifically , the senate version ) would indeed add more than $ 1 trillion in deficits over the next 10 years \u2014 even after economic growth is taken into account . this would mean , among other things , that substantial spending cuts would be required to keep the deficit under control . the estimate may change after the house and senate bills have been reconciled into a single piece of legislation .",

( for example , such stickers might aid newspaper carriers in quickly finding subscribers \u2019 homes and identifying whether the residents receive daily , weekly , or sunday - only delivery .) such colored stickers have also been employed in the service of other ( non - illegal ) schemes , such as using them to distinguish mailboxes at homes that are vacant , have vacation holds , or house <PARA> postal customers who have indicated a desire not to receive junk mail .",

<PARA> i received this column which was written by maureen scott almost two years ago , in an email from my uncle today . it helps to explain why our president is not proud of america \u2013 he was not raised as an american . <PARA> update : i see that the same uncle sent me a link to this <MASK> in 2013 and i posted it then also : see blogpost aug . 17 , 2013 . i guess it struck a chord in me . : o ) <PARA> <MASK> : on 1 march 2013 , columnist maureen scott published an editorial titled \u201c the architect of destruction \u201d on the website renewamerica . scott \u2019 s column was prefaced with a <MASK> from dr . benjamin carson , which described president obama \u2019 s background in community organizing as innately adversarial . <PARA> since being published on the internet in march 2013 , scott \u2019 s writing has widely circulated in full both in e - mail and on facebook . the points made in the popular column are generally subjective and difficult to fact check \u2014 much of it concerned garden variety childhood experiences scott imagined obama was denied , other points speculated upon what the president thought or felt during various american experiences . <PARA> the circulated text , reproduced below , is correctly attributed : <PARA> \u201c obama comes from a community organizer background where it \u2019 s us against them . but that \u2019 s not who we are . and that \u2019 s not the position the leader of our nation should take .\u201d \u2014 dr . benjamin carson <PARA> barack obama appears to be a tormented man filled with resentment , anger , and disdain for anyone of an opinion or view other than his . he acts in the most hateful , spiteful , malevolent <MORE> his opinions were formed by those who either envied us or wanted him to devalue the united <MASK> and the traditions and patriotism that unites us . <PARA> he has never given a speech that is filled with calm , reassuring , complimentary , heartfelt <MASK> about all the people in the u . s . or one that inspires us to be better and grateful and proud that in a short time our country became a leader , and a protector of many . quite the contrary , his speeches always degenerate into mocking , ridiculing tirades as he faults our achievements as well as any critics or opposition for the sake of a laugh , or to bolster his ego . he uses his office to threaten and create fear while demeaning and degrading any american who opposes his policies and actions . a secure leader , who has noble self - esteem and not <MASK> confidence , refrains from showing such dread of critics and displaying a cocky , haughty attitude . <PARA> mostly , his time seems to be spent causing dissension , unrest , and anxiety among the people of america , rather than uniting us ( even though he was presented to us as the \u201c great uniter \u201d). he creates chaos for the sake of keeping people separated , envious , aggrieved and ready to argue . under his leadership americans have been kept on edge , rather than in a <MASK> of comfort and security . he incites people to be aggressive toward , and disrespectful of , those of differing opinions . and through such behavior , obama has lowered the standards for self - control and mature restraint to the level of street - fighting gangs , when he should be raising the bar for people to strive toward becoming more considerate , tolerant , self - disciplined , self - sustaining , and self - assured . not a day goes by that he is not attempting to defy our laws , remove our rights , over - ride established procedures , install controversial appointees , enact divisive mandates , and assert a dictatorial form of power . <PARA> never has there been a leader of this great land who used such tactics to harm and hurt the people and this country . <PARA> never have we had a president who spoke with a caustic , evil tongue against the citizenry rather than present himself as a soothing , calming and trustworthy force . <PARA> never , in this country , have we experienced how much stress one man can cause a nation of people \u2014 on a daily basis ! <PARA> obama has promoted the degeneration of peace , civility , and quality of cooperation between us . he thrives on tearing us down , rather than building us up . he is the architect of the decline of america , and the epitome of a demagogue .",

        "text": "in october 2017 , a video posted to the youtube page of deerpark christian brothers school ( a secondary school in cork , ireland ) purported to show closed - circuit television footage from a school security camera that caught a \u201c ghost \u201d opening and closing doors and knocking over signs : <PARA> the video was a viral hit . it earned coverage by a wide variety of outlets , including today and the new york post , and racked up more than 12 million views within a few weeks of its initial posting . aaron wolfe , the school \u2019 s deputy principal , told news outlets that he didn \u2019 t know how the video was made : <PARA> despite wolfe \u2019 s spooky innuendo , we found a few clues indicating that this video featured some clever editing rather than a ghost . <PARA> a few days after this video was <MASK> posted , the school shared a photograph of the \u201c haunted hallway \u201d to their facebook page along with a brief passage describing their hope that the area would be \u201c paranormal free \u201d that weekend . this image gives a wider view of the hallway \u2014 and also shows the security camera that presumably filmed this paranormal encounter . however , the placement of the school \u2019 s actual security camera does not match up with the position of the camera used in the video : <PARA> the ghost footage was taken at nearly eye level , whereas the visible security camera is located several feet higher and above the door . also , the ghost footage shows the picture frames along the same wall that the actual security camera is located . if this footage was truly taken with this security camera , these frames would have been obscured or hidden . <PARA> so the camera that shot the footage was either floating in mid - air ( possibly held by a second ghost ?) or \u2014 more likely \u2014 was set up on a tripod in the middle of the hallway , indicating that this is the work of humans , not ghosts . <PARA> as these two cameras were in different positions , it wasn \u2019 t possible to perfectly match up the resulting images . however , this comparison shows that the \u201c ghost \u201d footage was not taken from this security camera , despite the <MASK> : <PARA> this ghostly footage also conveniently appeared just a few weeks before the school \u2019 s annual \u201c fearpark \u201d event for halloween . in fact , it was prominently featured in social media posts promoting the event : <PARA> there were a few other clues that the phenomena in the footage were not the work of ghosts . for instance , when the caution sign is upended , the pattern on the floor briefly disappears , indicating that this footage featured clever editing , not paranormal activity : <PARA> even more telling , however , is how the locker door vanishes for a split second before the \u201c ghost \u201d flings papers on the floor . we \u2019 ve slowed down that moment to make it more apparent : <PARA> all the students would have needed to make this video is a tripod , a camera , and some film editing software like after effects \u2014 not the green that wolfe alluded to in his interview with the today show . <PARA> here \u2019 s a tutorial showing how a similar video was made using masking techniques in after effects : <PARA> the cork school does appear to have a penchant for the paranormal . students created elaborate props for the \u201c fearpark \u201d event : <PARA> in april 2016 , a group of first year film students created a zombie film . <PARA> when we have reached out to the school to clarify the contents of the video , wolfe told us that it was \u201c 100 percent not a student project \u201d, and that if it was a prank \u201c no one has come forward .\u201d wolfe also said that a second disturbance had been caught on camera : <PARA> it seems that the creator of the first video learned from some of the apparent mistakes in the <MASK> . the camera is in a slightly higher position that more closely matches the angle of a security camera , and the editing is less obvious . however , some artifacts of editing can still be glimpsed ; they are most noticeable as the chair crosses the floor ( note the disappearing line between the legs and the blurry outline surrounding the chair ): <PARA> the school may not be know ( or at least won \u2019 t admit ) how this video was created , but they don \u2019 t appear to be afraid of the alleged ghoul stalking their hallways . the school \u2019 s halloween celebration is going on as scheduled and several faculty members dressed up for the occasion , including one person who will roam the hallways as a ghost :",

( lithia is better known as lithium , a drug used to even out mood swings .) grigg had the notion that the chemical \u2019 s presumed healthful aspects would be a selling point with the soda - buying public , hence the \u201c lithiated \u201d in the name . as for \u201c bib - label ,\u201d it was howdy corporation \u2019 s intent to use paper labels of the sort that could be dropped over the necks of otherwise unlabeled bottles . <PARA> fortunately , the unwieldy name was soon morphed to \u201c 7up lithiated lemon soda ,\u201d and in 1936 the soda was officially re - dubbed \u201c 7up .\u201d that same year , the howdy corporation became the seven - up company . <PARA> as to why \u201c 7up ,\u201d c . l . grigg never explained how he came up with the cryptic name . several theories exist about its <MASK> : <PARA> ( which it was . then again , so was orange crush .) <PARA> it \u2019 s quite possible the drink \u2019 s name was meant to be a enigma , given that its creator never publicly explained it . it could even have been a nonsense term meant to leave people wondering after its <MASK> as a way of generating interest in the beverage . ( we humans do love mysteries , after all .) <PARA> questions of how it came by its name aside , 7up has attracted another <MASK> <MASK> . many trivia lists circulated on the internet make the following <MASK> : <PARA> the \u2018 spot \u2019 on 7up comes from its inventor who had red eyes . he was albino . <PARA> charles leiper grigg wasn \u2019 t an <PARA> albino . in photographs ( albeit black and white ones ), <PARA> he appears normally pigmented , and we \u2019 ve yet to encounter a biography of him that makes any mention of his displaying traits of albinism . ( by the way , though it is <PARA> possible for an albino to have reddish or violet eyes , most people with that condition have blue eyes , and some have hazel or brown eyes .) <PARA> as to where the red dot in the beverage \u2019 s logo came from , so far the earliest examples we \u2019 ve found of that design have come from the 1970s . prior to that , the company \u2019 s trademark for the longest time was a black - outlined white \u201c 7up \u201d on a red background that bore some white bubbles \u2014 the red dot was nowhere to be seen . in very early ads , the \u201c 7up \u201d had wings . <PARA> barbara \u201c 7upswept \u201d mikkelson",

        "text": "in september 2018 , a viral video spread on facebook with a description reading \u201c woman records sunflowers in her garden .\u201d the video shows a woman who has placed two electrode stickers on the leaf of a sunflower plant , which in turn connect to her phone , and is overlaid with an ambient sounding but pleasant noise purported to be created by the plant : <PARA> despite the fact that the sounds were generated by computer software and that the electrodes did not record noise but rather electrical conductivity , dubious websites have taken the suggestion of plant sounds a step further and suggested that the audio signal represents some form of plant communication . a representative example of this line of thinking comes from the content mill \u201c good times \u201d: <PARA> for this line of thinking to be in any way scientifically valid , three things would need to be <MASK> . first , the device used to generate the recording must actually be recording \u201c noise \u201d created by the plant . second , the \u201c noise \u201d presented in the viral video needs to be tied to an actual \u201c communication \u201d mechanism found in the sunflower . third , sunflowers ( or plants in general ) need to be capable of both generating and receiving auditory cues . the first <MASK> is categorically <MASK> . the latter two <MASK> delve into extremely theoretical and unverified areas of science . <PARA> the woman in the video appears to be using a product known as the midi sprout . developed by musicians and artists interested in the intersection of technology and nature , the device uses software to take a messy electrical signal generated by the plant and translate it into audible , tuned noise played by computerized instruments : <PARA> the creators of the device make no scientific <MASK> about what this process represents from a plant science standpoint , although they assert that they have noticed the sound changes correlate with a variety of physical or even emotional changes . \u201c as artists more than scientists , we feel we can best serve in fostering understanding of plant consciousness through sharing this experience with people . we \u2019 ll leave the explaining to the scientists , or maybe you , if you \u2019 re so inspired !\u201d their website <MASK> . <PARA> in effect , their device records minute changes in electrical conductivity ( since all organisms generate some level of electrical current ) and transposes that signal into a command for a digital synthesizer . \u201c sound ,\u201d however , is defined as \u201c acoustic energy in the form of an oscillatory concussive pressure wave transmitted through gases , liquids , and solids .\u201d the \u201c sounds \u201d of this sunflower were produced by ios software programmed specifically to make a nice harmony and were transmitted through the air by a speaker , not produced by the plant itself . <PARA> putting <MORE> a human body would also produce melodious noise with a midi sprout , as human bodies ( like sunflowers ) exhibit minute changes in electrical conductivity . to say that such a process records the communicative noises of a human would be just as absurd as saying the same of the \u201c sunflower sounds .\u201d <PARA> plants do communicate with each other , in ways science understands and also , at least likely , in ways it does not . for example , many plants release volatile organic chemicals when damage to their leaves occurs . that release can serve as a signal to other nearby plants to increase defensive mechanisms . plants can also release signals meant to repel or attract various insects or other organisms , which could be considered a form of communication as well . <PARA> other research has suggested that similar to the synapses in an animal \u2019 s brain , electric ( or action ) potentials between cells could serve to transmit or even store information within an organism or between two different organisms \u2014 something that could perhaps be picked up by a device measuring changes in electric conductivity . this science is in its infancy , however , and the connection to the sounds that would be produced by the midi sprout are entirely theoretical . <PARA> although the noise in the video was not the amplification of the actual vibrational waves of a plant , some scientists have speculated about the possible role ( actual ) sound could play in the life of plants . some research ( and countless schoolroom experimentation ) suggests that plants may respond in various ways to noise . some research also demonstrates that plants do generate small amounts of ultrasonic sound themselves . <PARA> the \u201c good times \u201d <MASK> suggests that \u201c a study done by the university of western australia in which researchers discovered clicking sounds coming from the roots of corn saplings ,\u201d provides support for the notion that plants may communicate between each other with auditory signals . this suggestion is a bit of a stretch . <PARA> the paper they refer to is an intentionally speculative paper meant to generate discussion and did not involve any new research . instead , the authors cited an unpublished doctoral dissertation which they said \u201c illustrates that the young roots of corn generate structured , spike - like , acoustic emissions .\u201d what is the possible significance of those spikes ? \u201c to date , the production mechanisms and adaptive value of such acoustic emissions remain elusive ,\u201d the authors reported . <PARA> whether or not one wants to interpret the computer - generated translation of a plant \u2019 s electrical conductivity shifts into intentionally harmonic music as the communication of a plant is more of a philosophical question . from a factual standpoint , however , the noises \u201c recorded \u201d in the video were not sounds produced by that plant .",

        "text": "<MASK> : this <MASK> has been part of the campus lore canon since at least the mid - 1970s . it appears to be more common in great britain than it does in north america , but canadian and american tellings of it have been recorded . <PARA> scurvy is a disease that strikes down those who are deficient in vitamin c ( ascorbic acid ). this illness is <PARA> relatively well contained in modern times , but in centuries past it took many lives , with its worst ravages noted among sailors whose long sea voyages kept them from having access to fruits and vegetables . ( vasco da gama , for example , lost more than half his crew to this malady on his first trip around the cape of good hope in 1497 .) in 1747 lemons and oranges were fed to scurvy - riddled sailors with dramatic results , and in 1795 the british navy began doling out regular rations of lime juice during long sea forays ( hence the slang term \u2018 limeys \u2019 for british sailors ), a practice that was highly successful in preventing the disease . <PARA> scurvy is characterized by general lethargy , anemia , pain in the joints and muscles , impaired wound healing , gum disease , and skin hemorrhages . those who have it are impaired by weakness , aches and pains everywhere , and the loosening of teeth in their gums . the disease is quickly cured by dosing with vitamin c and easily prevented the same way . <PARA> the legendary student who comes down with scurvy is said to have attended various institutes of higher learning , and is sometimes described as a grad student . but the greatest variation to be found in the tale is in the diet that supposedly was the young man \u2019 s undoing \u2014 different versions have the hapless grind dining solely upon : <PARA> the legend makes different points depending on how it \u2019 s told . the porridge , ramen , and pasta versions present a woeful tale of a student who is forced by his poverty to restrict himself to one or two inexpensive foodstuffs which , though cheap , are nutritionally lacking . he contracts scurvy out of his inability to buy good food , his pursuit of knowledge thus bringing him to harm . such versions underscore the privations of the scholastic life and are displayed by other ( presumably better fed ) collegians as examples of the hardships of student <PARA> life . <PARA> in contrast , the hot dogs , potato chips , and pork pies versions deliver a just deserts message of an immature student acting in a hedonistically short - sighted manner , then having to pay the price for his folly . such stories attempt to teach through example the necessity of the student \u2019 s taking responsibility for his health when out from under parental constraint . of <MORE> other vitamins and minerals . the student confessed to doctors that he ate no fruit and vegetables , consuming only a few types of foods \u2014 namely , cheese , crackers , soda , cookies , chocolate and water .\u201d <PARA> scurvy is an illness that , though it belongs to another time , is still very much with us today even in affluent countries . it is more usually found among the elderly ( who may be forgetting to eat right or whose fixed incomes restrict them to a limited diet ) and alcoholics ( who both forget to take care of mundane bodily needs like eating in their pursuit of demon rum and whose every cent goes towards liquor purchases ). but it is also on the rise among the poor of well - off societies . the impoverished often stick to bad , unvaried diets deficient in vitamins , choosing convenience and ease of preparation over good food value . ( it is possible to eat well on very little money , but doing so involves cooking dishes from scratch rather than from a mix or out of a box , a practice that is far more labor intensive and skill dependent .) <PARA> this poverty apparently extends to those attending university , according to the national union of students in scotland , who in 1996 said student medical services had detected instances of malnutrition among undergraduates . in similar vein , a 1998 report from a university in the united <MASK> found that a significant number of students <MASK> dangerously low levels of vitamin c . <PARA> does this mean legions of college students are dragging their scurvy - riddled bodies to class each day ? oh , probably not . though malnutrition and even vitamin c deficiency might be occurring often enough to be noted on campus , it takes a person twenty to forty days without vitamin c to develop scurvy . remember , even very small amounts of ascorbic acid prevent this disease , and as well as the obvious citrus fruit sources ( oranges , lemons , limes , grapefruits ), this key vitamin is found in a number of other fruits and vegetables such as strawberries , cantaloupes , papayas , raspberries , kiwi fruits , tomatoes , watermelons , green peppers , cabbage , cauliflower , spinach , broccoli , brussels sprouts , and potatoes . a serving of any one of these will generally provide the recommended minimum dietary allowance ( rda ) of 60 mg a day of vitamin c for an adult , but as little as a daily dose of 5 - 7 mg will prevent scurvy . therefore , even a mere tomato slice a day should be enough to fend off this ailment or , for those really pinching the pennies , a quarter of a cup of cooked potatoes . <PARA> barbara \u201c an apple a day keeps the paramedics away \u201d mikkelson",

motivated conspiracy to subvert democracy in the united <MASK> \u2014 they played soccer and went to college together . <PARA> israel abel \u201c izzy \u201d hernandez is a 2009 inductee into the north carolina soccer hall of fame , primarily for his accomplishments as a coach , but also as a player . his hall of fame profile describes his career as follows : <PARA> as a young man , he played soccer <MORE> photograph that went viral as part of the \u201c <MASK> flag \u201d conspiracy theory , strongly indicating that the two men were photographed together at no more than a celebration in honor of their former college soccer coach bob scarborough . <PARA> this also disproves the <MASK> that the photograph showed the two men together \u201c just last year .\u201d in fact , the photograph was taken in 2015 , not 2017 . <PARA> in the aftermath of sayoc \u2019 s arrest , scarborough told the raleigh , north carolina tv <MASK> wral that his former player had kept in touch with him over the years , providing intermittent updates on his life and career developments , but that he hadn \u2019 t heard from him since the october 2015 hall of fame induction celebration : <PARA> \u2018 a known democrat \u2019 <PARA> there is also no <MASK> to support the second component of this particular strand of the \u201c <MASK> flag \u201d conspiracy theory \u2014 that hernandez is a democratic donor or supporter \u2014 and there is some <MASK> to contradict it . <PARA> as we have shown , sayoc and hernandez knew each other from playing soccer together at college in the early 1980s , so even if either or both men were at some point supporters of or contributors to either the democratic or republican party , their having been photographed together could easily be explained by something other than a political conspiracy . <PARA> even so , hernandez does not appear to be a democrat , at least not in any formal sense . according to records held by the north carolina <MASK> board of elections and ethics enforcement , israel abel hernandez is registered in wake county as an \u201c unaffiliated voter \u201d ( that is , as an independent .) <PARA> his voting <MASK> shows that , aside from general elections , his only participation in a partisan primary came on 15 march 2016 , when he cast a ballot in north carolina \u2019 s republican presidential primary . in north carolina , unaffiliated voters can only vote in one party \u2019 s primary election , not both . <PARA> despite searching campaign finance records held by both the federal election commission and the north carolina <MASK> board of elections and ethics enforcement , we could find no record whatsoever of hernandez having made any donations to a political candidate or committee of any kind . <PARA> we are emphatically not suggesting that izzy hernandez \u2019 s voting <MASK> or political affiliation ( or lack thereof ) is of any particular meaning or relevance . <PARA> however , the lack of any <MASK> that he is a democratic supporter or donor even further undermines the october 2018 meme which took a photograph of two old soccer teammates reunited three decades after their college days , and attempted , without any factual basis , to twist it into a dark and violent political conspiracy .",

        "text": "every mass shooting event in the united <MASK> prompts renewed debate about the efficacy of gun control regulations , and the 1 october 2015 shooting at umpqua community college in oregon that left nine people dead on was no exception . such debates typically feature each side presenting charts contrasting violent crime and homicide rates in countries with permissive and restrictive gun ownership laws to make the case that the prevalence of guns corresponds to either higher or lower crime rates . <PARA> the wake of the umpqua community college shooting brought the widespread online circulation of an image which sought to make the point that two countries of roughly equal population , honduras and switzerland , had radically different laws regarding gun ownership and radically different homicide rates : switzerland , where gun ownership is supposedly mandatory , has the world \u2019 s lowest homicide rate , while honduras , where gun ownership is supposedly prohibited , has the world \u2019 s highest homicide rate : <PARA> first off , even before we check the specific <MASK> about each country , we have to note that this item presents a flawed premise . for a comparison of this nature to be valid , the two things being compared should be fairly equivalent outside of the factors being examined , but that isn \u2019 t the case here . the two countries mentioned here are so very different that this isn \u2019 t just a comparison of apples and oranges ; it \u2019 s more like a comparison of apples and radishes . <PARA> honduras and switzerland are roughly equivalent in population ( a little of upwards of 8 million people each ), but other than that , they aren \u2019 t the least bit similar in geography , economics , or culture . switzerland is a small , landlocked country in western europe surrounded by three of the most affluent countries in the world ( germany , france , and italy ) in terms of gross domestic product ( gdp ), and even though switzerland itself is fairly small in population ( 96th in the world ) and size ( 134th in the world ), it ranks in the top 20 in terms of gdp . on the other hand , honduras is a central american country that is nearly three times the size of switzerland and possesses coasts along both the pacific ocean and the caribbean sea , but is a \u201c lower middle - income country with persistent poverty and inequality challenges ,\u201d with a gdp only about 2 . 5 % that of switzerland and three neighbors ( nicaragua , el salvador , guatemala ) that share similar economic conditions . not to mention that honduras is right in the path of the flow of drugs shipped by sea and air from colombia and has therefore been ravaged by the drug war and its attendant factors of massive criminal organizations , violence , and governmental instability . <PARA> as far as homicide rates go , honduras does have the highest intentional homicide rate in the world at about 90 . 4 homicides per 100 , 000 people per year ( which is even shockingly higher than the homicide rate of the next worst country , venezuela , at 53 . 7 ). although switzerland \u2019 s intentional homicide rate is indeed low at 0 . 6 , it isn \u2019 t quite the lowest in the world : it \u2019 s bested by several other countries such as liechtenstein , monaco , iceland , hong kong , singapore , japan , the latter two of which have some of the most restrictive gun control laws in the world . moreover , a better metric for comparison purposes here might perhaps be the firearm - related death rate rather than the overall intentional homicide rate ; in that case , honduras is still the worst , but switzerland doesn \u2019 t fare quite as well ( ranking behind about 43 other countries ). <PARA> additionally , it is not <MASK> that honduras \u201c bans citizens from owning guns \u201d nor that switzerland \u201c requires citizens to own guns .\u201d honduras enacted a ban on open and concealed carry in 2007 , but a 2012 news report <MASK> that \u201c under the existing law , citizens are allowed to own as many as five personal firearms ,\u201d and in mid - 2014 guns & ammo rated honduras as one of the \u201c 10 best countries for gun owners ,\u201d saying that \u201c hondurans may purchase most popular types of shotguns , handguns or rifles for the recognized purposes of self - defense and recreation .\u201d while switzerland ranks fourth among all countries in gun ownership per capita ( much higher than honduras ), they do not \u201c require \u201d all their citizens to own guns . switzerland has a long <MASK> of mandatory military service for all able - bodied male citizens . the government issues firearms to conscripted men which , after training , they take home with them and keep until the conclusion of their military obligation ( about age 34 for non - officers ), but no other citizens are \u201c required \u201d to own guns : <PARA> swiss citizens may buy and keep firearms , subject to certain restrictions and licensing requirements : <PARA> all in all , this meme compares two countries that aren \u2019 t the least bit similar , then gets wrong nearly all the aspects of those countries it references . as such , it isn \u2019 t the least bit useful or instructive as a discussion point for debates over gun ownership laws .",

        "text": "while the urge to take something good from the awfulness that was 11 september 2001 serves as motivation to look to uplifting stories from that day , <MASK> accounts of such nature are few and far between . this tale about 40 marines standing guard over a corral of cribs protecting babies and toddlers rescued from a daycare center near the pentagon is a bit of fiction : <PARA> american flight 77 crashed into pentagon at 9 : 43 a . m . on that fateful day . all was confusion in washington for at least the next hour , with order only gradually emerging from the chaos as various folks tried to work out what had happened , what help was needed where , and whether further attacks were on the way . <PARA> there were daycares near the pentagon , including one located in a building 30 yards from that facility , fortunately on the opposite side from where the airplane struck . children from these facilities were evacuated by those running those establishments , with help from other sources arriving only well after the fact . there was no group of 40 burly marines racing into a distressed daycare center to snatch up toddlers and cribs , then forming a defensive ring around the tykes ; instead , in the absence of outside assistance , those in charge of the kids fended as best they could for those in their care . for instance , at the children \u2019 s world learning center at the pentagon , the teachers sang nursery rhymes to their 138 young charges as they led them to safety . <PARA> said time of the situation that morning : <PARA> a scouring of news stories from the days immediately following 9 / 11 through the next few months uncovered no news accounts about a cadre of marines rescuing children from a daycare center near the pentagon , or indeed of members of any other branch of service snatching up kids and cribs then making a protective corral of the cribs and standing guard over it . this is not a <MASK> that would have gone unreported , because even if the marines in question had kept their peace about their actions that day , the kids , the daycare workers , and the parents of the kids certainly wouldn \u2019 t have . <PARA> the tale about 40 marines charging to the rescue ( which began its online life in september 2008 ), possibly resulted from a mishearing , misunderstanding , or just plain exaggeration of the actions taken that day by army colonel dave komar and his staff and rangers from the national park service to assist and protect those who had evacuated children from the pentagon \u2019 s daycare facility . seven park rangers were dispatched to assist the group of evacuees , reaching it at approximately noon . once there , the park rangers set up a protective perimeter around the children and blocked one lane of westbound traffic on the george washington memorial parkway to increase safety . they then persuaded the driver of an empty tour bus to help transport the kids to a virginia department of transportation ( dot ) facility where they could better watch over and care for the tots until parents came to <MASK> their children . <PARA> the park rangers did not magically appear just as the youngsters needed to be moved from the threatened daycare ( they joined up with the evacuated group a couple of hours after it reached the open field ), nor did they cart heavy cribs full of kids out of a building , nor did they form a ring of cribs \u201c like the covered wagons in the west \u201d and then stand guard outside it to keep the children from getting loose . however , they were involved in protecting a group of children moved from a daycare after the attack , with this protection involving ( at least at one point ) the establishment of a protective perimeter around their small charges . it \u2019 s enough of a similarity to have potentially served as the kernel for the much embellished tale involving 40 marines and a ring of baby cribs . <PARA> the most interesting <MASK> having to do with the pentagon \u2019 s daycare facility that day wasn \u2019 t primarily about the children or even the evacuation , but one of the parents . that morning , col . william stoppel of the national guard dropped his 9 - month - old son at daycare , then continued on to his office in the pentagon \u2019 s inner ring , where he was assigned to the department of the army \u2019 s g - 1 office processing promotion packets . news of the attacks in new york prompted this dad to want to check on his son , so at the time the plane hit the pentagon , he was in the daycare facility on the other side of the building ( and thus helped to move kids to the field spoken of earlier ). <PARA> unknown to him as he helped shepherd kids , stoppel \u2019 s office had been one of those that sustained a direct hit . many of his co - workers had perished in the attack , including the man with which he had shared a cubicle . stoppel himself was presumed dead for the better part of the day .",

it \u2019 s a massive conflict of interest .\u201d <PARA> breitbart also cited a politico piece by journalist garrett graff in which graff described the pair \u2019 s working relationship as follows : <PARA> as to kallstrom \u2019 s comment , it should be clarified that comey didn \u2019 t appoint mueller , and the former had been fired from his position at the fbi by president trump by the time by deputy attorney general rod rosenstein brought mueller on board to head the russia investigation . <PARA> we spoke to comey \u2019 s attorney , who said the extent of the friendship between the two men has been exaggerated . we also consulted experts about whether a past friendship could present a perception of a current conflict . as the term \u201c perception \u201d implies , the answer to that question is subjective . <PARA> david kelley , comey \u2019 s attorney , told us that the notion comey is \u201c best friends \u201d with mueller is an <MASK> . he said the two have a genial relationship as former colleagues , given that both men have long legal careers that involved overlapping time spent working within the department of justice . their <MASK> has been well - documented by the news media , and kelley pointed out they are not close personal friends : <PARA> friendship or no , a pre - existing relationship doesn \u2019 t mean that mueller \u2019 s role in the investigation rises to the level of the legal definition of a conflict of interest that would require recusal , said craig holman , government affairs lobbyist for the accountability and transparency lobbying organization public citizen : \u201c conflict of interest means there \u2019 s some financial or pecuniary benefit that could come one \u2019 s way [ as a result of an investigation ]. for example , if i had worked at a business and business has something at stake , that \u2019 s a conflict . but just people being friends and knowing each other , that \u2019 s not a conflict . <PARA> hana callaghan , director of the government ethics program for santa clara university \u2019 s markkula center for applied ethics , told us she doesn \u2019 t believe the pair \u2019 s past ties rise to the level of a recusable event , but she added that it \u2019 s not a clear - cut issue when it comes to public perception : <PARA> national security attorney mark zaid also told us via e - mail that \u201c at worst , there could be a perceived appearance of a conflict to some but not an actual one . additionally , special counsel mueller has a whole team of prosecutors involved who will participate in any decisions and reports .\u201d <PARA> kelley placed additional doubt on the <MASK> by maintaining that comey didn \u2019 t have anything at stake in the investigation \u2019 s outcome : <PARA> perceptions about mueller and comey \u2019 s shared <MASK> seem to be largely drawn along partisan lines , and the winding sequence of events shows how politically fraught the investigation has been . <PARA> mueller was brought on board when rosenstein came under pressure from members of congress after he penned a letter to president trump suggesting comey be ousted , a suggestion the president then acted on . rosenstein \u2019 s participation in comey \u2019 s firing raised questions both about his impartiality and about obstruction of justice on the part of the president , since at the time the fbi was investigating alleged trump campaign collusion with the kremlin . <PARA> after he was fired , comey revealed he had written extensive contemporaneous memos documenting meetings he had with the president that made him uncomfortable . comey recounted that trump demanded loyalty and pressured him to back off investigating former national security adviser michael flynn . <PARA> despite the tumult , mueller enjoys bipartisan respect as a nonpartisan , seasoned , and professional prosecutor . his selection to lead the russia probe was initially praised by both republicans and democrats . but as the investigation has intensified , so too has criticism from the president and his allies . for example , in less than two days ( between 15 june and mid - afternoon on 16 june 2017 ), president trump posted seven separate , disparaging tweets decrying the investigation as a \u201c witch hunt \u201d: <PARA> in an example of how dialogue surrounding the probe has evolved , trump surrogate newt gingrich tweeted praise for mueller on the day he was appointed , saying : \u201c robert mueller is superb choice to be special counsel . his reputation is impeccable for honesty and integrity . media should now calm down .\u201d <PARA> just one month later , gingrich had completely changed course with a mistrustful and paranoid <MASK> , writing that \u201c mueller is setting up a dragnet of obstruction , financial questions and every aspect of trump \u2019 s life and his associates lives . very dangerous .\u201d",

( theoretically , a taxpayer with nonqualified dividend earnings who reached the top marginal federal income tax rate would be paying 39 . 6 % tax on those earnings , but that \u2019 s a condition that only applies to persons earning over several hundred thousand dollars per year .) <PARA> the list \u2019 s reference to an \u201c income payroll tax \u201d increase from 37 . 4 % to 52 . 2 % is something of a mystery , as this is not a standard term for any type of government income - or payroll - related tax . the only adjustment to payroll - related taxes resulting from the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 was that a two - year old cut to payroll taxes which had previously reduced the rate from 6 . 2 % to 4 . 2 % for 2011 and 2012 was not extended . <PARA> additionally , this item \u2019 s coda <MASK> that \u201c not one republican voted to do these taxes \u201d is completely <MASK> . the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 passed congress by a margin of 89 - 8 in the senate with 40 republican votes in favor , and a margin of 257 - 167 in the house with 85 republican votes in favor . ( the <MASK> <MASK> undoubtedly refers to the house or representatives \u2019 voting in 2010 to pass the health - care reform bill without a single republican vote in favor , but that association is moot because , as noted , the tax increases listed above had nothing to do with that bill .)",

        "text": "<MASK> : in september 2002 , those who frequented areas of the internet devoted to the pleasures of marijuana found themselves confronted with a persistent <MASK> involving billboards supposedly placed alongside roads by the u . s . drug enforcement administration ( dea ). although the <PARA> location ( s ) of the signs changed from telling to telling , the gist of the <MASK> remained the same : the message <MASK> by those charged with drug enforcement trumpeted , \u201c if you think it \u2019 s dry now , wait until october \u201d ( or sometimes \u201c... wait until october 15 \u2032\u2032). <PARA> folks would <MASK> someone they knew had seen the sign , or even that they themselves had seen it . though the call for photographs of the infamous billboard went out , it invariably went unanswered . the sign was said to have been sighted in minnesota . or ohio . or virginia . or near tampa . or near houston . or in detroit . everywhere , in fact , where folks who smoke marijuana were nervous about it . in other words , all across the usa . <PARA> there wasn \u2019 t anything to it . the dea hasn \u2019 t been posting such signs , nor is it ever likely to , given that there \u2019 s no upside to warning users that hard times are just around the corner ( to do so would be akin to advising potheads , \u201c visit your local dealer and stock up now !\u201d). nor was this <MASK> a new one : those encountering it for the first time in the fall of 2002 had little notion that the tale had been around for more than a decade , as shown in this example from a 1991 internet newsgroup discussion : <PARA> that reminds me ... a friend of mine was in la 2 months ago . he said he saw stencilled spraypaint signs on some inner - city streets that read : <PARA> \u2018 if you think it \u2019 s bad now , <PARA> wait until september - dea \u2019 <PARA> the \u201c dea billboard \u201d <MASK> has surfaced numerous times in the years since then , sometimes altered a little bit : <PARA> this past week the melbourne / cocoa beach dea stumbled onto a large quantity of marihuana and the stumble - bums made a bust . they broke their arms patting themselves on the back , they posted signs all over town ; a marihuana leaf with the red circle and the line through it , and underneath it said , \u201c if you think it \u2019 s dry now , just wait till the dea finishes their job .\u201d ( 1998 ) <PARA> <PARA> when i was living in brevard county fl during \u2019 98 , around sept there were billboards on i - 95 that said : \u201c if you think it \u2019 s dry now , wait until october .\u201d - sherrif \u2019 s dept , brevard county fl ( 2001 ) <PARA> when i was living in brevard county fl during \u2019 98 , around sept there were billboards on i - 95 that said : \u201c if you think it \u2019 s dry now , wait until october .\u201d - sherrif \u2019 s dept , brevard county fl ( 2001 ) <PARA> why this tale appears at various times is anyone \u2019 s guess , but it \u2019 s possible the 2002 outbreak was at least in part attributable to the dry , <PARA> hot summer that burned off all manner of crops across north america that year , not just wacky tobaccy . locally - grown marijuana would have been harder to come by during those stultifying summer months , which would make <MASK> about law enforcement - induced shortages all that much more believable \u2014 disruptions of illegal activities are always first thought to be the work of police , and only after that premise has been examined and discarded that other factors ( weather , cost , reduction in number of suppliers ) are taken into account . also , terrible local growing conditions for marijuana increase dependence upon a foreign supply which is far more vulnerable to confiscation and therefore also a greater source of anxiety to those looking to partake of the weed . perhaps the \u201c dea billboards \u201d whisper is a way of putting apprehensions about what is perceived as a shortening supply into words . <PARA> barbara \u201c acapulco goal \u2019 d \u201d mikkelson",

<PARA> thought all my contacts ought to see this if you \u2019 ve not already seen this demo .... wow ! <PARA> <MASK> : in december 2010 , memphis television <MASK> wreg aired an \u201c electronic pickpocketing \u201d piece on the potential risks posed by \u201c contactless \u201d credit / debit / atm cards containing embedded rfid ( radio frequency identification technology ) chips . such chips encode basic information ( e . g ., account numbers , expiration dates ) that can be picked up by point - of - sale rfid readers , eliminating the need for cards to be physically handled or swiped . one possible drawback to this technology is unauthorized persons might use rfid readers of their own to surreptitiously glean that same information , as demonstrated in wreg \u2019 s report , which featured walt augustinowicz of identity stronghold using a card reader and a netbook computer to engage in card \u201c skimming \u201d \u2014 picking up account information off rfid - enabled cards carried in the pockets and purses of random passers - by on the street . a few days after it broadcast the <MASK> \u201c electronic pickpocketing \u201d <MASK> , wreg reported the piece had gone <PARA> viral , racking up 1 . 2 million views in just three days . <PARA> despite all the publicity wreg \u2019 s report garnered , the concept of rfid - enabled credit card theft was hardly a new one . various news , technical , and security <PARA> outlets have been reporting ( and demonstrating ) for several years the potential risk that information transmitted wirelessly by rfid - enabled cards might be picked up by eavesdropping thieves using relatively cheap equipment . but although ( as demonstrated in wreg \u2019 s piece ) it \u2019 s certainly possible for interlopers to read pieces of information from some contactless cards under some circumstances , the extent to which <MORE> as some reports have made it sound : <PARA> none of the cards transmits the additional number on the front or back , known as the card validation code , that some businesses require for online purchases . <PARA> [ c ] ompany representatives argued [ that ] the process of making purchases with the cards involves verification procedures based on powerful encryption that make each transaction unique . most cards , they said , actually transmit a dummy number that does not match the number embossed on the card , and that number can be used only in connection with the verification \u201c token ,\u201d or a small bit of code , that is encrypted before being sent . <PARA> \u201c it \u2019 s basically useless information ,\u201d said david bonalle , vice president and general manager for advanced payments at american express . \u201c you can \u2019 t steal that data and just play it back and expect that transaction to work .\u201d <PARA> [ c ] ompany representatives argued [ that ] the process of making purchases with the cards involves verification procedures based on powerful encryption that make each transaction unique . most cards , they said , actually transmit a dummy number that does not match the number embossed on the card , and that number can be used only in connection with the verification \u201c token ,\u201d or a small bit of code , that is encrypted before being sent . <PARA> \u201c it \u2019 s basically useless information ,\u201d said david bonalle , vice president and general manager for advanced payments at american express . \u201c you can \u2019 t steal that data and just play it back and expect that transaction to work .\u201d <PARA> however , some merchants are not assiduous about requiring extra levels of security information from their customers beyond credit card number and expiration date , and security providers contend that card skimmers can still find plenty of places to make purchases with nothing more than 16 - digit account numbers and expiration dates . <PARA> it remains the case that cardholders are not liable for the fraudulent use of their credit card information , but consumers who are extra cautious have the option of investing in secure sleeves that shield the rfid signals transmitted by their cards from electronic eavesdroppers . <PARA> on 17 february 2016 , an updated version of the <MASK> began making the rounds , this time accompanied by a photo of a man holding a point of sale ( pos ) device : <PARA> however , the photo that went along with this <MASK> wasn \u2019 t taken by paul jarvis . it appeared in an 8 february 2016 <MASK> about possible electronic pickpocketing in russia . in any case , \u201c electronic pickpocketing ,\u201d with or without point of sale devices , remained rare as of 2016 , but rfid sleeves for cards remained readily available for those with lingering concerns .",
