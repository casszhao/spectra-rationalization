1,"in the days before cable tv ( and the myriad other entertainments that have since sprung up to sap our attention ), the networks reigned supreme in the television industry . landing a series in the prime time line - up of one of the “ big three ” ( cbs , nbc , and abc ), where competition was fierce for the few slots that opened up each year , was a tv producer ’ s ultimate achievement . keeping his series on the air after having secured a network spot for it was a tv producer ’ s next greatest achievement . <PARA> it was with justifiable pride , then , that gene roddenberry found himself considering ways to enhance the popularity of his new star trek series in september 1966 . after years of planning and effort ( including the unusual circumstance of his having to produce two separate pilots with two different casts ), roddenberry had managed to convince nbc to take a chance on something outside the usual tried - and - <MASK> westerns and family sitcoms that dominated network schedules : a non - anthology science fiction series set on a space ship three hundred years in the future . <PARA> the chances of landing such a show with a network had been slim ; the chances of keeping it there were even slimmer . so it ’ s no wonder that after only two episodes of star trek had been aired , its creator / producer was already thinking ahead its next season . with an eye towards higher ratings , roddenberry wrote a memo to casting director joe d ’ agosta on 22 september 1966 which said : <PARA> if the wording and date of this memo are accurate , roddenberry was prescient indeed . by 22 september 1966 , the monkees ( which , like star trek , was never much a ratings winner during its <MASK> run ) had aired but two episodes , both of which had lost their time slot in the viewership contest to gilligan ’ s island . and “ last train to clarksville ,” the monkees ’ first record , had yet to crack the top 40 on billboard ’ s singles chart . roddenberry must have been following the television industry ( and the teen market ) quite keenly to have caught on to davy jones ’ nascent popularity so quickly . <PARA> the new character roddenberry suggested did show up during star trek ‘ s second season in 1967 - 68 in the person of an ensign serving as the ship ’ s navigator and junior science officer , as portrayed by actor walter koenig . the character ’ s beatlesque / monkeesque <MASK> were demonstrated by the “ mop - top ” wig placed atop koenig ’ s head for his first few episodes until his own hair grew out to a suitable length . ( as william shatner recalled , “ <MORE> second - hand long after the fact . <PARA> however , apparently there is at least something to the pravda <MASK> , as the 1996 book inside star trek : the real <MASK> ( by desilu executive herb solow and star trek associate producer robert justman ) reproduces a 1967 letter from gene roddenberry on star trek letterhead to the editor of pravda , informing the latter of chekov ’ s addition to the cast . unless the letter was a latter - day forgery created to lend support to a publicity stunt , it would indicate that roddenberry at least believed pravda had run such an editorial , whether they genuinely did or not . <PARA> all of this conflicting information makes it difficult to assign a “ <MASK> ” or “ <MASK> ” <MASK> to the <MASK> <MASK> at the top of this page . in a strict sense , one could say it isn ’ t <MASK> that the chekov character was added to the star trek cast because of a editorial in pravda ( whether or not such an editorial was ever actually published ), since gene roddenberry had already been thinking about creating a part for “ monkees - like ” actor in the show . however , one might impart some truth to the <MASK> in the sense that roddenberry ’ s belief that pravda had run such an editorial might have influenced his decision to make the new character ’ s nationality russian rather than british . on the other hand , one might maintain the <MASK> is literally <MASK> , since there is no <MASK> ( other than hearsay ) that pravda ever published an editorial critical of star trek ‘ s lack of soviet crew members . <PARA> our estimation is that the <MASK> about pravda was not cooked up as a publicity stunt , due to the simple fact that it wasn ’ t publicized at the time . the account of how the chekov character was added to the star trek crew to put those complaining soviets in their place wasn ’ t trumpeted in the media at the time it supposedly happened — as far as we can tell , it was only mentioned in the book the making of star trek ( not exactly a best - seller ) over a year after chekov ’ s debut , hardly a timely or effective way of creating buzz with a cooked - up pr invention . we doubt pravda actually did run an editorial about star trek , but we also doubt that even gene roddenberry would have forged a back - dated letter to support the <MASK> that they did , so we think it likely he genuinely believed they had . how much any of this might have influenced roddenberry ’ s decision to make the added star trek character played by walter koenig a russian , we can ’ t tell at this remove .",1999-03-23T08:00:00+00:00,train_6752,train,misinfo

0,"for years , questions about sea otters ’ alleged propensity toward cross - species sexual violence have passed through snopes ’ inbox . on nov . 25 , 2019 , comedian michele wolfe teased a segment from an upcoming comedy special that presented the assertion that “ otters rape baby seals ” as part of a bit , leading us to finally dive into the <MASK> : <PARA> the <MASK> is supported by firsthand accounts and multiple scientific studies . a 2010 paper , for example , published in the scientific journal aquatic mammals , documented “ nineteen occurrences of interspecific sexual behavior between male southern sea otters and juvenile pacific harbor seals ... in monterey bay , california , between 2000 and 2002 .” that paper documented , for the first time , that otters occasionally inflict enough injury during this “ forced copulation ” that the juvenile seal is killed , as described in this graphic account : <PARA> otters do not direct such violence on juvenile seals only . the above account is similar to an incident described in a 2015 <MASK> in the vancouver sun , except the victim in that case was a pet dog : <PARA> what possible explanation exists for this disturbing behavior ? one theory , proffered by the authors of the study on the monterey bay otters , is that it could be a side effect of the extremely hierarchical behavior of the animal . male otters must compete with other males to gain control of territory and sexually receptive females . as a result , “ males typically establish a dominance hierarchy based on age , size , and relative fitness such that subdominant males will have limited access to receptive females of the same species .” the study authors suggest that an increase in males relative to females could lead subdominant male otters to attempt to mate with individuals of other species , generally female adults or juveniles of either sex , that share the same area . <PARA> at least for monterey bay and the large number of cases of forced otter - seal copulation documented there in the early 2000s , this scenario has some theoretical support . the sex ratio of that population of otters shifted toward being especially male dominated due to a disproportionate number of female deaths in the 5 to 10 years preceding the study period . further , male otters unable to control territory sometimes form “ male groups ” in habitats physically similar to monterey bay . <PARA> of course this does not explain the specific and violent behavior <MASK> in the examples above , nor does it explain the behavior otters partake in with their victims after their death . it bears mentioning , though , that even regular otter - to - otter sex is no picnic , involving sneak attacks and coercive and violent force : <PARA> while we note that “ juvenile seals ” ( as described in the monterey bay study ) are not necessarily “ baby seals ” ( as in unweaned from their mother ), we rank the <MASK> that otters rape “ baby ” seals ( as in young ) as “ <MASK> ” because the phenomenon is well - documented scientifically .",2019-11-27 00:20:16+00:00,test_718,test,info

to 84 - year - olds is 4 , 472 . 6 deaths per 100 , 000 people a year , which would equate to over 100 deaths per 3 , 000 people annually . <PARA> nonetheless , it appears to have shocked the editors at the anti - vaccine website health impact news . in 2013 , that outlet published a <MASK> with the misleading headline “ 23 seniors died after receiving flu shot sold by pharmacies .” snopes continues to get worried inquiries about the <MASK> every flu season . health impact news ’ <MASK> came from the publicly available insert that comes with a specific flu shot marketed as “ fluzone high - dose ,” which discussed the results of scientific testing that went into approving the vaccine for use in 2009 : <PARA> fluzone high - dose , as the name implies , contains more antigens than the regular inactivated influenza virus , thereby creating more antibodies capable of defending the body against influenza . the necessity for such a drug stems from the fact that seniors require more antibodies than younger individuals to fight the flu , and because they die from it at higher rates . the results in the drug insert discussed by health impact news stem from a phase three clinical trial that occurred between 2006 and 2007 and whose results led to approval of the drug . <PARA> health impact news , based on the vaccine insert , makes three poorly formulated assertions under the guise of “ just asking questions .” most of the answers to these questions could have been found by analyzing the publicly available raw data from the clinical trial or by reading the study that was published as a result of that trial : <PARA> as a general rule , a temporal relationship between a vaccination and a death — especially when the considered period of time includes 180 days of follow - up — is not sufficient <MASK> that the vaccination caused that death . a death can be attributable to a vaccination if it appears to have been caused by an established and known scientific mechanism — these are summarized in a 2011 national academies publication and are rooted in rigorous epidemiological data — or if an acute , adverse reaction , such as anaphylactic shock following administration , clearly causes the death . the fact that a senior with an average age of 73 died at some <MORE> days split into two periods of time . the first time period monitored by the researchers lasted 28 days . the second monitoring period lasted the following 152 days . no reasonable person would argue that a person has an equal chance of death — all other issues ignored — over a 28 -

dose and low - dose groups died during the 180 - day monitoring period . <PARA> health impact news spends several paragraphs convincing the reader that giving seniors a higher dose of a flu shot is inherently wrong while ignoring voluminous scientific <MASK> supporting the notion that the elderly need a higher dose , and that such a product could save countless lives . ironically , they then present ( without context ) the results of a study that unequivocally demonstrates that a higher dose did not create any increase in long - term adverse effects but did increase the immunity of seniors . it is <MASK> that 23 people ( out of 3 , 800 ) died during the 180 - day period following vaccination , but this death rate is on par with the u . s . rate for that age group regardless of participation in a trial . <PARA> because no <MASK> is provided for the <MASK> that these 23 deaths were linked in any way to the trial in either health impact news ’ reporting , the raw clinical trial data , or the published report based on that trial , we rank the assertion as “ <MASK> .”",2019-11-01 22:25:04+00:00,test_621,test,misinfo

( abercrombie & fitch is a retailer of men ’ s , women ’ s , and children ’ s clothing and <PARA> accessories , aimed primarily at the teenage and young adult market . abercrombie & fitch was the subject of controversy in 2002 when they offered a line of t - shirts based on asian caricatures .) <PARA> the a & f quarterly available at abercrombie & fitch stores is a magazine - cum - catalog , featuring not only descriptions , pictures , and <PARA> prices of merchandise , but also <MASK> , interviews , and advertisements intended to appeal to a & f ’ s primary market segment ( young adults ) as well as plenty of <PARA> pictures of young people wearing abercrombie & fitch clothing . the winter 2003 edition of a & f quarterly , known as the “ christmas field guide ,” is a hefty 280 pages , only about 100 pages of which are dedicated to catalog material . the first 121 pages include nothing but photographs of models , and the last 60 pages feature <MASK> , interviews , and ads . the content of those first 121 pages is what all the fuss is about . <PARA> as a prelude , we have to say that we saw nothing to indicate that the a & f quarterly is “ targeted to your 10 - to 13 - year - olds .” it isn ’ t given away for free in abercrombie & fitch stores , nor is sent out to customers as a free mailing . the a & f quarterly is available for purchase at a & f outlets ( we paid $ 7 for our copy ) or via subscription . in - store buyers are asked to produce id to demonstrate they are are 18 or older , and the subscription card instructs readers to “ fill out this card and head to the nearest a & f store with a valid photo id ” in order to subscribe . although abercrombie & fitch does also sell children ’ s merchandise , all of the products advertised in the “ christmas field guide <MORE> idiot ’ s guide to amazing sex , in which she gives advice on how college students should approach sex <PARA> and navigate the lack of privacy in student housing , as well as pointers on masturbation , “ sex for three ,” and discreet sex in movie theaters . <PARA> ( abercrombie & fitch even slyly spoofs the content of a & f quarterly in the publication itself . their “ ask a & f ” column includes a missive from someone who supposedly writes : “ i ’ m pretty upset you don ’ t show penises in your catalog . all i see is boobies , boobies , boobies and the occasional buttocks . i want some penises . thank you for your time . please consider putting in some penises . have a great day !”) <PARA> what to make of all this ? whether something like the abercrombie & fitch “ christmas field guide ” is offensive depends upon one ’ s values . some people feel it ’ s never appropriate to use nudity and sexual suggestiveness in advertising , regardless of the product being sold or the age of the target audience . others don ’ t have an issue with this type of advertising as long as it ’ s restricted to venues where only adults are likely to see it ( e . g ., adult magazines whose sales are restricted by age ). some consumers believe it wrong for a company to employ sexually - oriented advertising for adult products if they also market children ’ s products as well . ( that last point seems to be applicable here : even though the products advertised in the “ christmas field guide ” don ’ t appear to be aimed at a pre - teen audience , abercrombie & fitch does have product lines targeted to children .) <PARA> p . s . although we left abercrombie & fitch with nothing but a catalog , barbara still got to do some clothes shopping elsewhere in the mall . <PARA> update : abercrombie & fitch pulled the “ christmas field guide ” from their stores in early december . protest groups <MASK> the act was a result of their campaigning for a boycott over abercrombie & fitch ’ s using the catalog “ as a pretext to sell sexual ideology to teens ,” while an abercrombie & fitch spokesman maintained that the catalog displays was removed because stores needed display space for the launch of a new perfume called now . the “ christmas field guide ” is still available via mail order . <PARA> then , on 10 december 2003 , abercrombie & fitch announced it would stop issuing its racy quarterly catalogues and instead would be unveiling “ an innovative and exciting campaign in the spring .” some industry analysts said the christmas 2003 edition of the publication may have offended too many people , prompting this change .",2010-01-18T06:12:52+00:00,train_3371,train,info

1,"on march 11 , 2020 , researchers in china released a preliminary draft of a study that collected data on the abo blood types of 2 , 173 patients with lab - verified cases of the covid - 19 coronavirus disease from two hospitals in wuhan and one in shenzhen . the researchers compared the distribution of blood types in the infected patients to the distribution of blood types of uninfected people ( as a control group ) from wuhan city and shenzhen city . <PARA> the team analyzed the data in an effort to answer two questions . first , if infection from covid - 19 appeared disproportionately high or low in any blood group ; and second , if instances of death from covid - 19 had any relationship to blood type . the researchers found that : <PARA> these results , which the authors cautioned should not be used to guide clinical practice , came with several caveats . first , this study is a draft of a research paper that has not yet been peer - reviewed or published in any journal . second , the study is limited in both sample size and geographic scope . speaking to the south china morning post , gao yingdai , a tianjin - based researcher not involved in the study , said that while a 2 , 000 - person sample is not necessarily small , it is dwarfed by the number of cases globally . <PARA> tara moriarty , an expert in infectious diseases and immunopathology with the university of toronto , told us by email that the study provides “ an interesting observation that may have an impact on how we identify those most at risk of disease , but until it has been fully peer - reviewed and confirmed / disconfirmed by additional studies , we cannot yet say if blood type affects susceptibility to covid - 19 infection .” <PARA> gao , the tianjin - based researcher , echoed this point with the morning post , saying the results “ may be helpful to medical professionals , but ordinary citizens should not take the <MASK> too seriously ” and that “ if you are type a , there is no need to panic .” <PARA> abo blood type is determined by the the presence or absence of particular sugars and of specific proteins known as antibodies found in the plasma component of blood , as well as the presence or absence of proteins or sugars known as antigens found on the surface of red blood cells . several viral infections , including severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sars ), appear to have a certain affinity for specific blood types . “ blood type groups are associated with differences in vulnerability to infection with multiple viruses , and severity of outcomes , moriarity told us . “ examples include hiv , viruses that cause gastrointestinal illness ( norovirus , rotavirus ), as well as the sars coronavirus that caused the 2002 - 2003 sars outbreak .” <PARA> the exact mechanism behind difference in how viruses respond to blood types is not well - understood , but may involve how antigens and antibodies inhibit or promote a virus binding to the surface of a cell , moriarity said . <PARA> a newer study published in the new england journal of medicine on june 17 , 2020 , confirmed the results of the chinese study , but said more research is needed to establish a conclusive link between blood type and covid - 19 susceptibility . <PARA> in short , ample scientific <MASK> exists for the hypothesis that covid - 19 — or other infections — could affect people differently depending on their blood type . however , such a conclusion cannot be made confidently on the basis of the limited research that has been done so far . as such , we rank this <MASK> about blood types as “ unproven .”",2020-03-20 18:30:08+00:00,test_1143,test,misinfo

1,"castoreum ( or castor , not to be confused with the oil of a castor bean ) is a yellowish - brown , unctuous substance with a strong , penetrating odor which beavers secrete from castor sacs located in skin cavities between the pelvis and the base of the tail and spray when scent - marking their territory . ( the location of the beaver ’ s castor sacs means that castoreum also often includes a mixture of anal gland secretions and urine as well .) due to the beaver ’ s typical diet of leaves and bark , castoreum doesn ’ t “ stink ” as other similar animal secretions do , but rather has a musky , vanilla scent described at the perfume site fragrantica as a “ sharp spreading tar - like note that reminds one of the odor of birch tar or russian leather ” that when diluted in alcohol picks up “ more pleasant , musky and fruity nuances .” <PARA> because of its scent properties castoreum has long been employed in the perfume - making industry , and processed forms of castoreum have also been used as food additives , in the latter case primarily as enhancers of vanilla , strawberry and raspberry flavorings found in products such as iced tea , ice cream , gelatin , candy , fruit - flavored drinks , and yogurt . <PARA> however , the publicity afforded castoreum in recent years via alarmist food activists and “ where does vanilla flavouring come from ? and “ did you know ?” social media posts is vastly overblown : <PARA> the use of castoreum in common food products today is exceedingly rare , in large part because collecting the substance is difficult ( and therefore expensive ): <PARA> according to fernelli ’ s handbook of flavor ingredients , total annual national consumption of castoreum , castoreum extract , and castoreum liquid combined is only about 292 pounds , which works out to an average of less than a millionth of a pound per person in the u . s . compare that figure with the approximately 20 million pounds of vanilla naturally harvested from real vanilla beans every year . depending upon as scarce a substance as castoreum to flavor the ice cream and candy found on store shelves would create nationwide shortages of those items and drive up their prices beyond the reach of all but the wealthiest consumers . <PARA> in 2011 , the vegetarian resource group ( vrg ) queried five companies that produce vanilla flavorings about whether they used any castoreum in their products , and all five replied that they did not : <PARA> castoreum as a food additive is classified by the food and drug administration as “ generally recognized as safe ” ( gras ), and therefore food manufacturers don ’ t always have to include castoreum in their ingredients lists and may instead refer to it as “ natural flavoring .” however yucky that may seem , according to a 2007 safety assessment published the international journal of toxicology , consumption of castoreum poses no health risk to humans : <PARA> castoreum does still have a significant market even today , but almost exclusively for the use of the perfume industry , not the food industry .",2013-02-05T23:21:38+00:00,dev_71,dev,misinfo

0,"the occurrence of a rare form of night cloud is increasing in parts of the world , and may serve as an indication that the presence of human - caused greenhouse gases responsible for climate change is also on the rise in the earth ’ s atmosphere . <PARA> noctilucent ( latin for “ night - shining ”) clouds are typically rare , and are located at a height of around 50 miles ( 80 kilometers ) above earth in a layer of atmosphere known as the mesosphere . these wispy clouds are only visible on clear , summer nights at mid - to high latitudes , and only form under specific conditions , according to the united kingdom metrological office . as water vapor freezes around specks of dust at low mesospheric temperatures , newly formed ice crystals are illuminated from the low - angled sun during dusk and dawn . <PARA> but increasing human - caused pollutants — like methane and particulate matter — means that both the amount of water vapor and levels of dust in the atmosphere are also on the rise , spurring an increase in the occurrence of noctilucent clouds . <PARA> dust can come from man - made pollutants , as well as natural processes such as dust left behind from passing meteors or matter projected into the atmosphere from volcanoes . on the other hand , water vapor can come both from the earth ’ s surface through natural mechanisms or via methane , which produces water vapor through chemical reactions that occur in the atmosphere . as such , a 2018 study published in the journal geophysical research letters found that noctilucent clouds may serve as an indicator of human - caused climate change . <PARA> to come to their conclusions , researchers with the american geophysical union ran computer models and satellite observations to simulate how greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels have contributed to an increased occurrence of noctilucent clouds over the last 150 years . since the dawn of the industrial revolution , it appears that methane emissions have increased water vapor concentration by about 40 percent , contributing to more than double the amount of mesospheric ice . <PARA> “ we speculate that the clouds have always been there , but the chance to see one was very , very poor , in historical times ,” said franz - josef lübken , an atmospheric scientist at the leibniz institute of atmospheric physics in kühlungsborn , germany , in a <MASK> . <PARA> though the presence of noctilucent clouds fluctuates every year , they were shown to become more frequent over the course of the study period , confirming similar findings published in a 1989 edition of nature . together , the studies provide a sign that the burning of fossil fuels appears to be affecting natural processes reaching high into earth ’ s atmosphere . <PARA> the authors caution that observing interactions in the mesosphere is rather challenging .” little is known about trends over long periods of time and databases documenting long - term trends is “ still rather poor .” that being said , the researchers argue that modern technologies and increasing observational data in recent decades provide further <MASK> that human - caused greenhouse gases may increase the likelihood of noctilucent cloud formation . <PARA> in 2020 , the start of the arctic noctilucent cloud season began on may 17 , which nasa reports is the second - earliest start of the northern season that researchers have observed . polar mesospheric clouds typically stay close to the earth ’ s poles , but were seen as far south as california and oklahoma in 2019 , the washington post reported at the time , and appear to be “ forming earlier and spreading farther each year .”",2020-07-13 21:14:35+00:00,test_277,test,info
1,"although many folk beliefs take root worldwide , some remain peculiar to specific cultures . such is the case of the south korean conviction about “ fan death ,” a deadly fate said to await those who sleep nights in rooms where electric fans are left running . <PARA> there are three primary theories as to why leaving a fan running in a closed room overnight might kill a person . none holds up to medical scrutiny , yet that does not impede belief in them : <PARA> fans don ’ t chill air . they merely circulate it , which means the hypothermia theory doesn ’ t survive even the first hurdle of fan use causing a marked drop in room temperature , let alone the second of such a drop being enough to lower a person ’ s internal temperature from 37 ° c ( 98 . 6 ° f ) to below 30 ° c ( 86 ° f ). <PARA> both the suffocation and carbon dioxide theories fail on the fact that homes are far from airtight . unless a dwelling is purposely constructed to be airtight , sufficient air should leak into and out of it to prevent suffocation . <PARA> there are other , more loony , theories about what causes fan death . one asserts the fan ’ s blades chop up oxygen molecules , rendering such mutilated air unbreathable . another posits the fan converts oxygen into carbon dioxide . <PARA> no other culture appears to regard its electric fans with trepidation , yet the belief that these air circulating devices are capable of killing in their sleep even adult men is rampant among koreans . it doesn ’ t help that the korean media continues to report “ fan deaths ,” citing this form of demise every time an otherwise healthy - appearing individual is found dead in his bed . <PARA> as to how seriously the threat of fan death is taken in south korea , fan users there are cautioned to always leave a window open to counter the otherwise deadly effects . korea ’ s largest fan manufacturing concern , shinil industrial co ., issues warnings with its products telling customers to keep fans pointed away from people at night . “ this product may cause suffocation or hypothermia ,” the warning reads . the korea consumer protection board advises that “ doors should be left open when sleeping with the electric fan or air conditioner turned on . if bodies are exposed to electric fans or air conditioners for too long , it causes bodies to lose water and hypothermia .” many fans sold in south korea are equipped with timers so people don ’ t fall asleep with the units running all night . fan death fear is so prevalent that some korean drivers have made it their practice to open car windows a crack before operating their vehicles ’ air conditioners . <PARA> we can only speculate on where this belief came from . the first report of fan death dates to the early 1970s , a time when south korea was struggling to handle higher energy prices . it ’ s possible the government in place back then spread the <MASK> as a way of discouraging folks from running fans at night . <PARA> faith in fan death continues to run strong in south korea because people everywhere yearn for the comfort of easily - grasped explanations when bad things occur , and fan death provides koreans with that for a number of otherwise mysterious deaths . in any country , a handful of seemingly healthy individuals will be discovered dead in their beds , the cause of their demise not readily apparent . in south korea , a country that gets hot and humid in the summer , many homes will contain electric fans which , with their owners now dead , will be still running in the morning when the bodies are discovered . yet the one ( fan still running ) doesn ’ t cause the other ( sudden mysterious death ); the two are independent events . as to what actually causes these mysterious deaths , the smart money is on previously undiagnosed heart problems or drug or alcohol abuse . <PARA> the most telling argument against fan death is that people in other countries where fans are used overnight don ’ t die of it .",2008-09-05T07:00:00+00:00,dev_85,dev,misinfo

1,"<MASK> : domino ’ s , a multi - million dollar chain of pizza restaurants , began in 1960 with a $ 500 investment by two brothers in a ypsilanti , michigan , pizza parlor called dominick ’ s . from those humble <MASK> the company has grown into an international chain , now operating thousands of outlets in more than fifty countries . <PARA> during its formative years , one of the ways domino ’ s sought to increase its market share among the u . s . pizza - buying public was to offer a guarantee on the speed of its delivery , thereby enticing consumers to order from domino ’ s in preference to one of its many competitors . that guarantee , which began in 1979 , was “ 30 minutes or it ’ s free .” under that policy , customers won either way : they received pizzas that arrived within a half - hour of ordering , assuring them of hot , fresh product for their money , or they received pizzas that might not have been as hot or as fresh , but without charge . <PARA> in 1993 , in reaction to multi - million dollar settlements arising from car accidents involving its delivery drivers , domino ’ s ended its delivery guarantee . while the pizza maker never admitted its drivers drove unsafely in their efforts to beat the 30 - minute deadline , at a 1993 news conference domino ’ s owner thomas s . monaghan said the guarantee was being dropped in an attempt to fight a “ public perception of reckless driving and irresponsibility .” <PARA> that perception was fueled by a couple of key lawsuits against domino ’ s . in 1992 , the company agreed to pay $ 2 . 8 million to the family of an indiana woman killed by one of its delivery people . the woman , 41 - year - old susan noonan wauchop of calumet city , illinois , died when a domino ’ s truck struck her van near the indiana - michigan border in 1990 , an accident that also injured three of her sons and a friend . domino ’ s has always maintained that road and weather conditions , not the delivery time requirements , were the primary factors behind that crash . <PARA> yet it was a case ruled upon in 1993 that rang down the curtain on the “ 30 minutes or it ’ s free ” guarantee . an injury to a 49 - year - old st . louis , missouri , woman , whose car was struck by a domino ’ s <PARA> driver in 1989 , led to an award of $ 750 , 000 in actual damages and $ 78 million in punitive damages against the pizza company . jean kinder , the injured driver , had suffered injuries to her head and back after the driver of the pizza delivery vehicle ran a red light and struck her vehicle . <PARA> available information indicates that kinder did not receive the full $ 78 , 750 , 000 awarded to her but instead chose to settle for $ 15 million ( with the local franchise holder ponying up $ 9 million and domino ’ s the other $ 6 million ), but this information cannot be confirmed . a reason why she might have decided to accept this much smaller amount is because , had she not done so , the verdict would have been appealed , and large punitive awards granted by juries often don ’ t survive the appeals process since appellate courts are free to reduce or even eliminate such awards . in kinder ’ s case , she might have felt that a $ 15 million bird in the hand was better than a $ 78 million one in the bush . <PARA> human nature being what it is , the accidents that resulted in the demise of the guarantee are now recalled in a way that better suits them to serve as fodder for an explanatory tale : the deceased 41 - year - old woman and the severely injured 49 - year - old woman are transformed into a small child , and their accidents ( which involved vehicles colliding with other vehicles ) become an instance of a pizza delivery driver running down a youngster who had been walking alongside the road or attempting to cross the street . in this way , the horrific is made even more horrific ; the mind ’ s eye is left contemplating the lifeless body of a little kid lying in the road . in this manner , the essence of the reason for the guarantee ’ s having been rescinded becomes far easier to grasp than it does when <MASK> in more nebulous terms of lawsuits settled out of court and open questions of who really was at fault . <PARA> domino ’ s still offers its customers a guarantee that they will be satisfied with the product , but it is a quality guarantee rather than a time - dependent one . says the company ’ s total satisfaction guarantee : “ if for any reason you are dissatisfied with your domino ’ s pizza dining experience , we will re - make your pizza or refund your money .” <PARA> barbara “ i ’ ll tell them my dining companion was a poor conversationalist and demand a refund ” mikkelson",2014-07-22T02:50:06+00:00,train_6652,train,misinfo

0,"<MASK> : used underwear that has supposedly been previously worn by schoolgirls is being offered for sale in vending machines in japan . though we don ’ t know the current price for such items , in 1993 they sold for the equivalent of us $ 50 apiece . <PARA> we ’ d read that this practice ended in 1993 and reported as much in the <MASK> of this <MASK> ( which was penned in 2001 ), but since that time numerous readers living in japan have written to say that not only haven ’ t the machines gone away , but that they ’ ve themselves seen them . <PARA> japan is home to a thriving bura - sera industry — <PARA> of which traffic in the soiled panties of schoolgirls represents only one part — with “ bura - sera ” or “ buru - sera ” the term for a specific male fascination relating to that country ’ s schoolgirls . “ buru ” is anglicized japanese ( japlish ) for “ bloomers ” and “ sera ” for “ sailor ”; the term refers to the sailor suit , the predominant style of girls ’ junior and high school uniforms . dozens , if not hundreds , of magazines are exclusively devoted to bura - sera photographs , pictures that feature girls clad in school garb , holding up their skirts to display their panties . usually in such photos the girls ’ faces are hidden , but that is not always the case . <PARA> girlish youth and innocence are considered sexy in japan , a culture with a long <MASK> of regarding women more as sex toys than as people . this obsession with untouched adolescence results in the sad sight of women in their thirties emitting girlish giggles and clutching teddy bears in an effort to maintain their appeal to the opposite sex . although it can fairly be said western society also prizes youth in a woman , there the fascination has to do more with the looks of a girl than it does with her immaturity and presumed sexual innocence . a pretty 26 - year - old who would be considered lovely in the west would in japan be viewed by many as hopelessly long in the tooth . <PARA> western society looks for firm , youthful bodies housing the attitudes of grown women — we like them young , but we don ’ t like them to act young . in the west , a teen ’ s sex appeal is dependent upon her ability to look and act much older , thus the fascination with makeup and plunging necklines , accoutrements that make her appear less of a child and more of a woman . in japan , this ideal is reversed — sexy in the land of the rising sun adds up to childlike behavior and modes of dress that express this ideal . sometimes this amounts <MORE> there is no guarantee that all the panties marketed as having been worn by schoolgirls actually have been . such details are not scrupulously vetted ; no regulatory body checks to ensure the veracity of <MASK> made about these items . however , it is clear that at least some of the used undies do come from teen girls , thus this “ underwear of a japanese schoolgirl ” <MASK> is no myth . <PARA> japan has a tradition of vending through machines what western society would view as unusual consumables . in addition to the many items one would typically expect to find offered for sale in this manner , porn magazines , disposable cameras , new pantyhose , horoscopes , and many other goods are routinely mechanically vended . <PARA> part of the appeal of such machines is attributable to a matter of convenience , but concern for privacy also fuels the mania . there is less chance of embarrassment in buying condoms from a machine than from a store where the sale must be rung up and bagged by a clerk . likewise , purchases of “ pink ” videos ( what in the west are termed “ blue movies ”) are less likely to be blush - producing experiences when these transactions can be effected without anyone else ’ s looking on . <PARA> there was thus a waiting market for “ schoolgirl panties ” machines , in that those looking to obtain such items would not have to brave a bura - sera shop to fulfill their desires . these mechanical points of sale appeared in 1993 in chiba city ( chiba prefecture ), in an area known for its porn magazine and adult video vending machines . almost immediately , an outcry was raised against them , but there was a problem in getting them removed : whereas sellers required licenses to distribute other types of goods , no such requirement was on the books for soiled underwear , because no one had foreseen the possibility of trade in such an item . these machines existed outside the law in the sense that no specific <MASK> existed that could be invoked to combat them . <PARA> the solution was as creative as it is odd - sounding — the machines were countered by invoking the antique dealings law , a <MASK> which stipulates that an antique dealer or a dealer in second - hand items must obtain permission from local authorities . lacking those permissions , the items could not be vended . <PARA> in september 1993 , three businessmen were charged with selling used panties without a permit under the provenance of this law . this supposedly ended the presence of such salespoints in that country , but like we said at the top of this piece , countless readers have since written to tell us that the machines can still be found . <PARA> barbara “ vend me your rears ” mikkelson",2010-01-12T20:11:46+00:00,train_2054,train,info

and the chyron ( or caption ) at the bottom of the screen in that moment , which read “ biden pitches crucial latino voters during florida campaign stop .” <PARA> the photograph was authentic . it was taken in phoenix , arizona , on sept . 14 , 2020 , by associated press photographer andrew harnik with the caption : “ supporters react as president donald trump speaks at a latinos for trump coalition roundtable at arizona grand resort & spa ...” <PARA> the screenshot from “ cbs evening news ” was also authentic , and apparently undoctored . it <MASK> in the sept . 15 , 2020 , episode of the program , which can be watched in full here . the chyron can be seen throughout the segment in question , which is available to watch , below : <PARA> ducharme ’ s <MASK> was that cbs had , through its use of the chyron , presented the photograph as depicting a biden event , but that omitted one crucial element of any television news segment — audio . <PARA> during the <MORE> discussing concerns among biden supporters that his campaign had not done enough grassroots outreach among latino voters in florida , and that the trump campaign had been doing more . at the moment when the phoenix “ latinos for trump ” photograph shows up on screen , o ’ keefe says : “ the president has cut into biden ’ s advantage by wooing conservative latinos ...” <PARA> so “ cbs evening news ” actually used the “ latinos for trump ” photograph for the exact opposite reason to the one <MASK> <MASK> by ducharme and others : it showed up at a point in the report when o ’ keefe was mentioning trump ’ s support among latino supporters — an entirely appropriate usage of that photograph . <PARA> a considerable degree of irony exists in the fact that the <MASK> <MASK> that cbs misrepresented the photograph by taking it from its <MASK> context , was itself perpetrated by taking the screenshot from the “ cbs evening news ” report , and removing it from its proper context by stripping away the voiceover narration . <PARA> it ’ s <MASK> that the chyron “ biden pitches crucial latino voters during florida campaign stop ” remained present at the bottom of the screen during the moment in question , but it causes no confusion when viewed in its proper context , along with the voiceover . it ’ s also standard practice for the same chyron to remain present throughout the course of a cable news segment , even if it doesn ’ t describe or relate to each and every image shown . <PARA> for example , it could hardly be reasonably <MASK> that “ cbs evening news ” engaged in dishonesty by having the chyron at the bottom of the screen while the following image of trump showed up , on the basis that the image showed trump , and not “ biden pitching to latino voters ”: <PARA> after this fact check was published , gateway pundit completely overhauled their <MASK> , changing the headline to “ trump ’ s cut into the hispanic vote leaves democrats panicked ,” removing ducharme ’ s tweet and stripping away any substantive mention of the cbs evening news segment until the final line in the revised <MASK> , which read : “ cbs news had to use a photo from a trump rally because virtually no one was at joe biden ’ s latino event !” <PARA> despite the radical edit to the <MASK> , and the substantially reduced word count , gateway pundit still managed to mislead readers with that <MASK> . cbs news was not forced to use a photo from a trump rally because a comparable biden event had been poorly attended , the network used the “ latinos for trump ” photograph because , as we have made clear , they were illustrating trump ’ s support among latinos during that portion of the report .",2020-09-17 15:15:40+00:00,test_581,test,misinfo

1,"in october 2020 , readers asked snopes to look into allegations made by isabella maria deluca , a republican activist who <MASK> she was assaulted by left - wing protesters at the oct . 17 “ women ’ s march ” in washington d . c . <PARA> on oct . 17 , deluca , who is outreach director for the conservative group republicans for national renewal , wrote on twitter : “ i just got punched in the face and choked by two women because i was holding a trump flag here at the supreme court .” <PARA> deluca attended a counterprotest against the women ’ s march at the u . s . supreme court on oct . 17 that was organized to express opposition to u . s . president donald trump and any u . s . senate confirmation of the appointment of amy coney barrett to the supreme court . deluca carried a flag that read “ trump 2020 — keep america great ,” as shown in footage recorded by the website breitbart . <PARA> later on the day of the protest , deluca posted photographs of herself wearing a neck brace , one of which also showed what appeared to be a bloodied mouth and contusions on her chin and right cheek . on oct . 19 , she posted a short video of herself with what appeared to be bruising on her chin , mouth , and left cheek . <PARA> on oct . 18 , the pulitzer prize - winning photographer carol guzy posted two photographs of deluca , the captions of which described her as having suffered a “ bloodied mouth after a scuffle with marchers .” <PARA> deluca ’ s experience formed the basis of several news reports by right - wing websites , all of which unambiguously presented her as the victim of a politically motivated assault by left - wing and black lives matter ( blm ) protesters . on oct . 18 , she gave further details about the incident to the national file : <PARA> the blaze posted an <MASK> with the headline “ women ’ s march , blm activists reportedly pummel female trump supporter , who ends up hospitalized for head , neck injuries ,” while rf angle , a right -

1,"“ tilapia ” is the market name of a variety of mild - flavored , inexpensive freshwater fish species commercially farmed , harvested , and consumed throughout the world . as of 2016 , it was the fourth most popular seafood species eaten in the united <MASK> . <PARA> despite the recognized health benefits of consuming tilapia ( and fish generally ), however , the product has been maligned by <MASK> that the farm -

raised versus wild - caught fish , mainly due to questionable aquacultural practices that can result in fish diseases , which some producers treat with antibiotics . however , environmental defense fund scientist tim fitzgerald told the new york times in 2014 that fish farming practices have been improving , and alert consumers can find “ healthy and eco - friendly farmed options ” by choosing their merchants carefully . fitzgerald recommended aiming for a mix of both wild and farmed seafood for best results . <PARA> tilapia fish are mostly vegetarian and subsist on algae and freshwater plants in the wild , although , as the meme indicates , under aquacultural conditions they are fed corn and soybeans . given that the vast majority of corn and soybean varieties grown worldwide are now genetically manipulated to be herbicide - tolerant and insect resistant , unless otherwise labeled the likelihood that farm - raised tilapia have eaten genetically modified products is quite high . <PARA> there is no scientific <MASK> to support the assumption that feeding farm - raised tilapia genetically engineered products makes the fish unsafe for humans to consume , however . in an <MASK> published on the u . s . department of agriculture ( usda ) web site , iowa <MASK> university food scientist ruth s . macdonald notes that there is no <MASK> that altered dna from gmo feed is transferred to the animals that consume it , nor that gmo foods generally pose a health risk to human beings . the scientific consensus on gmo safety remains strong . <PARA> the <MASK> that eating tilapia “ is worse than eating bacon or a hamburger ” appears to have been gleaned from web sites reacting to a 2008 study pointing out that farm - raised tilapia offers a less desirable ratio of health - promoting omega - 3 fatty acids to potentially inflammatory omega - 6 fatty acids . a summary of the research said : <PARA> we hasten to note that there is an obvious difference between saying that the inflammatory potential of hamburger and bacon is lower than that of tilapia , and saying that eating tilapia is “ worse ” than eating those other foods . more importantly , the overall implications of the study have been challenged by other experts . sanford health nutrition researcher william s . harris wrote that despite its particular fatty acid content , eating tilapia is still a healthy choice , and replacing it with bacon , hamburgers , or donuts is “ absolutely not recommended ”: <PARA> according to walter c . willett , professor of nutrition at harvard school of public health , the authors of the tilapia study overlooked the established health benefits of omega -

1,"asthma is an inflammatory disorder of the bronchial tubes that affects more than 17 million americans and causes more than 5 , 000 deaths per year . it is also the most common chronic childhood disorder , affecting 6 . 3 million children ( approximately 1 in 13 school - aged kids ). <PARA> although numerous medications exist that work to keep asthma in check , there is no cure for this malady . because not all asthma medications are equally effective on all sufferers , it is therefore to be expected that at least some who live with this illness look to the world of folk medicine and superstition for relief from the crushing inability to breathe . <PARA> in addition to various herbs , nostrums , and rituals said to alleviate asthma symptoms , a surprisingly widespread belief positions one particular breed of man ’ s best friend as an asthma cure . chihuahuas , it is said , will take asthma out of a home , either their presence working to wipe out the disease , or the animals themselves soaking up the illness resident in human masters and so transferring it to themselves . ( the <MASK> exists in both forms : something about these dogs kills asthma , or <PARA> chihuahuas serve as canine illness sponges .) <PARA> consequently , many families of asthmatic children have rushed to purchase these dogs and install them as family pets . some believers in this cure insist the child must sleep with the chihuahua if the remedy is to be effected ; others also specify that the dog must lie on the child ’ s chest . <PARA> when those who pass along the news of this cure advance a source for their information , they will often says that the chihuahua remedy began with the aztecs . some will add that the aztecs revered the chihuahua as the “ ruler of the nose ” and thought it had the power to cure various ailments in addition to asthma . impressive as that sounds , there ’ s only scant reason to believe aztecs had anything to do with the development of the belief that this particular dog would cure this particular disease . <PARA> the aztecs certainly did like this little dog : while it is <MASK> that the chihuahua started out as a foodstuff for them , the small canine eventually came to be regarded as a spiritual guide that would help a dead aztec make his way in the afterlife , with part of that process involving the animal ’ s absorbing the sins of the person who ’ d died . this information bears enough of a resemblance to the “ chihuahuas cure asthma ” <MASK> ( i . e ., it involves the notion that chihuahuas were used to take on something noxious their human masters wanted to be rid of ) that the aztec connection cannot be completely dismissed <PARA> more plausible is the explanation that the <MASK> became attached to this particular pooch because a great many chihuahuas wheeze and make breathing noises the sound like someone struggling with asthma . it can therefore sound ( especially to those desperate for a cure ) that the dog is drawing the asthma from the sufferer and taking it up himself . ( for worried pet owners out there , we note that this not the case : asthma does not get passed from human to dog .) <PARA> unfortunately for asthma sufferers , the chihuahua remedy doesn ’ t work . while it is <MASK> that these creatures are somewhat less likely to provoke allergies than most other breeds of dogs , owning one will not in itself cure asthma . ( even in terms of providing canine companionship for allergy sufferers , these short - haired dogs aren ’ t a magic bullet : they can still stir up all the usual symptoms of asthma because it ’ s not fur that is the allergen ; it ’ s substances contained in dander and bodily secretions . however , smaller dogs and dogs with single - layered coats generally produce less dander , and chihuahuas possess both these qualities .) <PARA> the belief about chihuahuas as an asthma cure has been around for a very long time ; we found it written up in a 1956 folklore journal and a 1965 medical journal . one of the reasons for the <MASK> ’ s longevity has to do with the nature of asthma in children : about half of young sufferers lose their symptoms sometime during childhood or adolescence . that inexplicable loss , coupled with <PARA> the presence in the home of the four - legged asthma cure ( the chihuahua ), works to entrench belief in the fiction that the dog cures the disease . <PARA> in this sense , the belief is akin to the various “ wart cures “ that folklore advocates for the treatment of children afflicted with such bumpy growths : the body ’ s eventual triumph over the virus is mistakenly attributed to some external cure , such as rubbing these benign skin tumors with bean pods or snails or wishing them onto the occupants of passing hearses . <PARA> beliefs that canines can be pressed into accepting human illness and thereby freeing human sufferers from their physical maladies are quite old . for instance , an 1898 folklore journal examined a midwestern folk remedy that <MASK> : “ the negro sometimes sleeps with a young dog in order to transmit rheumatism to the dog .”",2008-05-21T07:00:00+00:00,train_4858,train,misinfo

1,"in 2017 , the conspiracy - peddling neon nettle junk news website published an <MASK> headlined “ harvard study proves unvaccinated children pose no risk .” <PARA> the referenced “ study ” was , in fact , not a study but rather an “ open letter ” penned by a woman named tetyana obukhanych and published on the anti - vaccine website thinking moms ’ revolution — a site that promotes a $ 2 , 000 . 00 “ ion detox ” machine as a treatment for autism . obukhanych ’ s letter , first published in 2015 , continues to be shared and re - shared online despite its numerous shortcomings . <PARA> we will discuss obukhanych ’ s academic background toward the end of this post , as such details matter less than the content of the misleading or <MASK> <MASK> made in her open letter , which we will address one - by - one . broadly , obukhanych argues that laws requiring mandatory vaccinations for schoolchildren are misguided because most vaccines included in such laws ( in her estimation ) do not prevent the transmission of disease , and therefore an unvaccinated child would pose no added risk to a vaccinated child in a school setting : <PARA> obukhanych ’ s repeated refrain is that accepting ( or , more to the point , rejecting ) these vaccines “ cannot alter the safety of public spaces ,” such as schools , because they afford only personal protection . the result is a viral <MASK> that provides a highly shareable but flawed justification to parents for use against other parents who accuse them of endangering their children by not vaccinating them . in most cases , obukhanych ’ s reasoning is problematic and her conclusions unsupported by science . <PARA> tetanus , as <MASK> in obukhanych ’ s post , is a non - communicable disease . vaccination against tetanus , which is caused by the release of a toxin produced by c . tetani bacteria , does not prevent the spread of those bacteria ; it merely affords one ’ s body the ability to destroy the toxin they produce . <PARA> that fact does mean a child without a tetanus vaccination poses no additional risk to others . it is worth mentioning , however , that 2 in 10 people who develop tetanus die from the disease , and that the tetanus vaccine ( which is generally included in a three - vaccine combination ) is uncontroversially safe for use in nearly all populations . <PARA> obukhanych attempts to make a similar argument against hepatitis b vaccination , arguing that since it is a blood - borne disease , it is unlikely to be spread amongst children : <PARA> obukhanych confidently asserts that hepatitis b does not “ spread in a community setting ,” but while non - sexual and non - needle based transmissions are rare , they are not impossible , as the <MORE> it provides <MASK> the ipv vaccine does not protect against the wild poliovirus . she does this to make the clever - sounding argument that a vaccinated child might pose a risk to unvaccinated children , but she does so by ignoring everything but a single sentence found in a single diagram in a lengthy new england journal of medicine study that sought to address the vaccine ’ s effectiveness against wild polioviruses . <PARA> in her post , she references a footnote to a table showing the viral load of the feces of a control group of infants and a group treated with ipv after they were inoculated with opv . her interpretation of the figure is that “ high counts of live virus were recovered from the stool of children in all groups , [ making ] it clear that ipv cannot be relied upon for the control of polioviruses .” <PARA> in fact , the study ’ s authors viewed those results as <MASK> of ipvs success against wild poliovirus strains , which ( not to put too fine a point on it ) is the opposite of the argument she <MASK> the paper is making ( emphasis ours ): <PARA> the world health organization ’ s view tracks that study ’ s view of ipv as well , <MASK> that it “ has been used successfully to eradicate polio in a few countries , notably in scandinavia and the netherlands , [ and that in the ] numerous countries that have been introduced to ipv over the last decade no <MASK> of continued circulation of poliovirus strains has been observed , indicating that ipv may successfully inhibit community transmission of poliovirus .” <PARA> obukhanych bills herself as a recovering “ mainstream ” academic who has seen the error of her field ’ s ways . she <MASK> a phd in epidemiology from the rockefeller university in new york and <MASK> on her patreon page that she “ held postdoctoral research training appointments in prominent immunology laboratories affiliated with harvard medical school and stanford university school of medicine .” her publication record supports the notion that she held positions at , or worked with , these institutions , though she has few publications to her name . <PARA> despite not being a physician , she is a “ founding director ” of physicians for informed consent ( an organization described in multiple science - based medical blogs as a “ radical anti - vaccine ” group ), and she has produced a self - published e - book titled vaccine illusion : how vaccination compromises our natural immunity and what we can do to regain our health . she also sells access to her teleconferenced lectures for $ 20 . 00 a month . <PARA> describing her “ open letter ” published on an anti - vaccine blog as a “ harvard study ” is , in our view , quite a bit of a stretch .",2018-08-14T16:15:02+00:00,train_4403,train,misinfo

1,"a facet of u . s . <MASK> largely unfamiliar to americans themselves is the role of indentured servitude in the survival and growth of the <MASK> 13 colonies . the earliest settlers needed laborers , but only wealthy people could afford passage to the new world . this led to a system whereby those who lacked means were brought from europe under contract to work off their passage , room , and board over a period of two to seven years , until they were considered to have earned their freedom . no fewer than half of the immigrants who came to the new world during the colonial period arrived as indentured servants . <PARA> among the many thousands of impoverished europeans brought over in this fashion were men , women , and children from england , ireland , scotland , germany , and elsewhere , but over the intervening centuries the notion has arisen that the irish , in particular , were shipped to the new world as “ white slaves .” <PARA> in fact , according to an <MASK> first published on the internet in 2008 and endlessly recirculated since , irish slaves were not only common in early america , they were more common than african slaves , and often treated more harshly . the <MASK> making these <MASK> is usually credited to an individual named john martin , who , in turn , found most of his “ facts ” in a 2003 <MASK> by james f . cavanaugh called “ irish slaves in the caribbean .” it has gone by many names , but as of mid - 2016 , the most shared version of the irish slave narrative was entitled “ irish : the forgotten white slaves ,” and posted under the byline of a man named ronald dwyer . <PARA> regardless of who is or isn ’ t credited with writing it , nearly every iteration of the piece begins in exactly the same way : <PARA> woven throughout is the implication that the reason so few americans know anything about the so - called “ forgotten ” <MASK> of irish slavery is that it has been excluded from “ biased ” <MASK> books . <PARA> limerick - based research librarian and historian liam hogan takes aim at this notion in a series of papers debunking what he calls “ the irish slaves myth .” there were no irish slaves in the americas , hogan says . people who <MASK> there were are conflating indentured servitude with chattel slavery — two distinct forms of servitude with more differences between them than similarities : <PARA> hogan pins a 2014 resurgence of the irish slaves narrative to increasing racial tensions within the united <MASK> , situating it within a larger world view desirous of absolving white europeans of blame for the transatlantic slave trade that brought an estimated 12 million africans to the new world in lifelong bondage : <PARA> that the institution of <MORE> “ african ,” according to the encyclopedia britannica : <PARA> the dred scott decision handed down by the supreme court in 1857 reaffirmed that racialized definition of slavery . the 7 to 2 decision in scott v . sanford held that plaintiff dred scott , a black slave , did not qualify as an american citizen and had no standing to sue in federal court because , in part , persons imported as slaves “ had for more than a century before been regarded as beings of an inferior order ”: <PARA> in terms of historical accuracy , the irish slave <MASK> is a hodgepodge . for example , the “ proclamation of 1625 ” supposedly requiring all irish prisoners to be sent overseas did not exist . you won ’ t find it in any <MASK> books . there was a 1603 proclamation by james i ordering that “ rogues , vagabonds , idle , and dissolute persons ” be “ banished and conveyed ” to “ places and parts beyond the seas ,” etc ., but this was not directed at the irish in particular . it was put to use decades later in the wake of the english civil wars , however , as a justification for forcibly shipping thousands of irish prisoners , vagrants , and orphans to the caribbean as indentured servants . more than any other , this historical fact inspired the notion that the irish were enslaved . still , the text wildly exaggerates the number of those treated in this fashion , <MASK> <MASK> that “ 300 , 000 were sold as slaves .” ( liam hogan unravels these and similar <MASK> misrepresentations in “ a review of the numbers in the irish slaves meme .”) <PARA> that thousands of irish people were carried across the sea against their will and indentured to serve on plantations isn ’ t disputed . it happened . what ’ s in question is whether or not they are rightly referred to as “ slaves .” some writers , such as genealogist and irish times columnist john grenham , ask why not : <PARA> is it mere quibbling ?

only the red dorsal stripe distinguishes them . <PARA> redbacks are found everywhere throughout the australian continent , especially alongside human habitation . <PARA> only females build webs . their smaller , less brilliantly colored male counterparts often lurk to the side . <PARA> humans must be careful . the spider won ’ t seek out people to sting , but should a hand stray into her web by accident , a trip to the emergency room may be in order as the venom acts directly on the nerves . <PARA> only the female bite is dangerous , and their bites have caused some human deaths . <PARA> the redback possesses a potent neurotoxic venom . it does not hunt its prey , but instead waits for a tasty morsel to wander by and become entangled in its web . <PARA> once the prey - usually a walking insect - becomes enmeshed in the redback ’ s web , it ’ s wrapped in silk . when it ’ s time to eat , the spider bites down on its intended victim , injecting its neurotoxic venom . the venom paralyzes the insect , and digestive enzymes begin to dissolve the prey ’ s insides . <PARA> antivenom for redback spider bites has been available since 1956 , and no known deaths directly attributable to redback bites have been documented in more than fifty years since then , which makes this latest case in ireland quite a subject of interest . however , note that the victim ’ s wife , jeanne , <MASK> her husband didn ’ t die soon after being bitten by a spider ; he had actually been bitten a year earlier , and then he experienced a long period of declining health with various symptoms before finally passing away in july 2014 : <PARA> “ but the bite he got had bled very badly . we went through a roll and a half of toilet roll to try and stop it . <PARA> “ ever since his health went down . <PARA> “ his stomach started swelling , they said it was his liver and his pancreas . <PARA> “ his testicles also swelled up very bad .” <PARA> jeanne , 46 , went on to describe how john ’ s eyesight deteriorated and he started vomiting blood . <PARA> he eventually died in hospital last month and an inquest into his death has begun — but jeanne is already convinced it was the spider . <PARA> “ it had to be down to that sting . <PARA> “ he was in perfect health before the bite happened .” <PARA> so there ’ s as yet no certainty that john francis kennedy was actually bitten by a redback spider , which had not previously been sighted in ireland , other than someone ’ s year - old recollection of what the spider in question looked like . and even if that species of spider did deliver a bite to the victim , it ’ s unproven at this point that his death was directly attributable to that bite . he may have died from something else completely coincidental to that bite , he may have been suffering from an undiagnosed medical condition that had already compromised his health and was exacerbated or compounded by the bite ’ s effects , or he may have suffered an allergic reaction to the bite ( rather than being killed by the venom itself ) — a host of alternative explanations are possible . <PARA> until additional ( and less tabloid - sensational ) details are provided about this case , it ’ s far too early to <MASK> this as a verified example of a redback spider bite death in ireland . and for those locals who fear that such critters are taking up residence in the area : <PARA> currently there are no national records of redback spider sightings .",-0001-11-30T00:00:00+00:00,dev_158,dev,misinfo

third of the restoration budget just to install those windows ,” says spear . then he realized the building code said nothing about what colors the old victorians should be painted . so as a show of his anger , and as a protest against what he says are unfair regulations , he painted one home all black , and the adjacent home with an american flag theme . they <MORE> there with his wife and seven adopted children . he said they changed the color of their house after getting into a dispute with the city ’ s code enforcement . <PARA> a few months ago , code enforcement officers said they went to the home acting on an anonymous tip . <PARA> “ late february , we received a complaint about a dead christmas tree on the balcony ,” said volker reiss , community services and code compliance manager for city of bradenton . <PARA> reiss said his officers asked the family to remove it and they complied . <PARA> greer said to his surprise , they were told about more violations . <PARA> the city sent greer a two page letter , listing several violations at the home . some of the issues were about missing window screens , painting , pressure washing , loose railings , and trash on the property . <PARA> greer said while everything was upsetting , one complaint made him furious . he said he was told his home ’ s exterior painting was not up to city standards . <PARA> the greers do not live in a deed -

1,"<MASK> : three out of four people will develop a wart at some time in their lives , making warts the second most common dermatological complaint , after acne . children and young adults are more prone to developing these bumpy growths than are adults , but anyone can catch them at any time in his or <PARA> her life . they are the essence of caprice in that they sprout without warning and usually go away within a year . yet there ’ s no magic ( evil or otherwise ) to their arrival — they are the results of a virus . <PARA> warts are benign skin tumors caused by human papilloma viruses , germs that enter the skin through cuts or scratches and cause cells to multiply rapidly . they are slightly contagious and can be spread to other parts of the body by touch , and they can be passed to others the same way . most warts disappear without treatment because the body ’ s immune system eventually kicks in to defeat the virus . <PARA> ( papilloma viruses , long thought to result in only benign contagions like warts , have recently been implicated in a dozen or so serious diseases , including genital warts , and cancers of the stomach , cervix , bladder , throat , mouth , stomach , <MASK> , and skin . their function — what causes or triggers them — is not yet understood .) <PARA> we enlightened folk of contemporary times no longer puzzle over the sudden appearance of warts on an otherwise healthy individual , nor do we correlate their disappearance with arcane procedures endured by the afflicted . yet to our forefathers , warts were a huge mystery : they appeared out of nowhere and went back whence they came for no discernable reason . consequently , they developed lore to explain where the warts had come from and rituals to rid the afflicted of them . <PARA> because in those long - ago days no one knew about viruses , folk beliefs sprang up to explain the sudden appearance of warts on the healthy . a child who had developed one of these growths on his hands was said to have handled a toad , with the toad passing one of its bumps to the unsuspecting youngster . alternatively , he was said to have washed his hands in water that had been used to boil eggs . <PARA> yet if folks were mildly curious about where warts came from , they were obsessed with getting rid of them , spawning numerous rituals and curious customs that were supposed to effect wart cures . one school of thought held that rubbing a wart with a bean pod <PARA> and then in great secrecy burying the pod would rid one of the beasties — as the pod rotted away in the ground , so was the wart to subside . another belief dictated the same <MORE> rubbed with chickpeas , pebbles , or grains of wheat which were then tied up in small bundles and transported to crossroads . the contaminated items were then flung in any direction , with the person doing the pitching taking care not to see where they landed , the idea being that whoever picked up these items would have the warts transferred to him . <PARA> washing away warts involved bathing them with liquids held to have special properties , such as water collected from a depression in a stump , holy water , or the blood of animals like eels , cats , pigs , and moles . they could also be spit upon every morning . <PARA> yet that wasn ’ t the end of it . warts could be encircled with a horse hair or a silk thread . or they could be blown upon nine times in the light of a full moon . or the one with the warts could make faces in a mirror at the stroke of midnight for three nights in a row . <PARA> each of these superstitions had its adherents . because warts disappeared as mysteriously as they arrived , their departure often coincided with “ cures ” that had been attempted . before viruses were understood to cause such growths , it made sense to ascribe a wart ’ s defeat to whatever insanity had recently been performed , even if it did involve buried meat or decapitated eels . <PARA> we of more modern times have set our eels behind us and rely upon time to take care of most warts . for those persistent ones the fluttering pages of the calendar fail to off , we look to a variety of surgical and medicinal methods to rid ourselves of them . scraping , freezing , electrocauterization , and co2 laser are effective against the growths , with laser removal both the most precise method and possibly the one most associated with a lower recurrence rate than other methods . those looking for a low - tech and effective method might try occluding the wart with duct tape . as crazy as this method sounds , it has been shown to work in a surprising number of cases . mind you , a 2007 study into the same thing cast doubt on those findings — it found duct tape to have helped with the wart situation in only 21 % of the cases it studied , a result that put it on par with covering such lesions with conventional “ moleskin ,” a cottony bandage that has been around for dog ’ s years . however , transparent duct tape was used in that second test of its effectiveness , rather than the gray - backed rubbery sort used in the 2002 study , a difference which might account for the opposing results . <PARA> barbara “ still beats rubbing them with a frog , though ” mikkelson",2009-09-26T21:09:50+00:00,train_6643,train,misinfo

1,"man ’ s fascination with the concept of longevity beyond the 70 or 80 years of the typical human lifespan is documented in a variety of writings , myths and legends stretching back thousands of years . the ancient greek historian herodotus , for example , wrote of a magical fountain in modern day ethiopia that restored the youth of those who bathed in its waters , and old testament reckonings of the biblical patriarch methuselah ( grandfather of noah ) put his age at the time of his death at between 720 and 969 years . nonetheless , modern reality pales in comparison to such accounts , as the longest verified human lifespan in recorded <MASK> is that of jeanne louise calment , who passed away in her native france in 1997 at the age of 122 . <PARA> one of the more unusual cases of asserted human longevity in modern times involved chinese resident li ching - yuen ( also rendered as li ching - yun ), mention of whom started appearing in u . s . newspaper accounts in the 1920s accompanied by <MASK> that he had been born in either 1677 or 1736 . when li ching - yuen finally died in 1933 , at a reputed age of either 197 or 256 , the new york times noted of his passing that : <PARA> at this remove it ’ s unlikely anyone will ever know exactly old li ching - yuen was at the time of his death — he may have been remarkably old , possibly even older than the longest confirmed human lifespan of 122 years . however , it ’ s highly improbable that he managed to exceed that milestone by as much as 61 % to 110 %, as <MASK> in 20th century accounts of his passing . skeptics believe that any documentation or personal reminiscences supporting li ching - yuen ’ s <MASK> to extraordinary longevity , even if they were genuine , were most likely attributable to his having assumed the identity of a much older ancestor or someone else of similar name .",2013-02-28T08:00:00+00:00,train_5871,train,misinfo

1,"in 1950 , a new york city police officer who was working missing - persons cases examined the body of an approximately 30 - year - old man that was brought into the morgue . the man had shown up in the middle of times square at 11 : 15 p . m . that evening , “ gawking and looking around at the cars and up at the signs like he ’ d never seen them before ,” then was quickly hit and killed by cab when he tried to cross a street against the traffic lights . <PARA> the pockets of the deceased ’ s clothing held multiple pieces of coinage and currency of forms that had not been produced for several decades , yet many of them were in mint condition . his possessions also included items from types of businesses that no longer existed in new york city ( i . e ., a bill from a livery stable and a brass slug from a saloon ), a letter postmarked in 1876 , and cards bearing the name rudolph fentz with an address on fifth avenue . <PARA> further investigations turned up no listings for a “ rudolph fentz ” in new york city phone directories ; the fifth avenue address listed on the dead man ’ s cards had been a business rather than a residence for many years , and no one there had heard of rudolph fentz ; the deceased ’ s fingerprints matched none on file ; and no current missing - persons reports or inquiries fit the details of the body in the morgue . moreover , the dead man ’ s clothes appeared to be about 75 years out of date in style , his apparel bore tags with the name and address of a tailor whom no one had ever heard of , and his hat bore a tag from a store that had gone out of business many years earlier . <PARA> the investigating officer finally turned up a listing in an old phone directory for a “ rudolph fentz , jr .,” a man in his sixties who had passed away five years earlier . his widow had since moved to florida , but by mail she supplied the information that her husband ’ s father , rudolph fentz , had disappeared sometime in the 1870s , having gone out for a walk around 10 : 00 p . m . one evening and never returned . a search of the missing - persons file for 1876 turned up a report for a “ rudolph fentz ,” whose clothing and address corresponded to those of the man killed in times square in 1950 . <PARA> this ostensible report from nypd capt . hubert v . rihm about the unexplained disappearance — and inexplicable reappearance 74 years later — of what appeared to be rudolph fentz has been reproduced in various forms since the 1970s as one of the many tales that seemingly confirms the existence of time travel . yet it is not a <MASK> account at all , but rather an excerpt from a short <MASK> titled “ i ’ m scared ,” which was penned by science fiction writer jack finney ( whose best known work was the novel “ the body snatchers ”) and published in collier ’ s magazine in 1951 . <PARA> in that <MASK> , the narrator is puzzled when he catches a broadcast of a radio program that had gone off the air several years earlier . he then tracks a series of unusual events that are indicative of temporal disturbances : a man received a telephone call from his sister that she insisted she hadn ’ t made until three days later ; a bank discovered that a check had been deposited the day before it was written ; a letter mailed from wyoming was delivered to a new york city address just seventeen minutes later ; and a man was shot and killed by a gun that police had found and impounded the previous day . the narrative involving capt . rihm and the reappearance of fentz was the longest and most detailed vignette offered in “ i ’ m scared ” as <MASK> of the narrator ’ s discovery of rifts in time occurring all around new york city . <PARA> the cause of those temporal disturbances — and the message of “ i ’ m scared ” — was explicated in the <MASK> ’ s closing paragraphs :",2019-11-08 03:25:00+00:00,test_643,test,misinfo

( a contemporary account confirms that crewmen shouted “ huzzah ! her sides are made of iron !” after one enemy shot bounced off a plank and fell into the water , but many more broke through the hull and inflicted damage , according to the same source .) <PARA> another cherished anecdote chronicles a six - month voyage during which , supposedly , the officers and crew of the uss constitution single - handedly consumed more than 252 , 000 gallons of liquor ( roughly three gallons a day per sailor ), and not a single drop of water . some of the details of the <MASK> vary from teller to teller , but the punchline is always the same . <PARA> here , for example , is a version imparted in a speech by then - u . s . secretary of the navy john h . dalton in 1997 : <PARA> you are permitted to scoff . despite their age - old reputation for heroic drinking , no seamen ( or any other humans ) could have guzzled that much booze and lived . not counting the rum confiscated from british ships ( an unknown quantity ), the volume of liquor allegedly consumed in six months by the constitution ’ s crew of 475 totaled 252 , 700 gallons , or 2 . 94 gallons per individual per day . assuming one remained conscious long enough to consume that much in a 24 - hour period ( which is doubtful ), one would not likely survive the experience , much less repeat it day after day , week after week , for six months . the human body can only tolerate so much alcohol . <PARA> to be sure , the constitution would have sailed with a sizable store of rum on board . like their british counterparts , american seamen received a daily ration of “ grog ” ( rum , or sometimes whiskey , mixed with water ), which had been settled upon in the mid - 1700s as the most practical alternative to plain water ( which tended to spoil on long voyages , mainly due to impurities in the wooden casks in which it was stored ), beer and wine ( also prone to spoilage ), or straight rum ( prone to causing behavioral issues ). however , the grog wasn ’ t dispensed willy - nilly , but rather in carefully measured increments prescribed by law , as the uss constitution museum explains : <PARA> so , although the ship would have been stocked with rum , the amount would have been only a fraction of the 79 , 400 gallons <MASK> . an actual list of supplies loaded aboard the constitution prior to a 1799 voyage , for example , included 37 , 500 gallons of water ( similar to the amount <MASK> in the <MASK> ), but only 3 , 000 gallons of rum . if that was insufficient to last the voyage , it wasn ’ t unheard of ( though it was unpopular ) to cut grog rations as necessary . <PARA> none of which is meant to suggest that the quantity of rum is the only credibility issue to be found in this <MASK> , which , in fact , is rife with historical inaccuracies . <PARA> for one , given the multiplicity of variants in circulation , the <MASK> has been set in at least three different time periods . the version relayed by dalton <MASK> it took place during the war of 1812 ; another says the voyage commenced in 1798 ; yet another , relayed by national park service curator harold peterson and <MASK> in the book oceanographic ships , fore and aft , stipulates the date of departure as 23 august 1779 : <PARA> here ’ s why this version doesn ’ t hold water : the uss constitution couldn ’ t have sailed in 1779 ( during the revolutionary war ), given that they weren ’ t finished building it until 1797 . <PARA> it could have sailed ( and , in fact , did sail ) in 1798 , but its mission would not have been “ to destroy and harass english shipping ,” given that the u . s . and britain were not at war . what we do know about the constitution ’ s 1798 voyage is summarized thus by the uss constitution museum : <PARA> the constitution saw plenty of action during the war of 1812 ( 1812 - 1815 ), of course , but the timeline of its actual exploits during that period doesn ’ t match up with any of the events in the <MASK> . <PARA> we therefore share the conclusion of the uss constitution museum ( and others ), to wit that the fabled rum - soaked voyage of the constitution never took place . the <MASK> was fabricated , unquestionably , though we can ’ t say with any certainty by whom , or precisely when . it does appear to be of fairly recent <MASK> , however . the museum notes that the earliest variant discovered by its researchers is peterson ’ s version , ( though they also note that peterson was a careful scholar and unlikely to have invented the <MASK> himself ). the earliest variant we ’ ve found besides peterson ’ s dates from 1959 , having appeared in volume 74 , page 112 of the reader ’ s digest that year .",2017-03-23T22:52:00+00:00,train_6649,train,misinfo

if we can do this , we have a real chance at getting these rino senators to act on the illegitimate and corrupt election presided over by a democrat party that is invested in the communist takeover of our great nation . ” <PARA> the site says it was funded by the political group “ committee for american sovereignty ,” which according to news reports was created in 2016 to help republican operatives — including trump ’ s longtime political confidant roger stone — undermine hillary clinton ’ s presidential campaign by spewing an unfounded conspiracy theory that bill clinton had an illegitimate biracial son . <PARA> the daily beast , however , reported that paul jensen , an attorney for the committee , refuted its connection to the website , and alleged its “ goal is to elect the democrat candidate , suggesting that a democrat - leaning entity , not the committee for american sovereignty , is behind it .” <PARA> on nov . 23 , donald trump jr . refuted the messages urging trump supporters to abstain from voting for loeffler and perdue . <PARA> more than a week later , as trump prepared for a dec . 5 visit to georgia to campaign alongside perdue and loeffler , the president echoed that sentiment , saying in a tweet “ we must work hard ” to ensure victories for the republican senate candidates . <PARA> in sum , the outcome of the runoffs remained unknown ; therefore , it was unclear how any ballots , much less those with invalid markings for trump , would impact results . <PARA> but if , instead of voting for loeffler or perdue , a significant number of republican voters unofficially wrote trump ’ s name on their ballots — and , as a result , election officials had to throw out those ballots — democrats ’ vote margins would benefit . depending on the level of participation in that protest , it could undermine senate republicans ’ chance at securing the chamber ’ s majority . <PARA> nonetheless , <MASK> and federal laws governing elections would not allow voters the opportunity to elect trump to the senate in the runoffs . for those reasons , we rate this <MASK> “ mostly <MASK> .”",2020-12-02 21:42:56+00:00,test_1031,test,misinfo

0,"<MASK> : few beverages have been as successful as gatorade , a carbohydrate - electrolyte sports drink favored by athletes performing at all levels of endeavor — from weekend warriors and sometimes - exercisers right up to professional players and olympic hopefuls . from its humble beginnings almost four decades ago , gatorade has grown to command 80 to 90 percent of north america ’ s sports drink market . <PARA> gatorade was formulated in 1965 by researchers at the university of florida in an effort to help the then - struggling florida gators football team . <PARA> dehydration was taking its toll on the players , who were fated to contest their home games in the heat and humidity of the florida swamp . the new beverage helped counteract the debilitating dehydration far better than pure water had , turning the gators into an effective second - half team . fueled by gatorade , in 1967 the gators won their first orange bowl . <PARA> other athletes who tried the drink soon swore by it , <MASK> it helped them go longer and finish stronger . but it was the kansas city chiefs of the late 1960s who brought what had previously been a little - known sports beverage to national prominence . like the gators , chiefs players were struggling with the effects of heat and humidity , albeit in missouri . ray graves , coach of the gators , told hank stram , the chiefs ’ coach , about the dramatic results his players were experiencing thanks to the invigorating concoction . a few cases of gatorade were shipped to the chiefs to try , and the same dramatic improvements in energy levels and performance were noted in their players . the chiefs made gatorade a part of their lives , winning the 1969 - 1970 championship with a 23 - 7 victory over the minnesota vikings in super bowl iv with gatorade at their <PARA> side . <PARA> gatorade came to be commercially produced after one of its developers at university of florida moved to indiana in 1967 , where he met a vice - president for stokely - van camp , a national company which produces canned and frozen fruits and vegetables . stokely - van camp secured the rights to gatorade from the university of florida and its researchers , and began marketing the drink nationwide . in 1983 quaker oats bought out stokely - van camp , and gatorade became a member of the pepsico family when quaker oats merged with the beverage giant in 2001 . <PARA> the success of the drink has brought fame but also fortune to university of florida . gatorade has fetched more than $ 80 million in royalties for the school since 1973 , when a series of legal disputes resulted in the creation of the gatorade trust for the benefit of the <MASK> inventors and the school . these monies have made numerous research projects possible in a wide array of disciplines . <PARA> the drink itself has changed little since its invention . it is still a combination of carbohydrates ( sucrose , glucose , and fructose ) and electrolytes ( potassium and sodium ). the first batch brewed by those long ago scientists is reported to have been rather nasty , but the addition of lemon juice made it drinkable . today ’ s gatorade is a sweet - tasting drink . <PARA> gatorade has since become an integral part of a number of sports , even beyond its use as a potable . coaches of winning football teams are routinely doused with barrels of it at the conclusion of games , with the baptism by gatorade having become almost a ritual . <PARA> barbara “ is it in you ?” mikkelson",2011-06-07T02:33:56+00:00,train_5467,train,info
1,"<MASK> : all too often an in - joke or obvious tongue - in - cheek reference is taken by the public as a straight <MASK> ( as we know far too well from the frequent weekly world news <MASK> sent to us for “ verification ”). a notorious example of this phenomenon occurred in 1969 , when a joke review of a non - existent album featuring some of rock ’ s biggest stars was printed in rolling stone magazine and prompted the release of a satirical imitation , which people then mistook for the real thing ! <PARA> the saga began when rock critic greil marcus ( under the pseudonym of “ t . m . christian ”), prompted by a recent rolling stone <MASK> about sales of a double <PARA> bootleg album of unreleased bob dylan material (“ great white wonder ,” often cited as the first bootleg record ) wrote a fictitious review of another “ bootleg ” album entitled “ the masked marauders ” for the 18 october 1969 issue of rolling stone . the name “ masked marauders ” was supposedly a flimsy deception employed by bob dylan , mick jagger , john lennon , paul mccartney , george harrison and others , all of whom had gotten together and recorded a “ supergroup ” album ( allegedly produced by al kooper ) that could not be released under their real names because they were all under contract to different record companies . even though the “ review ” contained plenty of clues to indicate it was nothing more than a bit of humorous fun ( e . g ., the session was said to have been recorded “ in a small town near the site of the <MASK> hudson bay colony in canada ” and featured paul mccartney singing “ mammy ,” mick jagger warbling “ i can ’ t get no nookie ,” and bob dylan imitating donovan ), more than a few readers didn ’ t get the put - on and went looking for the album at their local record stores . <PARA> as demand for the mythical record grew , marcus and fellow rolling stone critic / editor langdon winner took the gag a step further by recruiting a group of berkeley musicians ( since <MASK> to have been the personnel who comprised the cleanliness and godliness skiffle band ) to record a group of songs matching those described in the review ( right down to imitating the voices of the famous singers putatively involved ); the tape received local radio airplay and was eventually bought by warner bros . music , who issued it as an album on their reprise label . ( the lp actually appeared as a deity / reprise record , since the faux review had listed it as a deity release , and a single — i can ’ t get no nookie b / w cow pie — was issued as deity 0870 .) <PARA> even though the record bore no pictures of the “ masked marauders ” ( the cover merely featured a photograph of a woman ) and contained no identifying information about them on its outer sleeve , it ’ s hard to believe that even those who hadn ’ t read the review could have been taken in by the hoax . mick jagger complaining “ i can ’ t get no nookie ”? bob dylan warbling the 50 ’ s doo - wop classic “ duke of earl ” and donovan ’ s “ season of the witch ”? <PARA> buyers who still didn ’ t get it should have been clued in by an inner sheet included with the record that clearly spelled out the whole thing was a put - on ( and even if that was missing , the album ’ s closing track all but screamed “ this is a joke ”). nonetheless , fans avidly sought out the record , and people <PARA> swore they recognized jagger ’ s voice or mccartney ’ s bass playing and couldn ’ t possibly be mistaken . <PARA> mistaken they were , and eventually rolling stone itself exposed the whole thing . that the public ’ s gullibility knew no bounds was demonstrated all over again several years later , when the 1976 debut album by a group of canadian studio players called klaatu , which similarly lacked any photographs or information about the group itself , was widely <MASK> to have been a new beatles album . <PARA> an odd postscript to this <MASK> would be to note that in 1988 , george harrison formed a marauders - like band named the traveling wilburys with bob dylan , tom petty , roy orbison , and jeff lynne , all of whom were identified with pseudonyms using the surname ‘ wilbury ’ on the album sleeve . <PARA> additional information : hear a bit of the marauders and their mick jagger sound - alike performing “ i can ’ t get no nookie ”:",2010-01-11T16:50:18+00:00,train_1724,train,misinfo

citizen caught voting must be deported : <PARA> the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of 1996 ( iirira ) did contain two provisions specifically addressing voting by non - citizens (“ aliens ”). the first made it a federal crime for non - citizens to vote in elections involving candidates for national office . the second <MASK> that any non - citizen who voted in violation of any federal , <MASK> , or local law was both “ excludable ” and “ deportable .” both of the <MASK> enacted in the legislation were revised and clarified over time but have not been repealed . <PARA> in its current form , 18 u . s . code section 611 declares it unlawful for aliens to vote in federal elections , with certain carefully demarcated exceptions : <PARA> apart from this <MASK> , federal law doesn ’ t expressly prohibit non - citizens from voting , though the laws of all 50 individual <MASK> do ( which has been the case since 1926 ). thus , with the exception of a very few municipalities in certain <MASK> where local ordinances allow non - citizens to vote in school board elections or on other local matters , it is illegal for non - citizens to vote in the united <MASK> . <PARA> for someone convicted of violating the federal prohibition on non - citizens voting in national elections , section 611 imposes a fine and / or imprisonment of up to one year . however , it does not address the subject of deportation , which is covered under another u . s . <MASK> and applies to aliens who violate <MASK> and local voting regulations as well as federal ones . <PARA> 8 u . s . code section 1227 (“ deportable aliens ”) lists the classes of non - citizens present in the united <MASK> who “ shall , upon the order of the attorney general , be removed .” unlawful voting is covered in subsection 6 : <PARA> practically speaking , “ deportable ” in this instance doesn ’ t mean precisely the same thing as “ must be deported .” non - citizens found guilty of so - called “ aggravated felonies ” ( such as murder , sex crimes , drug trafficking , etc .) are subject to automatic , mandatory removal from the country , but non - citizens convicted solely of unlawful voting ( unless they falsified citizenship documents for that purpose , which could result in an aggravated felony charge ) are entitled to a hearing before an immigration judge if deportation proceedings are initiated against them . the judge must rule , based on the <MASK> and consideration of the non - citizen ’ s application for relief or protection from removal ( if any ), whether to proceed with deportation . <PARA> that said , the permissible exceptions ( as cited in the <MASK> above ) are quite narrow . the only conditions under which it is not a deportable crime for a non - citizen to vote are when the act occurred in a local election where permitted by local law , or when the non - citizen is the child of u . s . citizens , has been a legal permanent resident since before the age of 16 , and reasonably believed at the time of the violation that they possessed citizenship . the latter exception aside , recent cases have demonstrated that neither the reasonable belief that one was a citizen at the time one voted nor unawareness that it is illegal to vote as a non - citizen is likely to spare someone convicted of the crime from deportation . <PARA> so , while deportation is neither automatic nor a certainty in unlawful voting cases involving non - citizens , it is by law a deportable offense , and the most likely outcome if proceedings are initiated by the government is removal from the country . “ illegal voting makes a person ineligible for citizenship , may cause them to lose their green card if they have one , and can put them into deportation proceedings where they may not have any ability to get relief from being ordered removed ,” william a . stock , the national president of the american immigration lawyers association , told us . “ it puts any non -

1,"<MASK> : this helpful heads - up about restaurant condiments began appearing in our inbox in early october 2004 . <PARA> although the account lacks specifics which could be researched and disproved ( the perpetrator was identified solely as “ a man ,” the eatery where the adulterated ketchup dispenser was discovered was “ a fast food outlet ( to remain unnamed ),” and the incident happened “ within the last month ”), it should nonetheless be dismissed as poppycock . <PARA> we have failed to find any news accounts about such a tampering , in the u . s . or elsewhere . had such an incident occurred , it would have been picked up by at least a few news outlets . <PARA> the centers for disease control emphatically says people cannot acquire hiv via restaurant food : <PARA> no incident of food being contaminated with hiv - infected blood or semen has been reported to cdc . furthermore , cdc has received no reports of hiv infection resulting from eating food , including condiments . <PARA> hiv does not live long outside the body . even if small amounts of hiv - infected blood or semen was consumed , exposure to the air , heat from cooking , and stomach acid would destroy the virus . therefore , there is no risk of contracting hiv from eating food . <PARA> hiv does not live long outside the body . even if small amounts of hiv - infected blood or semen was consumed , exposure to the air , heat from cooking , and stomach acid would destroy the virus . therefore , there is no risk of contracting hiv from eating food . <PARA> since its 2004 <MASK> , the hoax has continued to circulate in e - mail , even on some occasions being forwarded by senders one would assume were credible . in 2006 , a staff member of the alabama attorney general ’ s office forwarded it to her acquaintances . the inclusion of her signature , which identified her as being with that office , added credence to the <MASK> tale . <PARA> in 2007 , an employee with the department of health and human services in arkansas causes similar concern by forwarding the e - mail from her work account , a process that appended the name , phone number , fax number , and e - mail address of that agency to the <PARA> hoax . <PARA> as for the potential for harm were someone to attempt such a contamination , it ’ s non - existent . the hiv virus does not long survive outside its host medium of human bodily fluids : blood , semen , vaginal fluid , breast milk , saliva , tears . ( which is not to say hiv can be transmitted by every one of those — according to the centers for disease control ( aka the cdc ), “ contact with saliva , tears , or sweat has never been shown to result in transmission of hiv .”) the cdc says except under laboratory conditions , hiv is unable to reproduce outside its living host — it therefore , does not spread or maintain infectiousness outside its host . therefore , were hiv - tainted blood to be mixed into a condiments vat , the virus would neither survive nor while it was still viable multiply and so replenish itself . <PARA> while it is tempting to rule out the adulterated ketchup tale on the basis of folks ’ failure to acquire the virus through oral contact with or swallowing of hiv - laden bodily fluids , the cdc confirms there have been infections through oral transmission . though infection by this route is far less likely , it does happen . however , whatever oral transmission infections there have been , none have so far come from contact with or ingestion of a food product or beverage — all have been through sexual contact . <PARA> the folkloric element of blood being secreted in brownish or reddish foodstuffs is common to other legends , including the belief that rather than discard bloody cows ’ milk dairies use it in chocolate milk and that the popular beverage jägermeister contains deer or elk blood . <PARA> the urban legend canon is rife with tales about innocent parties catching aids through casual and unsuspecting contact with harmless items or through the conduct of uninjurious activities ( hiv - laden needles affixed to gas pump handles , or left in the coin returns of payphones , or used to booby - trap seats in movie theatres , or hiv - infected semen secreted in pizza or other fast foods , for example ). such lore ’ s popularity grows out of our fear of contracting the aids virus . even if we take pains to avoid engaging in high risk activities or strive to do so in as safe a fashion as possible , we ’ re all too aware we ’ re still vulnerable , and these legends speak to that awareness . though in the early days of this disease , the average citizen felt perfectly safe from its ravages , aids is no longer perceived as something that only other people will catch . it ’ s now seen as a danger to all of us . <PARA> this sense of being at risk , coupled with ongoing fears of the madmen who walk among us , has given birth to this form of scarelore . today it ’ s ketchup ; tomorrow it will be something else . <PARA> barbara “ devil take the heinzmost ” mikkelson",2004-10-07T07:59:02+00:00,train_464,train,misinfo

1,"several now - viral videos posted to twitter , facebook , and tiktok in may 2020 showed small insects crawling along the outside of strawberries after the fruit had been soaked in a saltwater solution . collectively , the videos received hundreds of thousands of views and sparked many questions about the methodology . <PARA> social media users filled a bowl with water and table salt . once the salt had dissolved , strawberries were said to have been submerged in the solution for “ about 30 minutes ” after which point small “ worms ” could be seen crawling around the outside of the berry . <PARA> though it is <MASK> that strawberries and other fruit may house small insects and the saltwater method is largely used by the agricultural industry as a way to detect such <MASK> , entomological experts at oregon <MASK> university told snopes that there is no scientific <MASK> that suggests a saltwater solution can , in fact , force pests out from infested berries . <PARA> the insect in question is an invasive flying pest called spotted wing drosophila ( swd ), or drosophila suzukii . endemic to asia , swd was first detected in north america in california in 2008 and has since spread to many regions of the united <MASK> where the insects are known to infect fruit crops and berries , according to michigan <MASK> university ( msu ). female flies lay their eggs in fruit where they will ultimately hatch into a delectable habitat prime for larval feeding . if the pest is not controlled through mitigation measures , msu adds that it is possible fruit may be harvested with larvae inside . <PARA> despite a lack of published scientific <MASK> , the saltwater method is one most often employed by commercial growers in order to determine whether an swd <MASK> has occurred , but berry lovers of any sort can also use it to detect creepy crawlies . <PARA> “ a backyard gardener can easily open up a suspect fruit and see 3 - to 5 - millimeter whitish larvae with the naked eye . larvae will move when exposed to light ,” notes a guide published by oregon <MASK> university ( osu ). “ alternatively , a handful of fruit can be placed in a plastic bag , crushed , mixed with either a salt or vinegar solution , and then closely examined for larvae .” <PARA> to do so , a salt or brown sugar solution should be prepared at least 24 hours before use to ensure that the salt or sugar dissolves entirely . add to 1 gallon of water a full cup of salt , or 2 . 5 cups of light brown sugar , and shake well — a well - dissolved solution increases the chance of larvae floating to the surface of the solution . fruit should be crushed and fully submerged in the solution , which will prompt larvae to exit , float to the surface and eventually drown . either sugar or salt will work , but the former will keep larvae alive longer and allow for a longer period of time to see movement . <PARA> although the saltwater method is used to detect pest <MASK> , experts note that it is largely unnecessary as commercial growers conduct rigorous testing to determine whether swd larvae are present before the fruit is accepted by stores . in fact , most fruit is known to contain small insects otherwise undetected by the human eye . [ as in the case of some of the circulated videos , some pests found on strawberries were not swd but likely small insects that live on the outside of the fruit .] <PARA> “ such washing with salt would not be necessary under [ sic ] these circumstances . strawberries are also quite porous , and i would not want to eat fruit that was soaked or washed in salty water ,” said bernadine strik , a berry crops expert with the osu extension service . <PARA> testing fruit for insects is different than washing it , adds strik . according to the centers for disease control and prevention , water alone should suffice . if swd - infested berries are ingested , they are unlikely to do any harm . iowa <MASK> university extension and outreach notes that infested fruit is safe to eat , and ingestion poses no known risk to human health .",2020-07-10 16:38:03+00:00,test_267,test,misinfo

0,"in february 2020 , after former film producer harvey weinstein was convicted of raping one woman and sexually assaulting another , an old video re - emerged online which appeared to show former first lady michelle obama praising weinstein as “ a wonderful human being .” <PARA> obama ’ s remarks , and a short accompanying video clip , were promulgated chiefly by right - leaning , pro - trump twitter accounts , as shown below . the footage shows her describing weinstein as “ a wonderful human being ” and “ a good friend .” <PARA> michelle obama did indeed once describe weinstein as a “ wonderful human being .” the footage and remarks included in those social media posts were authentic and unedited . however , many posts did not include an important piece of context — obama made those remarks in 2013 , four years before dozens of women first publicly accused weinstein of rape , sexual assault , sexual harassment , and various other sexual improprieties . as a result , her praise of weinstein should not be interpreted as an endorsement of his offenses . <PARA> the former first lady was speaking in the east room of the white house on nov . 8 , 2013 , at a student film symposium . towards the beginning of her speech , she emphatically thanked weinstein for his role in “ organizing ” the event : <PARA> “ i want to start by thanking harvey weinstein for organizing this amazing day . [ audience applauds ]. harvey . this is possible because of harvey . he is a wonderful human being , a good friend , and just a powerhouse . and the fact that he and his team took the time to make this happen for all of you should say something , not about me or about this place , but about you [ points to audience ]. we are here because of you .” <PARA> weinstein himself was present at the event , seated behind obama while she spoke : <PARA> the official transcript of obama ’ s full remarks can be read here . the obama white house website described the event as providing high school students from washington d . c ., boston , and new york “ an opportunity to learn about animation , special effects , makeup , costume , directing , music and sound effects , and heard from leaders in the film industry about how their education helped them succeed .” <PARA> participants in the event included whoopi goldberg , blake lively , naomie harris , and “ cbs this morning ” host gayle king . <PARA> before beginning her college education at harvard university in the fall of 2017 , the obamas ’ eldest daughter malia worked as an intern for the weinstein company , according to news reports and court records . that was before october 2017 , when dozens of women first began to come forward to publicly accuse the influential producer of a range of sexual offenses across several decades , including rape , sexual assault , and sexual harassment . <PARA> although weinstein ’ s behavior had been the subject of <MASK> and speculation within the film industry for several years , it seems unlikely that the obamas had full knowledge of the allegations against him , given malia ’ s work placement just months before those stories first broke publicly . in light of michelle obama ’ s glowing tribute to weinstein in november 2013 , it seems equally unlikely that she was aware of his offenses at that time . we contacted the office of barack and michelle obama , asking when the former first lady first became aware of those allegations , but we did not receive a response in time for publication .",2020-02-27 20:21:08+00:00,test_1060,test,info
1,"<MASK> : public awareness of what we now term <PARA> “ subliminal advertising ” began with the 1957 publication of vance packard ’ s book , the hidden persuaders . although packard did not use the term “ subliminal advertising ,” he did describe many of the new “ motivational research ” marketing techniques being employed to sell products in the burgeoning post - war american market . advertisements that focused on consumers ’ hopes , fears , guilt , and sexuality were designed to persuade them to buy products they ’ d never realized they needed . marketers who could reach into the hearts and minds of american consumers soon found consumers ’ wallets to be within easy grasp as well . <PARA> it was james vicary who coined the term “ subliminal advertising .” vicary had conducted a variety of unusual studies of female shopping habits , discovering ( among other things ) that women ’ s eye - blink rates dropped significantly in supermarkets , that “ psychological spring ” lasts more than twice as long as “ psychological winter ,” and that “ the experience of a woman baking a cake could be likened to a woman giving birth .” vicary ’ s studies were largely forgettable , save for one experiment he conducted at a ft . lee , new jersey movie theater during the summer of 1957 . vicary placed a tachistoscope in the theater ’ s projection booth , and all throughout the playing of the film picnic , he flashed a couple of different messages on the screen every five seconds . the messages each displayed for only 1 / 3000th of a second at a time , far below the viewers ’ threshold of conscious perceptibility . the result of displaying these imperceptible suggestions — “ drink coca - cola ” and “ hungry ? eat popcorn ” — was an amazing 18 . 1 % increase in coca - cola sales , and a whopping 57 . 8 % jump in popcorn purchases . thus was demonstrated the awesome power of “ subliminal advertising ” to coerce unwary buyers into making purchases they would not otherwise have <PARA> considered . <PARA> or so goes the legend that has retained its potency for more than forty years , which includes the belief the federal communications commission banned “ subliminal advertising ” from radio and television airwaves in 1974 , despite that fact that no studies had shown it to be effective , and even though its alleged efficacy was based on a fraud . <PARA> you see , vicary lied about the results of his experiment . when he was challenged to repeat the test by the president of the psychological corporation , dr . henry link , vicary ’ s duplication of his <MASK> experiment produced no significant increase in popcorn or coca - cola sales . eventually vicary confessed that he had falsified the data from his first experiments , and some critics have since expressed doubts that he actually conducted his infamous ft . lee experiment at all . <PARA> as usual , the media ( and thereby the public ) paid attention only to the sensational <MASK> <MASK> , and the scant coverage given to vicary ’ s later confession was ignored or quickly forgotten . radio and television <MASK> began airing subliminal commercials , leading to two congressional bills to ban the practice being introduced in 1958 and 1959 ( both of which died before being voted upon ). in 1973 , dr . wilson b . key picked up where vicary left off , publishing subliminal seduction , an indictment of modern advertisements filled with hidden messages and secret symbols — messages and symbols that only dr . key could discern ( including the notorious example of the word “ s - e - x ” spelled out in the ice cubes pictured in a liquor advertisement ). the old “ subliminal advertising ” controversy was stirred up again by dr . key ’ s book , leading to the 24 january 1974 announcement by the fcc that subliminal techniques , “ whether effective or not ,” were “ contrary to the public interest ,” and that any <MASK> employing them risked losing its broadcast license . <PARA> for neither the first nor the last time , a great deal of time and money and effort was expended on “ protecting ” the public from something that posed no danger to them . as numerous studies over the last few decades have demonstrated , subliminal advertising doesn ’ t work ; in fact , it never worked , and the whole premise was based on a lie from the very beginning . james vicary ’ s legacy was to ensure that a great many people will never be convinced otherwise , however . <PARA> sightings : the “ subliminal cut spurs popcorn sales ” is explicitly mentioned in a 1973 columbo movie (“ double exposure “), and the acceptance of its principle as fact forms the basis of the episode .",2011-05-05T04:30:56+00:00,train_907,train,misinfo

( our definition of pedophile is an adult who sexually preys on children ).” <PARA> he also stood by the <MASK> that the bill would “ protect pedophiles who rape children ,” citing california ’ s age - of - consent law as a reason to ignore the distinction between forcible rape and “ consensual ” sex acts such as those that fall under the heading of <MASK> rape : <PARA> in march 2019 , wiener ’ s office issued an amended version of sb - 145 to clarify its intent and allay public confusion about which types of offenses were and were not included in the bill . after the bill finally became law in september 2020 , its provisions were once again widely misrepresented and assailed as “ pro - pedophilia .” wiener called these <MASK> “ grossly disingenuous .”",2019-03-01T01:08:52+00:00,train_670,train,misinfo

0,"in september and october 2019 , we received multiple inquiries from readers about the veracity of reports that <MASK> u . s . sen . elizabeth warren had said or argued to the effect that “ taxpayers must fund sex reassignment surgery .” <PARA> on aug . 14 , the right - leaning website onenewsnow published an <MASK> with the headline , “ warren : taxpayers must fund sex reassignment surgery ,” which reported that : <PARA> warren ’ s tweet included a link to the website protect trans health , a campaign run by the transgender law center and the national center for transgender equality . the purpose of that campaign was to solicit and convey criticism to the u . s . department of health and human services ( hhs ) about its controversial move to repeal an obama - era rule that prohibits healthcare and insurance providers from discriminating against trans individuals . <PARA> so the source cited by onenewsnow did not involve warren saying , “ taxpayers must fund sex reassignment surgery .” the phrasing of the website ’ s headline may have given some readers the impression it was a direct <MASK> , even though onenewsnow did not actually use <MASK> marks . it might also have led some to believe warren had proposed that all sex - reassignment surgeries must be taxpayer - funded , which is not the case . <PARA> nonetheless , an examination of the record , and confirmation from warren ’ s 2020 presidential campaign , make it clear that she does indeed support covering sex - reassignment surgery under taxpayer - funded programs like medicaid , as well as full legal access to the surgery , under private health insurance and obamacare . <PARA> we asked the warren campaign whether she supports gender - reassignment surgery , and other transition - related services such as medication , being made available at low cost or no cost , under taxpayer - funded programs such as medicare , medicaid , tricare ( for military service members and veterans ), as well as through obamacare and private health insurance policies . a campaign spokesperson was unequivocal in response : “ yes .” <PARA> the campaign also directed us to a september 2019 interview warren conducted with “ hiv plus ” magazine , in which she gave further details about her stance on the issue . the interview refers to section 1557 of the affordable care act ( obamacare ), so a brief explanation is warranted . <PARA> section 1557 incorporated existing anti - discrimination law into the affordable care act ( aca ). it prohibited healthcare or insurance providers that receive federal funding ( include <MASK> - by - <MASK> medicaid programs ) from discriminating against patients on the basis of their sex , race , religion , national <MASK> , and so on . <PARA> in 2016 , hhs under president barack obama implemented a new rule that expanded those protections <MORE> identity which it defined as one ’ s internal sense of being ‘ male , female , neither , or a combination of male and female .’ in response to a subsequent lawsuit by several <MASK> and healthcare entities , on december 31 , 2016 , a federal court preliminarily enjoined the rule ’ s gender identity and termination of pregnancy provisions on a nationwide basis , finding them contrary to the applicable civil rights law , the religious freedom restoration act , and the administrative procedure act . <PARA> “ a second federal court agreed . because the preliminary injunction continues to be in effect , hhs cannot , and has not since the date of the injunction , enforced the rule ’ s provisions the court said are likely unlawful . the proposed rule would revise the provisions subject to those injunctions to conform with the plain understanding recognized by the court .” <PARA> with that context and background in mind , the following is the most relevant exchange from warren ’ s september 2019 interview with “ hiv plus ” magazine : <PARA> warren ’ s declaration that she would as president “ direct hhs to interpret section 1557 under its 2016 guidance ” means she would enforce , once again , a set of rules that mean sex - reassignment surgery would be covered under federal programs such as medicare , medicaid , and tricare , including <MASK> - by - <MASK> medicaid programs . <PARA> as such , it is accurate to <MASK> that warren does propose and has proposed that taxpayers should cover the cost of some sex - reassignment surgeries , as they do other treatments and services , under those programs . <PARA> warren was also one of 31 u . s . senators who signed on to a june 2019 letter to trump ’ s hhs , which opposed and criticized the proposed reversal of the 2016 anti - discrimination enhancements . warren was joined in signing that latter by fellow presidential candidates and u . s . senators kamala harris , kirsten gillibrand , bernie sanders , amy klobuchar , and cory booker . <PARA> warren has therefore put on the record , several times in 2019 , her support for sex - reassignment surgery being included among the treatments and services covered under taxpayer - funded programs , as well as under obamacare and private health insurance policies . <PARA> however , the onenewsnetwork headline had a tendency to mislead some readers who may have interpreted its phrasing to mean that warren had said , word - for - word , “ taxpayers must fund sex reassignment surgery ,” or that she had advocated taxpayers must fund any and all sex reassignment surgery , rather than simply adding one more procedure to the list of procedures taxpayers already fund under medicaid and similar federal programs . <PARA> as such , we issue a rating of “ mostly <MASK> .”",2019-10-02 16:51:52+00:00,test_500,test,info

( although it was attributed to “ john tabb ,” an earlier version was credited to “ jeffery rightmire .”) <PARA> as is often the case with e - mail polemics focused on purported welfare abuse and taxpayer outrage , the “ new american way of life ” offers an implausible , far -

income families with subsidized vouchers they can use towards paying a portion of their monthly rent . <PARA> while section 8 is frequently derided in the fashion referenced above , it ’ s very difficult to play the system in the manner described due to the low supply versus tremendous demand for housing and vouchers among those in need of it . applicants typically have to spend years on waiting lists before section 8 housing becomes available , and in many cases it takes years to even get one ’ s name on a waiting list in the first place . waiting lists for the program close to new applicants for years at a time on a not - infrequent basis , as a 24 august 2015 <MASK> in the albuquerque journal reported : <PARA> so it ’ s extremely unlikely the baby daddy landlord in this hypothetical scenario could simply make a residence available for the section 8 program and then immediately rent it to the tenant of his choosing . he ’ d typically have to wait years for his preferred renter ( i . e ., his girlfriend ) to get on a section 8 waiting list , then more years for her to work her way to the top of the list , before he could double - dip by getting the government to subsidize his girlfriend ’ s paying him rent to live in a house he owns . the baby daddy in this scenario ( one who can afford to buy his own house ) would probably be far better off financially if he simply lived in the house with his girlfriend , or rented it out to someone other than his girlfriend . <PARA> there is a persistent misperception that the patient protection and affordable care act ( also known as ppaca , the aca <MORE> one of the two children as a dependent , than the mother can ’ t be legally collecting benefits ( such as snap ) for both children . <PARA> for starters , one cannot simply declare herself to be mentally ill or have back problems , then sit back and collect disability payments for the rest of her ( working ) life . such <MASK> have to be documented by medical professionals as genuinely disabling conditions , and even then those living with disabilities find that securing benefits isn ’ t quite so easy . presuming the woman in this anecdote is fairly young , she would have to have accrued sufficient work credits to qualify for lifelong disability payments ( an unlikely scenario ), and then she would still have to meet separate criteria for a qualifying condition ( which precludes having earned more than $ 1 , 090 per month in that year ). the condition under which a person qualifies also must be one that limits ability to do any other work : <PARA> according to data from the agency , more than half of disability <MASK> are denied , and the wait for hearings has increased ( partly due to an aging pool of applicants ). the anecdotal <MASK> ’ s purported plundering of disability benefits also conflicts with her concurrent sponging of educational grants , as the usefulness of the latter is negated by the former : a full - time student wouldn ’ t qualify for lifelong disability payments , and college would be unnecessary for the matriarch of a household who intended to remain home for life collecting benefits for her fabricated disability . <PARA> as the excerpt above concludes , the figures bandied about in the e - mail encompass virtually all programs available to low - income americans and extrapolates the fictional family described routinely accesses all of them . some of the benefits described ( such as free college for single mothers or free utility programs ) don ’ t seem to exist , and several of forms of assistance ( such as section 8 or disability ) are not administered in the simplistic manner suggested by this item . <PARA> furthermore , while this item asserts that the complex welfare hustling plan described here is “ perfectly legal ,” several aspects of it involve defrauding the system in an expressly prohibited ( and largely criminal ) fashion . were any family to hide assets or lie about household income on application forms , they would be subject to severe penalties and prosecution should their perfidy be unraveled . the scheme also rests upon the ( fallacious ) notion that access to assistance programs is easy to both maintain and retain . <PARA> finally , the causes of the national debt are fairly complex . however , social security , medicare / medicaid , and defense broadly account for most government spending . <PARA> <MASK> published : 31 august 2015",2015-09-01T14:55:00+00:00,train_6467,train,misinfo

1,"a popular <MASK> that has been in circulation online since at least 2010 is one that involves long - haired native americans serving as scouts in the vietnam war . the earliest mention of the tale we found was an 8 december 2010 post from the self - described “ indiana jones of the superfoods and longevity universe ,” david ‘ avocado ’ wolfe . <PARA> as the <MASK> goes , a woman married to a veterans affairs medical hospital psychologist caught wind ( via her husband ) of top secret information about how the military recruited scouts on native american reservations for the vietnam war . but once the scouts ’ hair was cut to regulation military length , they lost their preternatural tracking skills . later tests showed that long , flowing hair was an essential component of those skills : <PARA> the author of the tale attempted to explain a possible scientific rationale for such an occurrence : <PARA> this <MASK> presented two separate areas in need of fact - checking : the historical <MASK> that the united <MASK> military recruited native americans as scouts during the vietnam era and later commissioned a study to find out why they were not performing as expected , and the scientific <MASK> that hair functioned as an aid in military scouting activities . <PARA> the historical account given here is dubious at best , and the <MASK> that it stemmed from a “ secret ” project challenges us to prove a negative . logical fallacies notwithstanding , the confirmable facts are that numerous native american soldiers served in vietnam , a large majority of whom volunteered for their service before being drafted and were integrated into regular units , and no historical accounts exist of specialized scouting units composed of long - haired native american soldiers . <PARA> we reached out to the military regarding the possibility that such a program may have occurred , and f . lee reynolds with the united <MASK> army center of military <MASK> provided us with the following <MASK> : <PARA> an actual united <MASK> military project to recruit scouts from a specific ethnic group did exist , but the targeted group was viet cong defectors recruited to serve as intelligence scouts . this setup makes a good deal more sense relative to the native american <MASK> , given the viet cong ’ s actual knowledge of the land and its inhabitants . <PARA> the scientific <MASK> are no less dubious . while it is borderline accurate to say that hair plays a role in the nervous system , that does not mean it serves as some sort of “ antenna ” into the ineffable aspects of our own consciousness . the reality is a bit less grandiose , according to the new england journal of medicine : <PARA> in other words , the two primary functions hair has on a sensory level are to signal physical movement of the hair and to detect pathogens . in both cases , however , it is not the hair itself that is talking to the nervous or immune systems , but the cells of the follicle to which the hair is attached . it is unclear how the subtle movement of one ’ s hair or the ability to detect pathogens via the scalp would have any bearing on scouting in the vietnam war . <PARA> the <MASK> <MASK> on this subject went on to <MASK> that hair both emits and receives electromagnetic signals to and from the brain : <PARA> the notion that hair emits electromagnetic energy is demonstrably <MASK> . hair is a terrible conductor of electricity and is actually comparable in electrical resistivity to rubber , which commonly used to protect against the flow of an electric current . other less well - defined terms such “ intuition ” are harder to refute , but it should be noted that not a single version of this <MASK> provided any sort of mechanism outside of the implausible and vague notion of electromagnetic signals . <PARA> kirlian photography , the only piece of “ <MASK> ” provided for the nebulous <MASK> of hair as an intuition antenna , is a common topic on new age , alternative health , and metaphysical websites . in broad terms , it is a collection of techniques used to photograph an electric field , which new age and alternative health practitioners sometimes describe as an “ aura ” that is medically or spiritually informative . <PARA> science finds no support for such a <MASK> , however . any differences in a before / after photographs of hair would almost certainly represent nothing more than the moisture content of the hair or lack thereof , as later studies into the topic revealed . <PARA> as native american writer and creator of the blog “ native skeptic ” noah nez wrote on a post for the center for inquiry , hair plays an important role in many tribes ’ religious beliefs , but those views have often been co - opted by various new age movements : <PARA> this fanciful tale relies on the unsourced and unverifiable <MASK> from a website that frequently peddles highly shareable stories having little to no scientific legitimacy , and it appears that the tale of long - haired native american scouts in vietnam belongs to that genre . not a single piece of historical <MASK> supports the <MASK> of native american scout recruitment by the u . s . military , and no scientific <MASK> that holds up to any level of scrutiny supports the idea of heightened intuition resulting from longer hair .",2016-12-06T20:59:09+00:00,train_6019,train,misinfo

thirty or so is truly unbelievable . <PARA> the second <MASK> involved a similar measure of street justice purportedly meted out by kyle to what many would deem deserving recipients . in that tale , kyle was nearly the victim of a carjacking at a gas <MASK> , but the deadly sniper was quicker than his would - be assailants : he drew and fatally wounded the unnamed men . <PARA> the <MASK> got odder , though , when police responded to the situation ( in <MORE> inappropriate time : while they were mourning the loss of a fellow seal at a bar : <PARA> yet again , the <MASK> eventually developed another intriguing twist when kyle elaborated upon it during a 2012 appearance on fox news channel ’ s the o ’ reilly factor . during that segment , kyle <MASK> the previously unnamed individual he described was none other than jesse ventura , the former professional wrestler , governor of minnesota , and member of the navy ’ s underwater demolition teams during the vietnam war era . <PARA> while the <MASK> about the aftermath of hurricane katrina and the carjacking incident were met with some general disbelief , the mention of ventura ’ s name introduced a separate credibility issue for kyle in the form of a lawsuit filed by ventura against kyle after the latter ’ s appearance on o ’ reilly ’ s show . after kyle died in 2013 the suit continued against his <MASK> , and a jury eventually found kyle ’ s <MASK> had improperly profited from <MASK> made by the decedent that had no basis in provable fact and awarded ventura $ 1 . 8 million dollars in damages : <PARA> however , it should be noted the jury in the case did not specifically have to determine whether kyle had in fact punched out ventura ( for whatever reason ) in order to find in favor of the plaintiff , and its verdict may not have been unanimous : <PARA> so while chris kyle ’ s historical legacy as one of america ’ s most lethal snipers in foreign wars may be confirmed and corroborated , his <MASK> about various “ take charge ” incidents in the u . s . are lacking in substantiation . no record of any shooting deaths matching the description of kyle ’ s purported carjacking victims has ever surfaced , nor has anyone produced the supposed security camera video of the incident ( or even <MASK> such a video truly exists ). new orleans authorities did not log some thirty unaccounted - for shooting deaths in the wake of hurricane katrina ;

0,"in november 2019 , we received multiple inquiries from readers about the accuracy of reports that a doctoral student and philosophy instructor at the university of california berkeley had provoked outrage , especially among right - leaning observers , by remarking that people in rural america were “ bad people who have made bad life decisions .” <PARA> on nov . 12 , fox news published an <MASK> with the headline “ uc berkeley instructor calls rural americans ‘ bad people ’ who deserve ‘ uncomfortable ’ lives ,” which reported that : <PARA> similar <MASK> were also published by the right - leaning websites breitbart , pj media , and campus reform . <PARA> kernion did indeed attract the ire of many online commentators with a series of tweets on nov . 5 , in which he outlined , apparently in earnest , his views about the sustainability of living in rural america , and the character of those who chose to do so . kernion ’ s twitter account is no longer available , but many of the key tweets in question were archived and can be viewed here . <PARA> he wrote : <PARA> when another user responded to kernion with a point about health care in rural america , kernion replied : “ i ’ m generally in favor of crushing rural america through market mechanisms ...” <PARA> another user asked ironically , “ is this your campaign slogan ?” kernion responded by declaring : <PARA> “ i unironically embrace the bashing of rural americans . they , as a group , are bad people who have made bad life decisions . some , i assume , are good people . but this nostalgia for some imagined pastoral way of life is stupid and we should shame people who aren ’ t pro - city .” <PARA> kernion certainly made the remarks attributed to him in various subsequent news reports . although those news reports typically did not provide the full context of his twitter thread and exchanges with other users , the reports did not substantively distort the meaning or sense of what kernion wrote . <PARA> there was arguably a hint of irony to his remarks . for example , he wrote ( of rural americans ) “ some , i assume , are good people ” — an apparent nod to donald trump ’ s infamous description of mexican people at his 2015 presidential campaign launch . <PARA> in a later tweet , kernion reflected on the heavy backlash against his comments , writing “ what i thought would read as cheeky hyperbole did * not * read as such ...” which suggests there may have been an element of humorous exaggeration behind what he wrote about rural americans . <PARA> however , these factors are counterbalanced by the obvious fact that kernion stipulated “ i unironically embrace the bashing of rural americans ,” and that he later articulated a measure of earnest contrition , writing , “ pretty sure i did a bad tweet here . gonna delete it . i ’ ll want to reflect on it more later , but my tone is way crasser and meaner than i like to think i am .” <PARA> in an email , kernion told snopes “ there ’ s both a substantive aspect to my <MASK> tweets and a semi - humorous aspect to my <MASK> tweets ... but i ’ m not sure i want to go down the rabbit hole of doing a line - by - line annotation of what i was thinking / wanting to communicate .” <PARA> he added that his tweets had , until nov . 5 , typically reached only a small audience whom he “ expected to understand ” what he was trying to convey . when the thread he published on that day was exposed to a much wider audience , kernion said , “ they read into it attitudes that i do not hold .” <PARA> he reiterated that he had retracted and deleted his twitter thread and would continue to “ reflect on it .”",2019-11-20 22:05:39+00:00,test_698,test,info

1,"misinformation about the antebellum south , the civil war , and the confederate flag is rife on the internet . perhaps nowhere more so than in a widespread and ironically titled “ truth about confederate <MASK> ” <MASK> . <PARA> in the wake of the june 2015 racially motivated shooting that left nine people dead at the emanuel african methodist episcopal church in charleston , south carolina , and the renewed debate that event prompted about the propriety of displaying confederate flags on the grounds of the south carolina <MASK> capital ( and elsewhere ), a long - circulating <MASK> advertised as dispelling “ <MASK> and inaccuracies of confederate and southern <MASK> ” attracted renewed interest . <PARA> addressing and correcting the many inaccuracies and misleading <MASK> contained in that piece would require a very lengthy <MASK> , so we have chosen to tackle it here in smaller , more easily digestible chunks . in this , our first installment , we will focus on several sections of that piece about “ the confederate flag ” — which requires that we first provide a brief <MASK> of the confederate flag ( or , more accurately , the several confederate flags ). <PARA> the flag that officially represented the government and nation identifying itself as the confederate <MASK> of america ( csa ) for the first two years of that entity ’ s existence was adopted on 4 march 1861 . patterned after the u . s . national flag (“ the stars and stripes ”), it featured two large red horizontal stripes above and below a large white stripe , and a blue canton in the upper left bearing a circular pattern of white stars equal in number to the number of <MASK> in the confederacy ( and like the u . s . national flag , more stars were added to the design as additional <MASK> were admitted to the confederacy ). this is the flag ( which was the csa ’ s national flag until 1 may 1863 ) that was known as the “ stars and bars ,” not the confederate battle flag to which that term is now commonly applied : <PARA> the first confederate national flag bore 7 stars representing the first seven <MASK> to secede from the u . s . and band together as the confederate <MASK> of america : south carolina , mississippi , florida , alabama , georgia , louisiana , and texas . the flag was revised 21 may 1861 to incorporate two more stars for the seceded <MASK> of virginia and arkansas , again on 2 july 1861 to incorporate two more stars for the seceded <MASK> of tennessee and north carolina , and yet again on 28 november 1861 to incorporate another two stars for the <MASK> of kentucky and missouri . ( although neither of the latter two <MASK> formally seceded from the united <MASK> nor was controlled by a confederate - aligned government , both were <MORE> in - chief and not the official national flag of nazi - era germany : <PARA> another “ myth vs . fact ” section <MASK> : <PARA> herein lies the problem with symbols : they have no inherent meanings ; they have only whatever meanings people choose to read into them , and different people can associate very different meanings with the same symbol . the confederate battle flag is now regarded in many different ways — as a symbol of slavery , as a rallying banner for white supremacists , as a quaint historical artifact , as a memorial to those who fought gallantly and bravely ( even if it was in the service of cause no longer considered virtuous ), as a general emblem of rebellion against authority , as a benign display of regional pride , or even as a fond reminder of two “ good ol ’ boys ” who were “ never meanin ’ no harm .” <PARA> it is <MASK> that for several decades after the civil war , the confederate battle flag was not widely regarded as a negative symbol . its use was largely limited to historical ceremonies associated with veterans ’ events and war memorials ; the flag did not become the symbol most prominently associated with the confederacy until several decades after the civil war ended , and it was not widely perceived as a politically polarizing symbol until it was appropriated by segregationist politicians and groups in the middle of the twentieth century . <PARA> however , the fact remains that the confederate battle flag has long since become the pre - eminent symbol of the confederacy and what it stood for , and across the span of several decades it has been co - opted by segregationist and white supremacist groups such as the dixiecrats , the kkk , and the aryan nation . certainly one can be a racist or a white supremacist without associating himself with “ southern pride ” or a confederate battle flag , but for better or worse , no one group is any more “ authorized ” to use the confederate battle flag as their symbol than another . the confederate government and its military forces ceased to exist 150 years ago and therefore have no say or control over the usage of the southern cross . <PARA> the sons of confederate veterans may sincerely object to the confederate battle flag ’ s use by neo - nazis , skinheads , and other extremist groups , and perhaps some of the men who fought and died for the confederacy would as well if they were alive today . but just as with the swastika , it ’ s likely to be a very , very long time before that symbol can be <MASK> and regarded in anything approaching a neutral manner , and probably not until the social issues underlying the public perception of that symbol have been more thoroughly canvassed .",2015-06-28T19:21:05+00:00,train_6542,train,misinfo

1,"as american cities erupted in protests against racism and police brutality following the death of george floyd in minneapolis in may 2020 , social media users began spreading posts alleging that some group — or person — with nefarious intentions had coordinated a scheme to incite and abet violence during the demonstrations by pre - placing piles of bricks along protest routes . <PARA> the <MASK> could be summarized like this : government officials , law enforcement , billionaires , or protesters themselves had strategically placed caches of cinder blocks in cities nationwide — including boston , dallas , kansas city , and new york city — so protesters could quickly grab the bricks and break windows or cause other property damage . among the most popular posts was a video of someone who recorded a pile of bricks purportedly near a dallas courthouse and called the pallets a “ setup ” while another person <MASK> , “ they put them there on purpose , bro .'” <PARA> it is unequivocally <MASK> that protesters in many major u . s . cities used bricks to cause destruction ( or , in some cases , to injure police ) during the protests against police brutality following the death of george floyd — a 46 - year - old , unarmed black man who died after a white minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes . <PARA> but less is known about where , or from whom , the protesters got the bricks , and if the <MASK> on social media alleging a coordinated scheme on behalf of government , activists , or a powerful figure had any truth . <PARA> what follows is a multi - prong examination into the <MASK> . first , we describe the different groups behind the assertion , and then we investigate this specific theory : that the government , police , or another powerful entity formed a scheme to pre - place the bricks along protest routes so officers could retaliate against people who used them or to incite destruction . lastly , we examine the possibility that the bricks were strategically placed on streets by protesters themselves . <PARA> an array of people <MASK> pallets of bricks appeared in protest hot spots as some nefarious scheme , essentially forming three distinct groups that blamed different entities or people for the alleged conspiracy . <PARA> first , some people said police officers or government authorities pre - placed the stacks of bricks to create what protesters called a “ trap ” set up by officers to quickly catch anyone who used them and have a reason to use excessive force . many believers of that theory used the hashtag # baitbricks on social media to spread awareness of the alleged government - run scheme and circulated the below - displayed poster as a safety message for protesters : <PARA> they included followers of the qanon movement and accounts that suggested without <MORE> our protest ” were part of a construction project , and the department asked the contractor to remove them from the street . <PARA> a similar <MASK> played out in fort myers , florida , where city officials told the local nbc news <MASK> the bricks in question were part of a project to install optic fiber in the area . “ the bricks have been here for a long time ,” said a resident , who works in the downtown area . <PARA> meanwhile , in fayetteville , north carolina , someone recorded a video in which viewers can see protesters and what the narrator called “ some random - ass bricks ” near them . but those stacks , too , had apparently been in the area before demonstrations began and were part of a project to improve the walkway for pedestrians . <PARA> a video that was uploaded to youtube on may 24 ( the day before floyd ’ s death ) about the city ’ s reopening during the covid - 19 pandemic confirmed this theory ( it shows the bricks ), as well as a 2018 document called “ fayetteville comprehensive pedestrian plan ” that listed the site as one in need of crosswalk and signal improvements . additionally , bbc misinformation specialists confirmed with the city of fayetteville that construction crews had placed the bricks on the sidewalk recently for restoration work . <PARA> those misunderstandings aside , at least two government - run departments — the kansas city police and houston public works — said they had received and investigated reports of “ bricks and rocks ” during the demonstrations . <PARA> the former agency — without providing photographic <MASK> or further details — suggested the “ stashes ” were purposefully placed “ to be used during a riot ,” essentially suggesting an effort by someone or a group to cause property destruction with the cinder blocks . <PARA> furthermore , in reference to the <MASK> that protesters , perhaps those who consider themselves anti - fascists , had pre - placed the bricks , it is important to note that not all activists who resist fascism use weapons or cause property destruction during protests . however , some antifa members believe any violence that does occur during protests is a form of self - defense to combat extreme right - wing ideologies . <PARA> in sum , since no <MASK> suggests there was a coordinated effort on behalf of government entities or billionaires to pre - place bricks on protest routes to incite violence during the 2020 demonstrations against police brutality , and considering the amount and variety of <MASK> that showed many of the reports of suspicious bricks on social media were misunderstandings , we rate this <MASK> “ mostly <MASK> ” — with the caveat that it is possible that antifa members or other protesters could have strategically placed bricks in easily accessible spots to facilitate causing property damage .",2020-06-04 16:06:55+00:00,test_88,test,misinfo

1,"on feb . 25 , 2020 , during a democratic primary debate in south carolina , u . s . sen . elizabeth warren held a robust back - and - forth exchange with fellow candidate and former new york mayor mike bloomberg . at one point warren told a <MASK> that she has told many times before ⁠— how her time as a public school instructor came to an end , and how that spurred her on to a career in public service . on that particular occasion , she also segued into an attack on bloomberg , as follows : <PARA> it ’ s a <MASK> warren has made on several occasions . in her 2014 book “ a fighting chance ,” she wrote : <PARA> “ in 1970 , just after i finished college in houston , jim was transferred to ibm ’ s office in new jersey . soon after we moved , i got my first real job , as a speech therapist for special needs kids at a nearby public school . i was twenty - one , but i looked about fourteen . by the end of the school year , i was pretty obviously pregnant . the principal did what i think a lot of principals did back then — wished me good luck , didn ’ t ask me back for the next school year , and hired someone else for the job .” <PARA> at a rally in oakland , california , in may 2019 , warren told largely the same <MASK> , in much the same way , <MASK> that the principal , upon seeing that warren was pregnant , “ wished me luck , showed me the door , and hired someone else for the job .” <PARA> the board of education in riverdale , new jersey , hired warren as a speech therapy instructor in the fall of 1970 . according to local news reports , warren worked two days per week . <PARA> the following spring , in april 1971 , the board approved a new contract for warren , according to riverdale board of education minutes first published by the right - leaning washington free beacon in october 2019 . the minutes for the april 21 , 1971 , meeting show that the board voted unanimously to approve “ issuance of contracts ” to several teachers , including warren , for the following school year . <PARA> the next day , apr . 22 , the news of paterson , new jersey , reported that warren was one of 10 non - tenure teachers “ hired ” and “ appointed ” by the riverdale board of education , although the <MASK> noted that “ the 1971 - 72 contract has not been settled .” <PARA> in telling the <MASK> of how her employment at a new jersey public school district came to an end , warren never mentioned the fact that the board of education <MORE> someone else for the job . and that was it . i lost my job . ” <PARA> the executive principal at riverdale at that time was edward pruzinsky , who died in 1999 . as a result , we cannot verify the accuracy of warren ’ s description of that conversation , or even whether such a conversation took place . without any documentary <MASK> for a private conversation between warren and pruzinsky , we can ’ t corroborate nor dismiss her <MASK> that she lost her job as a result of becoming pregnant . as a result , we are issuing a rating of “ unproven ” and left to examine the plausibility of her <MASK> , if not its accuracy . <PARA> warren ’ s 2019 / 20 account is plausible . broadly speaking , women in the united <MASK> in the early 1970s were indeed subject to employment discrimination — whether formal or informal , blatant or subtle — in the event that they became pregnant . the first substantial legal protections against such discrimination came with the 1978 pregnancy discrimination act . <PARA> warren ’ s <MASK> also appear plausible in the specific context of riverdale school district . in 2019 cbs news spoke to two former teachers who worked at riverdale at the same time as warren . one of them said , “ the rule was at five months you had to leave when you were pregnant . now , if you didn ’ t tell anybody you were pregnant and they didn ’ t know , you could fudge it and try to stay on a little bit longer . but they kind of wanted you out if you were pregnant .” <PARA> the fact that local newspapers reported that warren had resigned in order to “ raise a family ,” and that school board minutes stipulated that board members had voted to “ accept with regret ” her resignation , do not hold significant weight . a school board official could quite plausibly have informally forced or persuaded warren to resign her post , allowing them to present what was an act of discrimination as a young mother ’ s regrettable but voluntary choice . <PARA> however , we cannot rule out the possibility that warren , as she indicated in her 2007 interview , did indeed decide for herself that she did not have the requisite qualifications to continue as a speech therapist for the time being , and that she , with her first child on the way , made a voluntary choice without pressure from school board officials to decline the new contract that was on the table . <PARA> the senator ’ s 2019 / 20 account of how her time as a public school instructor came to an end is plausible , but its credibility is undermined by the fact that she did not provide the same explanation when she discussed the issue in 2007 .",2020-03-02 23:15:15+00:00,test_1073,test,misinfo

1,"one of the more unusual and complicated theories associated with the sovereign citizen and tax protester movements is the belief that lawyers who are members of bar associations in the united <MASK> are , in fact , agents of the british crown and do not have legitimate <MASK> in american courts . this theory is partly informed by a <MASK> but widely repeated <MASK> that the word “ bar ” in this context is an acronym for “ british accreditation register ”: <PARA> here ’ s how the elaborate and confusing theory is outlined in an anonymously - authored essay called “ hiding behind the bar ,” which has been republished and shared in tax protester and sovereign citizen circles for more than a decade : <PARA> almost every part of this is factually inaccurate . for one thing , the international bar association was founded in 1947 , not in the 1600s . second , we could find no <MASK> of the existence of a professional association for lawyers called the “ british accredited registry ,” either in 2018 or at any previous time in <MASK> . <PARA> a <MASK> of the american bar , a 1911 book by the pulitzer prize - winning legal scholar charles warren , contains no mention of any “ british accredited registry ” or “ british accreditation registry ” ( with “ accredited ” and “ accreditation ” being used variously in different versions of this conspiracy theory ). it would also make little sense for a group of lawyers in 17th century england to form a group describing itself as “ british .” great britain ( composed of england , wales and scotland ) does not have , and has never had , a unified courts system , instead being separated into two systems : england and wales and scotland . in fact , great britain itself was not even formally created until 1707 , when the acts of union joined the kingdom of scotland with the kingdom of england ( which included wales ). <PARA> but more broadly , this theory offers a confused summary of the <MASK> of “ the bar .” <PARA> in the middle ages , lawyers in london established four “ inns of court ”: lincoln ’ s inn , the inner temple , the middle temple , and gray ’ s inn . these were physical buildings but , more figuratively , they were also the professional associations for lawyers working in the more important english courts . a “ barrister ” was a legal expert or advocate who has been “ called to the bar .” this is a metonymic phrase which is rooted in the physical barrier that was present in a courtroom , to separate fully qualified lawyers entitled to plead cases before a judge from ( roughly speaking ) trainee lawyers and members of the public . in modern times , this physical barrier generally separates participants in a trial ( such <MORE> from one lord to another .” that essay also <MASK> : <PARA> that passage is <MASK> . whatever the older <MASK> of the word “ attorney ” might be , the modern definition of that word is much broader . merriam -

1,"the <MASK> that undergoing an abortion increases a woman ’ s chances of contracting breast cancer , often cited by anti - abortion activists , arguably has two <MASK> : a scientific one and a political one . its scientific <MASK> have their roots in the 1980s and 1990s , with a series of studies investigating a link between induced abortions and an increased risk of breast cancer . those early studies were ambiguous — no matter what side of the abortion issue one was on , one could ( and still can ) find a study to support their preferred narrative . <PARA> from a scientific standpoint , the issue is no longer ambiguous . after an authoritative 1997 study utilizing government - collected data on every danish women born between 1935 and 1978 concluded there was no increased risk of breast cancer from abortions , organizations such as the world health organization , u . s . national cancer institute , american cancer society , and many others now reject the existence of any such link . the conclusions drawn from that study , as published in the new england journal of medicine ( nejm ), were that : <PARA> from a political standpoint , the issue saw a resurgence in attention under the socially conservative administration of george w . bush , which changed the language on an national cancer institute fact sheet regarding breast cancer and abortions against the wishes of that organization ’ s scientists . this issue was discussed , later , in an august 2003 us congressional report from the committee on oversight and government reform that investigated changes to science policy under the bush administration : <PARA> the notion that reproductive choices affect breast cancer risk is not new , nor is it controversial . it is widely accepted , for example , that carrying a pregnancy to term reduces one ’ s risk of developing breast cancer later in life . this issue is often conflated with the question of abortions increasing a woman ’ s risk , because since carrying a pregnancy to term may reduce risk of breast cancer , having an abortion may offset that reduced risk . that is not the question at hand , however : the question , strictly defined , is ‘ will having an abortion make you more likely to get breast cancer when compared to women who never give birth ?’ <PARA> the scientific basis for the breast cancer - abortion link has its roots , most notably , in a 1980 paper in the american journal of pathology that investigated one potential mechanism proposed for relationships between abortion and breast cancer : that leftover undifferentiated cells in a woman ’ s breast ( which occur as part of hormonal changes that help to prepare a woman for breastfeeding and appear during pregnancy , and which would become fully differentiated by the end of a pregnancy ) are more susceptible to cancer <MORE> studies , discussed above , aimed to demonstrate ( successfully ) that case - control studies are a poor design to analyze a purported connection between abortions and breast cancer . <PARA> two of the listed studies included on the list were not , strictly speaking , studies , as they were conference presentations that received little to no peer review ( i . e . laing et al 1994 , bu et al 1995 ). many of the studies on the list ( e . g ., segi et al 1957 , daling et al 1994 , daling et al 1996 ) cautioned that while they may have demonstrated correlations , their data were not sufficient to establish causation or even to represent actual trends . <PARA> four of the studies on the list reached conclusions explicitly counter to the <MASK> that they demonstrate an increased risk of breast in populations of women who have had abortions : <PARA> arguably the most notable publication on this list , both in scope and in citations , is a 1996 paper authored by brind himself ( who created this list in the first place ), a meta -

harris clean energy policy proposes “ banning new oil and gas permitting on public lands and waters .” it does not propose an outright ban on fracking . in recent years , federal lands have accounted for around 10 % of u . s . oil and gas production , so biden ’ s policy would allow the vast majority of fracking to continue , especially at first , since it would only stop new leases . <PARA> as the washington post has reported , biden has repeatedly emphasized on the campaign trail that he would not ban fracking , but would instead seek to end new leases on federal lands . on one occasion , during a primary debate in march 2020 , biden caused confusion about his policy on fracking . he had the following exchange with u . s . sen . bernie sanders of vermont : <PARA> later in the debate , sanders pointed to the absence of a complete ban on fracking from biden ’ s platform , saying : “ you cannot continue , <MORE> on federal lands , but does not call for an outright ban on fracking . <PARA> during the oct . 8 vice presidential debate , pence said : <PARA> “ i know joe biden says otherwise now , as you do , but the both of you repeatedly committed to abolishing fossil fuel and [ the ] banning of fracking .” <PARA> the official biden - harris platform proposes to end fossil fuel subsidies , and to encourage a worldwide ban on fossil fuel subsidies . during a campaign event in somersworth , new hampshire , in february 2020 , biden told hecklers ( 9 : 45 ), “ we are going to get rid of fossil fuels ,” but then he added , “ we ’ re going to phase out fossil fuels .” <PARA> at a town hall event in new castle , new hampshire , in september 2019 , biden told an audience member ( 25 : 17 ), “ i guarantee you we ’ re going to end fossil fuel .” this prompted an attack by pence during the october 2020 debate . the vice president said : “ joe biden looked a supporter in the eye and pointed and said , ‘ i guarantee , i guarantee that we will abolish fossil fuels .'” <PARA> however , what pence failed to mention was what biden said next : “ before 2050 , god willing . no , it can ’ t be done by 2030 . no . there is not one single person that ’ s argued it can be done by then . but it can be done by 2050 , it may be 2045 .” <PARA> during the primaries , harris ’ platform called for “ replacing dirty fossil fuels with clean renewable energy ,” proposed to “ phase out all fossil fuel development on public lands ” and <MASK> : “ we must begin intentionally and deliberately transitioning away from fossil fuels , shifting from being an exporter of fossil fuels to an exporter of clean energy technology .” <PARA> there ’ s no doubt that both biden and harris , like many others , are proposing a broad , long - term transition away from fossil fuels to what is known as “ clean energy .” in their platforms , both have emphasized new employment opportunities and protections for workers whose jobs and livelihoods are affected by that transition , which they say will take decades . as we ’ ve shown , biden has explicitly <MASK> that the phasing out of fossil fuels cannot be completed until 2045 at the earliest — a 25 -

1,"the “ one ring ” telephone scam is similar in form to the venerable 809 area code scam in that both involve trying to dupe unwary phone customers into calling a foreign phone number in order to stick them with hefty charges . while the 809 scam involved sending pages , faxes , voicemails , or e - mail messages that supposedly relayed important information ( e . g ., news about a distressed family member or a notification of prize winnings ) in order to lure the recipient into calling a provided phone number , the “ one ring ” scam employs a simpler technique — the scammers place calls to blocks of phone numbers ( sometimes with the use of robo - call devices ), disconnect each call after a single ring , and hope that the owners of some of those numbers will be curious enough to call back : <PARA> once hooked , the victims of the “ one ring ” scam are supposedly separated from their money through a variety of means : keeping them on the line for as long as possible while they rack up international call tolls , duping them into unknowingly calling premium - rate phone numbers ( akin to the 900 pay - per - call services ), or enticing them into signing up for pricey services , as described in a may 2019 alert issued by the federal communications commission ( fcc ): <PARA> as with the 809 scam , however , it appears that the prevalence of the one - ring scam and the potential damages its victims might suffer are considerably lower than exaggerated warnings about it often suggest : <PARA> it ’ s certainly not <MASK> , as <MASK> in the example cited above , that the mere act of calling a particular number would allow a phone user ’ s contacts and banking information to be stolen by someone else . that sort of information would be compromised only if another party somehow hacked into the user ’ s phone ( via a malicious app or other code ) and / or the user actively did something to enable access to it . ( in either case , there ’ s no obvious reason why such a scheme would require the victim to place a call to the information - stealer rather than the other way around .) <PARA> some versions of this warning maintain that “ you may also be charged a monthly fee for joining some club you know nothing about . by calling the number , you ‘ authorize ’ them to place a fee on your cellphone bill .” however , it seems to be more the case that victims aren ’ t subscribed to services simply through the act of calling a phone number , but rather that the scammers use social engineering techniques ( including harassment ) to persuade them to subscribe to pay services or give out their credit card information : <PARA> other versions of the warning caution that cell phone owners who return one - ring calls are charged $ 19 . 95 for an “ international call fee ” and then a “$ 9 . 00 per minute charge ” on top of that . but verizon currently lists rates for placing calls to the 222 country code mentioned in the above fcc alert ( mauritania ) at about $ 3 . 00 per minute , so a victim who returned such a call and stayed on the line for a couple of minutes before hanging up might realistically be out $ 6 or so in toll charges . phone customers can generally get any “ premium service ” ( i . e ., “ international call fee ”) charges tacked on to such a call reversed by contacting their phone service providers and documenting the circumstances of the call . <PARA> many forms of this warning list specific country / area codes that phone users should never place calls to ( because of their association with various phone scams ), including 473 ( grenada ), 268 ( antigua ), 876 ( jamaica ), 809 ( the dominican republic ), 375 ( belarus ), 371 ( latvia ), 222 ( mauritania ), and 284 ( the british virgin islands ). there is , of course , nothing wrong with connecting to numbers with these country / area codes if you happen to know whom you ’ re calling : all cautions regarding the one - ring scam ( and similar schemes ) apply only to solicitations to contact entities unknown to you . if you have to call a number associated with a dialing code that ’ s unfamiliar to you , you can use a code lookup site to check it out first .",2012-10-26T00:13:34+00:00,test_1360,test,misinfo

1,"on aug . 22 , 2019 , the epoch times ran a profile of a “ 15 - year - old science buff ” who invented a 100 % effective diagnostic test for pancreatic cancer . this was a curious editorial decision , as the 15 - year - old in question was 22 in 2019 , and the more sensational <MASK> he had made years ago had been significantly tempered — facts andraka himself has acknowledged but that did not make their way into the epoch times <MASK> . <PARA> first , here ’ s what the <MASK> gets right . as a 15 - year - old , jack andraka gained fame for prototyping a potential test for pancreatic cancer that was purportedly quicker and cheaper than existing methods , for which he was awarded the grand prize at the 2012 intel international science and engineering fair . in 2014 , then - forbes healthcare reporter ( and current medical reporter at <MASK> ) matthew herper described the concept this way : <PARA> herper , in his capacity as the author of that year ’ s forbes 30 under 30 list of promising young scientists , had reviewed a draft of a paper andraka had written about his test along with six other expert reviewers . in a piece titled “ why biotech whiz kid jack andraka is not on the forbes 30 under 30 list ,” he relayed the concerns of five anonymous reviewers and one non - anonymous reviewer : harvard dna sequencing pioneer george church . church concluded that many of the <MASK> “ may not hold up , or at least require more work to be proven .” <PARA> others , like the pancreatic cancer researcher who discovered mesothelin in the first place , ira paston , had gone further . in a 2015 sydney morning herald piece , paston <MASK> that the method andraka proposed “ makes no scientific sense ,” and that paston didn ’ t “ know anybody in the scientific community who believes his findings .” <PARA> andraka , for his part , has also recognized that the problem is more complex than his earlier <MASK> might have suggested . in an email to herper in 2014 , andraka wrote : <PARA> here we get into the weeds of the <MASK> made ( most recently ) by the epoch times , but which form the basis of other continually recurring clickbait stories . <PARA> in a 2012 tedx talk , among other places , andraka <MASK> that his test was “ 168 times faster , 26 , 000 times less expensive , and 400 times more sensitive .” any reporting citing these numbers is merely repeating , uncritically , <MASK> which misrepresent the time and cost of existing technology . one of the few existing methods for pancreatic cancer detection is via elisa ( enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ) tests . specifically , elisa tests that identify the presence <MORE> hours to run . suggesting it takes 14 hours inflates significantly the speed comparison in favor of andraka ’ s test . <PARA> church also <MASK> that the cost comparison employed by andraka was flawed because it compared only the manufacturing costs on his invention ’ s side but included profit and overhead on the elisa test side : <PARA> as for sensitivity , church argued that the results presented by andraka varied too much to say anything about sensitivity ( a measure that gets at potential <MASK> positives ). <PARA> andraka was able to spend six months in the lab of a johns hopkins medical center researcher where he tested his test using blood from mice who had pancreatic cancer compared to those who didn ’ t . such tests , even if they produced promising results , would not be the same as demonstrating efficacy as a diagnostic tool for pancreatic cancer in humans . <PARA> outside of accuracy — i . e ., the ability to correctly identify humans with pancreatic cancer — the early detection of the disease was also central to the project , something andraka would not have been able to test directly for his work at hopkins . ira pastan , the national cancer institutes researcher who discovered mesothelin , the biomarker used in andraka ’ s test , told the sydney morning herald that the protein is not actually elevated in the blood in early pancreatic cancer patients and thus could not be indicative of the early stages of the disease . other scientific studies support pastan ’ s objection . <PARA> a 2013 study into the diagnostic efficacy of mesothelin on pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma ( a form of pancreatic cancer ) concluded that the biomarker was “ a weak diagnostic classifier on its own ” but may be of use as part of a larger panel test . mesothelin is also present in cases of other cancers as well , including “ malignant mesothelioma and ... ovarian , and lung adenocarcinomas . in a 2015 <MASK> provided to sydney morning herald reporter nick bryant by john hopkins university , the institution made clear the results were far too preliminary to declare such accuracy or to speculate on its future success : <PARA> andraka does not hold an international patent on his device . although he applied for one in 2012 , that application was ultimately denied based on lacking an “ inventive step .” <PARA> all told , media outlets like the epoch times continue to run with an out - of - date and highly clickable fairytale that has not been accurate since at least 2014 . andraka himself acknowledges the shortcomings of his earlier scientific pronouncements and is thankful for the criticism he has received , telling ( for example ) the sydney morning herald in 2015 that “ i really appreciate their concerns because their concerns made my project better . it was definitely a learning curve .”",2019-09-04 15:44:30+00:00,test_401,test,misinfo

1,"when restaurant workers place a lemon wedge on your glass of water , tea , or soda , they are apparently spiking your drink with germs . <PARA> a new study by a new jersey microbiologist found nasty bacteria on two - thirds of the lemons that were tested from 21 restaurants . <PARA> “ it was gross ,” said anne lagrange loving , assistant science professor at passaic county community college .” <PARA> loving decided to do the study after noticing a waitress with dirty fingernails delivering a drink to a table . <PARA> “ they put lemon in my diet coke , i didn ’ t ask for it , and so i decided to do a study .” <PARA> loving and her team swabbed for bacteria as soon as drinks hit the table at restaurants all around paterson , new jersey . <PARA> “ you would think they had dipped the lemons in raw meat ,” she said , referring to the high levels of bacteria that she found . <PARA> the swabs of lemon wedges revealed everything from high counts of fecal bacteria to a couple of dozen other microorganisms — most of which can make you sick . they found bacteria on the rind and on the flesh of the lemons . <PARA> health laws require lemons to be handled with gloves or tongs . but its common practice for waiters and waitresses to simply pop the little lemon wedge onto a drinking glass with their bare hands . <PARA> if an employee ’ s hands aren ’ t clean , however , then touching the lemons is likely to contaminate them with bacteria according to loving . <PARA> this is not the first time that anne loving has gone looking for bacteria in unusual places . she did a study several years ago and found bacteria on communion cups . <PARA> “ you ’ d just have to know me ,” she laughed . “ i ’ m a germ freak .” <PARA> but , loving says , the results of the study point to a significant problem . <PARA> “ people need to know that the lemons have bacteria on them that can make them sick .” <PARA> <MASK> : the <MASK> cited above references a study ( published in <PARA> the journal of environmental health in december 2007 and co - authored by anne lagrange loving , an assistant professor of science at passaic county community college ) in which a total of 76 lemon wedges served with water or soda were sampled from 21 different restaurants and analyzed for microbial growth . the study found that 69 . 7 % of the lemon wedges sampled produced some form of microbial growth from the rind and / or the flesh , encompassing a total of 25 different microorganisms including bacteria and yeasts . the study noted that “ the microbes found on the lemon samples in our investigation all have the potential to cause infectious diseases at various body sites .” <PARA> however , this study in itself doesn ’ t demonstrate that restaurant patrons are at high risk for contracting some serious illnesses due to food workers ’ not observing sufficiently rigorous sanitary standards . for one thing , the study did not determine the <MASK> of the microbial contaminants : <PARA> it is not possible to definitively identify the <MASK> of the microorganisms . while the enterobacteriaceae and nonfermentative gramnegative bacilli could have come from the fingertips of a restaurant employee via human fecal or raw - meat or poultry contamination , they might have contaminated the lemons before they even arrived at the restaurant . the gram - positive cocci and corynebacterium isolates may have been introduced onto the lemons from the skin or oral flora of anyone who handled them , before or after they arrived in the restaurant . the bacillus species are ubiquitous and could have had numerous sources , including airborne spores landing on the fruit or on the knife used to cut the lemon . <PARA> the study also did not determine the likelihood of customers ’ contracting infectious diseases from restaurant - served lemon wedges , nor did it cite any examples of such an occurrence : <PARA> [ t ] he likelihood [ of the microbes ’ causing infectious diseases ] was not determined in this study . an extensive search of the literature yielded no reported outbreaks or illnesses attributed to lemon slices in beverages . establishment of an infection would depend upon the number of microbes introduced ; this investigation did not include a quantitative determination of the numbers of microorganisms on the lemons . other factors that would contribute to the establishment of an infection would include whether the organisms were resistant to multiple antibiotics , the general health and age of the individual , the <MASK> of the immune system , and the integrity of the mucous membranes of the lips and mouth . <PARA> what the study uncovered , basically , is a potential problem that requires more study : <PARA> although lemons have known antimicrobial properties , the results of our study indicate that a wide variety of microorganisms may survive on the flesh and the rind of a sliced lemon . restaurant patrons should be aware that lemon slices added to beverages may include potentially pathogenic microbes . further investigations could determine the source of these microorganisms , establish the actual threat ( if any ) posed by their presence on the rim of a beverage , and develop possible means for preventing the contamination of the lemons . it could also be worthwhile to study contamination on other beverage garnishes , such as olives , limes , celery , and cherries , and to investigate whether alcoholic beverages have an effect not seen with water and soda .",2014-05-30T16:27:46+00:00,train_1244,train,misinfo

( a short - sale is a sale where the banks accepts less money than is owed on the home ). after some chit - chat , she proceeded to tell us that she and her sister ( who also lived in the area ) were buying each other ’ s homes via the short - sale process . i mentioned to her that i thought relatives could not be involved in those transactions . she smiled and said “ we have two different last names so no one knows the difference ”. <PARA> she went on to tell us that each of them owed over 100k on their homes and were in the process of buying each other ’ s homes for about 10 - 15k cash . to top it off , they were each receiving $ 3 , 000 . 00 in government provided relocation assistance at the closing . <PARA> my buyers and i were amazed that she was outright admitting to fraud and yet , she continued . she began to tell us that the best part of her scheme was that because they currently were not working that they ( both ) are now receiving section 8 vouchers . i said i thought those were for renters and she said “ that ’ s the best part ; me and my sister are going to be renting each other ’ s homes so we don ’ t even have to move , and obama is going to give us each $ 800 . 00 a month to pay the rent !” she then picked up a picture she had framed of obama and did a little happy dance around her living room and while she kissed the picture she was singing “ thank you obama .... thank you obama .” <PARA> so here is the bottom line ... both of these scammers got at least $ 80 , 000 . 00 in debt forgiven , $ 3 , 000 . 00 in cash for relocation ( when in fact they did not relocate ) and to boot , you and i will now be paying ( through our taxes ) $ 1 , 600 . 00 in rent for each them each and every month .... perhaps forever ! <PARA> and i also would not be at all surprised if they are receiving food stamps and whatever other programs are available for <MORE> on a property that he <MASK> bought for $ 900 , 000 but that is now valued at only $ 300 , 000 , his property is described as being under water . the second refers to a process which has been used by some borrowers to keep afloat financially by shedding their under water properties . <PARA> when a property owner holds an under water mortgage and can no longer make his mortgage payments , one remedy is for the lienholder to agree to a short sale : that is , to allow the owner to sell the property for less than the amount still owed on the loan . a short sale leaves the lender taking a loss , but it is often preferable to the alternative of the lender ’ s having to foreclose on the property and resell it <PARA> themselves ( with no guarantee the resale would bring in any more money than the short sale did ). <PARA> the unpaid balance still owed to a lienholder by the property owner after a short sale is known as a “ deficiency .” if the owner with the aforementioned $ 600 , 000 mortgage short sells his home for $ 250 , 000 , he has incurred a $ 350 , 000 deficiency . a short sale may or may not relieve the borrower of the obligation to repay that deficiency : whether it does depends on the agreement made between the lienholder and the property owner prior to the short sale . ( the amount of a deficiency is considered by the irs to be a benefit which is taxable as income , but the mortgage forgiveness debt relief act of 2007 currently allows taxpayers to exclude income from a discharge of debt on their principal residence .) <PARA> the january 2013 item reproduced above purportedly tells of two women who are supposedly gaming the system by agreeing to buy each other ’ s homes at short sales ( in contravention of the rules ), then collect a monthly housing assistance stipend for being renters in the homes they formerly owned . the item contains no verifiable details such as names , dates , or addresses ( only the mention of a city or <MASK> which changes from version to version ), but the scenario described would require a number of implausibilities to all be <MASK> : <PARA> also , little of what is referenced here has any direct connection to president obama . although the hafa program which provides $ 3 , 000 in relocation assistance was introduced by the treasury department under the obama administration in 2009 , the mortgage forgiveness debt relief act ( which exempts deficiencies in short sales from being considered taxable income ) was passed in 2007 during the administration of george w . bush , and section 8 housing assistance was established under the housing act of 1937 passed during the administration of franklin d . roosevelt .",2015-01-22T13:04:36+00:00,train_3684,train,misinfo

called “ trackers ”: <PARA> a verified google employee responded to the query on the same forum : <PARA> the exposure notifications is an application programming interface ( api ), not a phone application , that offers app developers a number of standardized operations they can use . developers working for public health agencies around the world issue applications using this api created by apple and google . the google employee emphasized that if the user opted not to download any application that used that notification , then the notification would not be turned on and would not be able to collect any data . <PARA> if android users click on the covid - 19 notifications feature , which is available through google settings , they have to both install a participating app from their region to activate the exposure notifications and enable bluetooth to use the feature . <PARA> on may 20 , google and apple announced the official rollout of the exposure notification api , which uses bluetooth technology to help governments reduce the spread of covid - 19 . apple and google barred authorities from using their technology to collect gps data or require users to enter personal data . the companies are relying on encrypted bluetooth metadata to identify person -

19 diagnosis , and any data collected is only for covid - 19 response efforts . details about how google and apple say they will protect privacy can be found here and here . <PARA> a google representative , however , did confirm “ no connection ” exists between the june 15 mobile phone network outage and the exposure notifications roll - out . <PARA> we should note that privacy advocates from the electronic frontier foundation ( eff ) are wary of google and apple ’ s approach to tracking covid - 19 transmission , and have highlighted a number of security risks , while acknowledging that “ bluetooth proximity is the most promising approach so far to automated covid tracking .” <PARA> in sum , because only one major telecommunications network faced widespread disruptions in june , while the exposure notifications application was rolled out in may , the timing makes the overarching <MASK> that the rollout and the outage are related impossible . in addition , cellphone users must themselves download an app , meaning it can ’ t be sneakily added on phones . that said , although google and apple have said they have put many privacy safeguards in place , critics still question whether those safeguards are adequate . given all of the above , we rate this <MASK> as “ mostly <MASK> .”",2020-06-23 19:39:42+00:00,test_194,test,misinfo

1,"during his 2020 presidential campaign , u . s . president donald trump on multiple occasions <MASK> his democratic opponent joe biden would impose the “ biggest tax increase in <MASK> ” if voters elected him . in an august interview on fox news , for instance , trump said of democrats : <PARA> in the following weeks , he reiterated the <MASK> — that “ you are going to have the tax increase of your life ” if biden wins the 2020 election — in social media posts and during campaign events , without explaining who would bear the brunt of the alleged hike . trump tweeted on oct . 5 : <PARA> below is an analysis of biden ’ s tax proposal assessing whether it would indeed raise taxes by an amount never seen before in modern u . s . <MASK> , and who would most feel its impact . <PARA> according to his campaign website , biden ran for president on the promise that he would change multiple aspects of the country ’ s tax system — specifically in regards to individual income and payroll taxes , business taxes , and tax expenditures . <PARA> the proposed changes would repeal aspects of the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act , which the trump administration and republicans framed as a solution to fuel economic growth , and democrats saw as a gift to the country ’ s richest individuals and large corporations at the expense of low - to - middle - class americans . <PARA> specifically , biden ’ s tax plan would roll back the act ’ s income tax reductions for the country ’ s top bracket of taxpayers , as well as expand that category to include americans with incomes over $ 400 , 000 annually , rather than just those who earn more than $ 518 , 400 . <PARA> his proposal would also require that group of top earners to limit deductions and pay an additional social security payroll tax , per an analysis by howard gleckman , a senior fellow with the nonpartisan urban - brookings tax policy center . millionaires and billionaires would be subject to taxes on long - term capital gains at ordinary — not preferential — income tax rates . <PARA> additionally , biden ’ s plan would increase the top tax rate for corporations from 21 % to 28 % and impose a 15 % minimum tax on companies ’ book income , according to his campaign website . it would also reduce tax subsidies for commercial real <MASK> and fossil fuels and incentivize renewable energy investments , among other changes . <PARA> all of that said , the country ’ s richest taxpayers and corporations would cover the majority of biden ’ s proposed tax increases — not average americans — both in dollar amounts and as a share of their incomes . <PARA> but let ’ s look at the anticipated impact at <MORE> s plan ( we explain more below ), though the highest - income households would pay higher income taxes directly and see substantially larger increases than anyone else . gleckman made the following estimations : <PARA> that added burden on low - and middle - income households — representing about 2 % of the proposed change — would be an indirect result of employers shifting the cost of the higher corporate tax rate to some workers . corporations on a grand scale would slightly lower wages and investment income , which would , on average , more than offset the effects of biden ’ s new tax credits , the center concluded . <PARA> alicyn mcleod , a tax adviser and writer for accounting today , said in october 2020 : <PARA> in sum , the overwhelming majority of americans — those who earn $ 400 , 000 or less annually — would not see their taxes increase as a direct result of biden ’ s tax proposal , and the top 1 % earners would shoulder the brunt of his proposed hike . but low - to - middle - class workers would see slightly lower investment returns and wages as a result of corporate tax increases , according to economists ’ analysis including a a budgetary model by the wharton school of the university of pennsylvania . <PARA> biden ’ s plan would raise about $ 3 . 38 trillion in additional tax revenue over 10 years , according to the university ’ s model . <PARA> concurrently , per gleckman ’ s analysis , that would amount to an increase in federal revenue by about 1 . 5 % of the country ’ s gross domestic product ( gdp ). gdp is the economy ’ s total output of goods and services , and economists rely on it greatly to measure the economy ’ s health and how fiscal or regulatory policies could impact it — not raw dollar amounts that don ’ t consider inflation and population changes . <PARA> to determine the legitimacy of trump ’ s <MASK> , we considered federal tax proposals and their impact on gdp over decades . of almost two dozen congressional tax bills that increased federal tax revenues between 1940 and 2012 , for example , the five largest tax increases raised annual revenue between 1 . 33 % and 5 . 04 % of gdp , according to a 2013 compilation of such records by the u . s . department of treasury . <PARA> the following table compiled by the tax foundation , another independent public policy think tank , showed where biden ’ s plan would stand in comparison to those other proposals : <PARA> according to those findings , biden ’ s tax proposal , if enacted by congress , would amount to the fifth - largest tax increase since the 1940s — not the biggest hike in modern u . s . <MASK> .",2020-10-16 00:02:13+00:00,test_701,test,misinfo

1,"you ’ re an actor struggling to make a name for yourself in mid - 1940s hollywood . so far your only film roles have been parts in frothy , undistinguished wartime pictures such as government girl and i love a soldier , and you ’ re anxious to move up from your <MASK> as a third - tier player . <PARA> suddenly you land a starring role in an upcoming broadcast of popular and prestigious national radio program . this is it , your big break ! that is , until the star of the previous week ’ s show ( who unlike you , is a solidly established actor ), while announcing your upcoming appearance , reacts to your name with amazement and dismay that such an important role has been handed over to a virtual unknown . <PARA> such is the legend that has long been attached to the name of actor sonny tufts ( born bowen charlton tufts iii ), an erstwhile opera singer and broadway stage actor who ventured to hollywood in 1942 . tufts ’ relative good looks ( he was tall and blue - eyed ) and the manpower shortage created by world war ii enabled him to land secondary roles in a number of inconsequential wartime comedies , but he never rose above b - movie <MASK> , and his film career was effectively over by the mid - 1950s . <PARA> tufts is today primarily remembered as the subject of one of the most prominent legends of radio ’ s heyday , related thusly by leonard maltin in his book the great american broadcast : <PARA> the “ sonny tufts ” legend was primarily promulgated by syndicated newspaper columnist kermit schafer , whose popular series of “ bloopers ” records purported to present “ authentic [ bloopers ] gathered from kinescopes , sound tracks , video tapes , and other bona fide sources .” schafer ’ s presentation of the alleged incident appeared on a number of his “ bloopers ” albums , which we ’ ve captured as an mp3 file and transcribed below : <PARA> this “ blooper ” wasn ’ t a recording of any genuine radio moment , however . schafer ’ s “ bona fide sources ” were often nothing more than contributors ’ badly - flawed memories of things they thought they once heard , or apocryphal radio lore passed around by word of mouth . accordingly , his records frequently presented staged studio “ re - creations ” of events for which no recordings existed , in many cases because those events never occurred in the first place . <PARA> this recording is one such example : not only has it obviously been exaggerated for effect ( sonny tufts was strictly a bit player in the 1940s film industry ; nobody would have introduced him back then as “ hollywood ’ s newest sensation ”), but its details are flat - out wrong . <MORE> following week ’ s episode ( entitled “ the cat and mouse ”). however , as leonard maltin has noted : <PARA> a recording of that suspense episode bears maltin out on this point . joseph cotten ’ s introduction of sonny tufts at the conclusion of that episode was a perfectly straightforward one : <PARA> in retrospect , it ’ s easy to trace the arc of this legend , which wasn ’ t contemporaneous with tufts ’ early days in the movie business ( when it allegedly took place ) but only began to spread several years later , when tufts had become the subject of much public ridicule for other reasons . tufts never rose above his <MASK> as a minor actor , and by the 1950s his drinking problems had established him as far more of a hollywood joke than a hollywood star . among his reported drunken escapades were : <PARA> o 1948 : actor edward troy fractured his knee while “ riding piggyback on movie star sonny tufts ” at an arizona resort hotel . <PARA> o 1950 : tufts and three companions were arrested for public drunkenness after los angeles police spotted them “ tight - rope ” walking along white traffic lines in the middle of a street . <PARA> o 1951 : tufts ’ wife sued him for separate maintenance , <MASK> that he had been jobless for over a year and was “ dissipating their community property ” on alcohol and lavish living . three days later , tufts ( along with hawaiian actress luukiana kaeloa ) was arrested as a “ transient drunk ” after engaging in a heated argument with a night club cook over an unpaid bill for $ 4 . 55 worth of fried chicken . <PARA> o 1954 : tufts was sued by two female dancers who <MASK> he had bitten both of them on the thighs ( in separate incidents ). <PARA> o 1955 : tufts was sued by a 22 - year old woman who <MASK> the actor approached her in a restaurant , “ mauled her , then pinched her so hard she screamed .” <PARA> o 1957 : tufts and a female companion were jailed for public drunkenness after he passed out on a sunset strip sidewalk in hollywood ( and his companion then fell on top of him ), suffering a cut above his left eye which required four stitches to close . <PARA> radio was the one medium in which tufts had once essayed roles on equal footing with hollywood ’ s leading stars , and after he declined in <MASK> to little more than a hollywood punchline , one could look back with wonder that he had ever worked among such august company . from there it was a short step to retroactively creating a gag set years earlier , about a real actor ’ s supposed reaction to someone whose name would later became a joke .",2021-06-23 21:50:34+00:00,test_1363,test,misinfo

1,"in the weeks leading up to the november 2018 u . s . midterm elections , reports of voter suppression and voter fraud intensified , and a years - old meme emerged which gave the impression that the <MASK> of texas was disenfranchising women en masse : <PARA> although we received inquiries from readers about these <MASK> starting in august 2018 , the meme itself , created by the facebook page “ meme gop ,” actually first emerged in the autumn of 2013 , in the lead - up to two special <MASK> elections in texas . <PARA> the meme referenced a real voter id controversy that occurred in texas in 2012 and 2013 , but it presented some details <MASK> and significantly <MASK> the extent to which the policy in question actually impeded voters , including women , from casting their ballots . <PARA> background <PARA> in 2011 , texas <MASK> legislators passed s . b . 14 , a bill which required registered voters to show photo id at polling <MASK> . the accepted forms of id were specified as : driver ’ s license , election identification certificate , texas department of public safety personal id card , military id , u . s . citizenship certificate , u . s . passport , and a concealed handgun license . <PARA> if a voter ’ s name as shown on the photo id did not exactly match the name on the voter rolls but was “ substantially similar ” in the opinion of polling <MASK> staff , the voter could cast a ballot after signing an affidavit swearing that they were the same person listed on the voter roll : <PARA> a spokesperson for the texas secretary of <MASK> ’ s office confirmed for us that election clerks were trained to look for overlaps in information , including residential addresses and dates of birth , and treat former names ( for example names used in the course of marriage , divorce , or re - marriage ) as “ substantially similar .” <PARA> what this meant was that , in principle , even voters whose last names had changed since they registered to vote could cast full ballots ( as opposed to a provisional ballots ) without any requirement to bring additional documentation to the polling <MASK> . the only differences in their voting experiences were that they would have to sign sworn affidavits and check a box labeled “ similar name ” on their ballots . <PARA> it ’ s possible that some voters might be discouraged from voting by these requirements ( especially the requirement to sign a sworn affidavit ), or that some election clerks might not be comprehensively trained in the relevant procedures , or that a confusion or delay over names might prompt a voter who was pressed for time to give up on casting a ballot . <PARA> however , the meme was wrong in its <MASK> that the photo id <MORE> , which is well summarized here . in 2017 , the texas <MASK> legislature passed a new photo id law called s . b . 5 , which somewhat relaxed the id requirements and gained u . s . court of appeals approval in april 2018 . <PARA> a spokesperson for the secretary of <MASK> ’ s office confirmed to us that the procedures relating to “ substantially similar ” names had not changed under s . b . 5 and remained as they were under s . b . 14 . therefore , the meme ’ s <MASK> about divorce documents and birth and marriage certificates were as inaccurate about the law in october 2018 as they were in october 2013 . <PARA> the latest official guidelines for election judges and clerks in texas outline the procedures that are relevant to voters whose last names have changed since they registered to vote : <PARA> these guidelines have not changed since 2014 , when s . b . 14 was still in place . <PARA> conclusion <PARA> the 2013 meme referred to a real voter id controversy in texas and a 2011 law ( s . b . 14 ) which did create certain specific requirements for voting that could disproportionately impact women because of the tradition of hanging surnames after marriage . however , s . b . 14 did not , in 2013 , “ prevent ” women from voting outright , as the meme <MASK> . nor did a 2017 version of the photo id law ( s . b . 5 .) “ prevent ” anyone from voting outright . <PARA> rather , the photo id law ( in both its incarnations ) meant voters whose names were different on their photo ids than on the voter rolls could still cast ballots provided they signed sworn affidavits and checked a box labeled “ similar name .” <PARA> the meme made two more specific factual <MASK> . first , that a “ voter card must match [ a ] birth certificate .” this is inaccurate : texas law requires that the name on a voter ’ s photo id must be at least substantially similar to their name as listed on the voter roll . the voter ’ s birth certificate does not come into the equation . <PARA> second , the meme alleged that “ if a woman has been married , divorced and re - married then she must bring both marriage certificates and divorce documents in order to vote !” this is also <MASK> . in order to cast a ballot ( i . e . “ in order to vote ”) a voter whose last name has changed need only sign an affidavit swearing that they are the same person listed on the register , and check the box on their ballot paper marked “ similar name .” there is no requirement to present marriage certificates or divorce documents at polling <MASK> .",2018-10-23T18:44:54+00:00,train_117,train,misinfo

1,"now that it seems nearly every human activity has a computer - or internet - based equivalent ( e . g ., cybersex , e - mail , online chats ), it should probably come as no surprise that even a concept such as “ black friday ” also has a digital counterpart , one dubbed “ cyber monday .” <PARA> just as black friday ( the day after thanksgiving ) is supposedly the busiest “ brick and mortar ” shopping day of the year in the u . s ., so cyber monday ( the monday after thanksgiving ) is supposedly the busiest online shopping day of the year . but even though black friday may be the day that the largest number of consumers traipse through malls and shopping centers to look at goods , it isn ’ t really the highest - volume sales day ( in terms of dollars spent ) of the year . likewise , although cyber monday might be a day when a lot of computer users pile onto the internet to check out wares offered by online vendors , it isn ’ t the day most of them are buying stuff online . <PARA> in terms of overall online sales , cyber monday historically ranks as one of the busiest e - commerce days of the year . certainly many , many consumers ( including those who braved the black friday sales crush but didn ’ t come away with the purchases they wanted , and those who didn ’ t even try ) hit the internet that day to browse e - commerce sites , as the thanksgiving holiday has ended , thoughts have turned towards christmas , and people have returned to work ( where many of them have more solitude and better internet access than they do at home ). but although e - shoppers may do a lot of looking and browsing and comparing and even a good deal of buying on cyber monday , they aren ’ t placing nearly enough orders to make that day the year ’ s # 1 online sales day . <PARA> so where did the concept of cyber monday as the “ busiest online shopping day ” <MASK> ? as businessweek noted in 2005 , the term was something created by a retailers association as a promotional scheme : <PARA> so what ’ s up with this cyber monday idea ? a little bit of reality and a whole lot of savvy marketing . it turns out that shop . org , an association for retailers that sell online , dreamed up the term just days before putting out a nov . 21 press release touting cyber monday as “ one of the biggest online shopping days of the year .” the idea was born when a few people at the organization were brainstorming about how to promote online shopping , says shop . org executive director scott silverman . they quickly discarded suggestions such as black monday ( too much like black friday ), blue monday ( not very cheery ), and green monday ( too environmentalist ), and settled on cyber monday . “ it ’ s not the biggest day ,” silverman concedes . “ but it was an opportunity to create some consumer excitement .” <PARA> the genesis of the concept goes back even further . shop . org member shmuel gniwisch , chief executive of the online jewelry site ice . com , recalls getting an e - mail from shop . org [ in 2004 ], suggesting that online retailers come up with their own marketing hook to match black friday . “ the online guys got together and said , ‘ let ’ s give people something different ,'” he says . “ the reality is , we didn ’ t notice anything special ” on the monday after thanksgiving . <PARA> typically , the busiest “ real ” shopping day of the year occurs on the saturday before christmas , and the busiest e - shopping day takes place on a monday or tuesday a week ( or two ) before the week in which christmas falls .

1,"although many scams involve the use of telephones to contact or extract information from potential victims , a few varieties of fraud target telephone service itself as a means of obtaining ill - gotten revenue from unsuspecting prey . one common variety of telephone service fraud involves obtaining information or employing trickery that allows the scammer to place long - distance calls and bill them to someone else ( as in the #- 9 - 0 scam ), and another common variety involves duping consumers into running up hefty fees on their own telephone bills ( as in the 809 area code scam ). <PARA> in december 2005 , many uk residents were targets of the latter variety of scam , one that attempted to lure them into placing calls to a premium rate number and keep them on the line for several minutes . ( premium rate or “ pay - per - call ” numbers typically generate revenue by providing information or entertainment in exchange for a per - minute fee , which is billed to the caller ’ s phone number . such services are commonly known as “ 900 numbers “ in north america and “ 090 numbers “ in the uk , although other prefixes may be used as well .) <PARA> the bait for this scam was the distribution of official - looking postcards bearing the name “ parcel delivery services ” ( pds ) to residences , each card <MASK> that a package was awaiting delivery ( usually one said to contain a digital camera ) and that the recipient needed to call pds to obtain a “ security confirmation code ” to effect delivery of the parcel . what many consumers failed to notice ( or heed ), however , was the small print on the card informing them that the phone number provided was a premium rate number with a whopping £ 1 . 50 per - minute fee . as the bbc wales x - ray consumer investigation service found when they placed a call to the pds number : <PARA> not surprisingly , investigators failed to turn up any complainants who actually received digital cameras from pds , and phonepayplus ( formerly the independent committee for the supervision of standards of telephone information , aka icstis ), the group that oversees premium rate services in the uk , removed access to the service ( which was using up to 20 different phone numbers ) on 29 december 2005 . ( pds was run through studio telecom , a service provider registered in belize , which had previously been fined and barred by phonepayplus for using misleading direct mail promotions to generate calls to their service .) <PARA> because the internet - circulated warning did not just up and go away in december 2005 once the problem was sreolved , people continued to spread the alert in e - mail , prompting phonepayplus to add an explanation to their web site in october 2007 ( and again in updated forms in october 2009 and november 2010 ): <PARA> although the specific warning e - mail reproduced at the head of this page is out of date , it represents a common form of telephone fraud that has been used in the past and will likely be used again , so the public is well advised to be aware of it . uk telephone customers who find unexpected premium rate charges on their phone bills can obtain more information by looking up the associated phone numbers via the number checking facility on the phonepayplus web site , and they can file complaints about premium rate services through phonepayplus ’ online complaint form . u . s . residents can file complaints about premium rate services through an online form available on the web site of the federal trade commission ( ftc ).",2006-04-08T07:00:00+00:00,train_4037,train,misinfo

19 negative test in advance , nothing is ever risk - free . <PARA> paige larkin , a clinical microbiologist at northshore university healthsystem in chicago , told the new york times that , “ a negative result is a snapshot in time . it ’ s telling you that , at that exact second you are tested , the virus was not detected . it does not mean you ’ re not infected .” <PARA> los angeles county public health director barbara ferrer said , “ by the time you get a negative test result , you may no longer be negative . and even if you have no symptoms , you can easily infect others .” <PARA> people who test negative could still have the virus . the virus takes time — usually several days — to build up in a person ’ s body , so getting a test at any point also does not guarantee the virus will be fully detectable . it is possible that right before or after getting a test , people can spread the virus . <PARA> even with testing , there is still a possibility of getting a <MASK> negative result . according to one study in the annals of internal medicine , even after nine days of infection , an individual still had a 21 % chance of receiving a <MASK> negative result ( the first day of symptoms presented a 38 % chance of a <MASK> negative result ). different tests also have different success rates . the p . c . r test normally can detect the virus when it is present at low levels , but takes a few days to yield results , which means one is at risk of exposure during the time after the test . antigen tests are faster with results and more convenient , but can also miss the virus when it is less prevalent in a person ’ s body . <PARA> furthermore , relying on testing alone to determine whether it is safe to gather affords people a <MASK> sense of security . health experts recommend testing , quarantining for two weeks , wearing masks , and social distancing at gatherings to reduce the risk of spreading even more . <PARA> experts generally agree that relying solely on testing is not enough to “ clear ” a person for gatherings . in an informal survey of more than 600 epidemiologists by the new york times , just 6 % said that if they recently tested negative for the virus , they would be comfortable spending time indoors with others without precautions . some 29 % said they would do so if everyone also used masks and practiced social distancing . and 64 % said that even if they tested negative , they would not be comfortable spending time indoors with people they didn ’ t already live with . <PARA> u . s . <MASK> also have different rules surrounding travel and whether a negative test is enough to clear someone for travel between <MASK> . some <MASK> like new jersey expect travelers from specific <MASK> to voluntarily quarantine for 14 days , while new mexico requires it from travelers from high - risk <MASK> . there are even more varying rules for gatherings across different <MASK> . new york , for example , restricts all gatherings at private residences to 10 people and still requires masking for individuals in settings where they cannot maintain a 6 - foot distance from others . arkansas has a similar restriction of 10 - person gatherings with the exception of workplaces , places of worship , and certain outdoor spaces . negative test results do not impact these gathering rules . <PARA> though a negative result does reduce some risk , health experts agree that it does not guarantee one is entirely “ clear ” for gatherings . <MASK> have a range of restrictions that recommend either negative results before travel , requiring or requesting quarantining , and limiting gatherings , but all these rules do not change the relative risks described by scientific experts . since there is very little chance of one being entirely “ clear ” without a range of precautions , we rate this <MASK> as “ mostly <MASK> .”",2020-12-28 22:43:09+00:00,test_1295,test,misinfo

1,"in the summer of 2020 , snopes readers inquired about the accuracy of widely circulated facebook posts that <MASK> some ingredients in common sunscreens can be absorbed into the bloodstream and pose neurological threats to children . one <MASK> in particular was shared thousands of times . that post by a florida mother alleged that chemicals in her infant daughter ’ s sunscreen may have been connected to “ weird episodes ” of “ zoning out ” and “ dropping [ of ] her head ,” which could have led to petit mal seizures , a temporary and sudden loss of consciousness also known as absence seizures . <PARA> some elements of this <MASK> are <MASK> , while other points are either unproven or misleading . research has indicated that active ingredients found in sunscreen can be absorbed into the body ’ s bloodstream after application . however , the neurological effects of these ingredients remain poorly understood and understudied . <PARA> according to the american academy of dermatology association , consumers can choose from two types of sunscreen : chemical sunscreens that work like a sponge to absorb the sun ’ s rays , and physical sunscreens that act as a shield for the skin . physical or mineral sunscreens generally consist of titanium dioxide and zinc oxide , both of which are known for their chalky appearance when applied to the skin . chemical sunscreens , on the other hand , typically contain the chemicals oxybenzone , avobenzone , octisalate , octocrylene , homosalate , and octinoxate that reduce the white , pasty appearance . <PARA> in the united <MASK> , sunscreen is classified as an over - the - counter ( otc ) drug and is monitored and enforced by the u . s . food and drug administration ( fda ). by and large , most sunscreen products were approved before the modern , governmental standardization of drug evaluation and approval processes , requiring that drug manufacturers prove the safety and efficacy of their own products . as such , sunscreens have not been subject to rigorous drug safety testing , according to a 2014 panel held by the fda center for drug evaluation and research . <PARA> <MASK> that sunscreen can be absorbed into the body was first presented in 1997 , and subsequent research has further indicated this to be <MASK> . a study published in 2008 in coordination with the national health and nutrition examination survey — an ongoing nationwide survey to collect data on the health of americans — found that 97 % of urine samples collected as part of a national health survey contained the sunscreen ingredient oxybenzone . <PARA> the 2020 social media posts came five years after a class - action lawsuit was filed against babyganics , a skincare company that was sued for allegedly misrepresenting some of its baby products , including sunscreen , as “ natural ” and having a misleading ingredient list . according to truth <MORE> which found four active ingredients ( avobenzone , oxybenzone , octocrylene , and ecamsule ) were absorbed through the skin and into the body when sunscreen was used at its maximum dosage . <PARA> a jama editorial in response to the 2019 study co - written by dr . robert califf and dr . kanade shinkai noted that while systemic absorption was considered “ well above the fda guidelines ,” that didn ’ t necessarily mean sunscreen was unsafe . however , it does “ raise many important questions about sunscreen ” and the processes for its evaluation and approval , particularly when weighing the benefits against the risks in children . <PARA> ” ... the fact that an ingredient is absorbed through the skin and into the body does not mean that the ingredient is unsafe , nor does the fda seeking further information indicate such . rather , this finding calls for further industry testing to determine the safety and effect of systemic exposure of sunscreen ingredients , especially with chronic use ,” said dr . janet woodcock , director of the fda ’ s center for drug evaluation and research , in a <MASK> . <PARA> in short , the fda still contends that “ absorption does not equal risk ,” and the proposed rule is meant to provide “ additional safety studies to fill in the current data gaps for these ingredients .” <PARA> generally speaking , no <MASK> exists to suggest that current doses of ingredients found in common sunscreens are “ neurotoxic ” or result in epilepsy . however , a 2017 review published in the journal toxicology reports found that some adverse neurotoxic effects of chemicals used in sunscreen may occur “ at concentrations substantially higher than those observed in environment and human tissues ,” which could offer insight into such conditions in sensitive populations and potentially lend further insight into dosage recommendations . in particular , the review found potential neurotoxic effects of ingredients in both chemical and physical sunscreens , including octocrylene , zinc oxide , and titanium dioxide — three chemicals reported in the babyganics ingredients list , noted the monthly publication practical dermatology . <PARA> the research published in toxicology reports found potential links between common sunscreen ingredients and endocrinological issues , impairment of gene expression and regulation , and reproductive issues , among others . it is important to note that many of the studies included in the review analyzed the implications of environmental exposure to the chemicals in large doses on animals , both in controlled and uncontrolled environments , and did not necessarily look at the impact directly on humans at chemical levels seen in sunscreen . snopes contacted the american neurological association for further clarification and will update the <MASK> accordingly . <PARA> while the fda continues to review the short -

based mara salvatrucha , or ms - 13 , gang . of ice agents combating such crimes , trump said : “ they ’ re rough . i don ’ t want to be — say it because they ’ ll say that ’ s not politically correct . <MORE> it ’ s the difference between police intentionally shoving someone ’ s head onto the roof of a squad car or instead guiding them into the vehicle in a way that could cause injury . <PARA> additionally , trump did not explicitly say police should “ rough people up more ” during arrests , even though he did use the word “ rough ” several times in the speech to suggest what he envisions as an ideal law enforcement officer or detainment . <PARA> after the remark , amid applause and cheers from the crowd , trump turned around to address the first row of law enforcement officers behind him at the podium — some of whom were smiling . <PARA> the comments were controversial at the time , not just after floyd ’ s death in 2020 . civil and human rights activists immediately condemned their interpretation of the president ’ s remarks and the nonchalant way in which he described a scenario that could result in suspect injuries in police custody . vanita gupta , president of the leadership conference on civil and human rights , said in a <MASK> : <PARA> that backlash in 2017 also included criticism from u . s . police leaders and organizations that represent them . the chief of the houston police department , for example , tweeted : “ to be clear , inappropriate attempt at gallows humor does not reflect values of respect & commitment to constitutional policing of the profession .” <PARA> to conclude our examination , we looked at existing federal <MASK> and case law that aim to protect the civil rights of all americans in police custody , no matter what crime police think they committed , and that aim to prevent cops from using “ more force than is reasonably necessary to arrest or gain control of the victim ,” as the u . s . department of justice says on its website . if trump had told police to “ rough people up more ” during arrests , like the <MASK> asserts , without explaining under what circumstances he would like that type of excessive force used , he would have essentially been encouraging law - enforcement to break the federal law in cases where force wasn ’ t “ reasonably necessary .” <PARA> in sum , while trump did say in july 2017 that he would like to see “ thugs being thrown into the back of a paddy wagon ” and for officers not to “ be too nice ” with people in custody , and while he encouraged police to stop one procedure that aims to prevent injuries to civilians , we rate this <MASK> as “ mixture .” he did not explicitly tell police to “ rough people up more ” or to not worry about injuring suspects during arrests , though his comments could be interpreted as support for measures that could result in civilian injuries in police custody .",2020-05-29 16:48:13+00:00,test_53,test,misinfo

0,"one of the constitutional powers of the president of the united <MASK> is to nominate and appoint judges of the supreme court , with the qualification that such appointments be undertaken with the “ advice and consent of the senate .” this procedure — like many others crafted by founding fathers who did not anticipate the rise of political parties in america — has long since become enmeshed in partisan posturing . whichever party holds the white house typically seeks to elevate a supreme court nominee who is ideologically aligned with their party , employing varying strategies to push their chosen nominee through the approval process depending upon whether they , the opposition , or neither party controls the senate . <PARA> one uncommon ( but not unprecedented ) circumstance presaging a supreme court battle occurred when supreme court justice antonin scalia unexpectedly passed away on 13 february 2016 , leaving president barack obama to nominate a replacement . ( although supreme court justices are appointed for life , over the last several decades most court vacancies have been created through the retirement or resignation of sitting justices rather than death , thereby providing presidents with ample time to consider and nominate their replacements .) since at the time of antonin scalia ’ s death , president obama had less than a year remaining in his final office while the republicans held a majority of seats in the u . s . senate , the gop served notice that they could simply delay confirmation of whomever president obama nominated replace to scalia until after the upcoming presidential election in the hopes that they might regain the white house and then put forth their own nominee instead . <PARA> this chain of events , naturally , prompted criticisms about one side ’ s “ playing games ” with the supreme court confirmation process and the other side ’ s engaging in hypocrisy for objecting to something they themselves had advocated on previous occasions . this rhetorical battle was reflected in various images circulated by social media that portrayed members of both parties as opportunistic flip - floppers who justified whichever approach suited their side at the time . <PARA> one such image featured <MASK> from mitch mcconnell , the senate majority leader ( and a republican ), advocating ( in 2016 ) that scalia ’ s seat remain open until after the next presidential election , while <MASK> ( in 2001 ) that the president “ is entitled to tilt the judiciary in the direction that he feels appropriate ”: <PARA> verifying the accuracy and meaning of the first <MASK> is fairly straightforward : on 13 february 2016 ( the day scalia died ), mcconnell ’ s words were widely reported <PARA> the second <MASK> stemmed from hearings held in 2001 by a congressional subcommittee on administrative oversight and the courts regarding the judicial nomination and confirmation process ( for all federal judicial appointments , not just supreme court justices ), hearings that “ focused on the vital question of what role ideology should play in the selection and confirmation of judges .” <PARA> senator mcconnell , as a member of the committee on the judiciary , averred ( in part ) that the role of the senate should largely be to examine “ the competence and the integrity and the fitness of a judge to be on the bench ” rather than a nominee ’ s political ideology , that the senate should “ defer to the president on the question of ideology ,” that the president is “ entitled for the most part to tilt the judiciary in the direction that he feels appropriate ,” and that he ( i . e ., mcconnell ) had accordingly approved every one of judicial nominees put forth by president bill clinton ( a democrat ): <PARA> mcconnell concurred with a previous <MASK> offered by jon kyl , a republican senator from arizona , who said ( in part ): <PARA> another image featured similar “ flip - flopping ” <MASK> from senator harry reid of nevada , a democrat who previously served as senate majority leader : <PARA> as with the mcconnell image , the <MASK> attributed to reid were contradictory and presumably based on whatever course of action might be politically expedient for his party rather than on a consistent ( non - partisan ) political position . the provenance of these <MASK> was also not difficult to ascertain : on 1 march 2016 , reid was <MASK> as follows in an <MASK> about republican opposition to holding nomination hearings for scalia ’ s replacement prior to the end of president obama ’ s term : <PARA> ( technically , the constitution simply <MASK> that the president “ shall nominate , and by and with the advice and consent of the senate , shall appoint ... judges of the supreme court ”; that document is silent on whether the senate is obligated to hold hearings and vote on such nominations .) <PARA> <MASK> of sen . reid ’ s 2005 <MASK> was equally easy to come by : during a 19 may 2005 senate session convened in consideration of the appointment of priscilla owen as a judge for the fifth circuit u . s . court of appeals ( which had , among other similar nominations , been blocked by filibustering democrats ): <PARA> during those proceedings , senator reid maintained the wording of the constitution did not require that “ every nominee receive a vote ”: <PARA> a minor quibble could be made about reid ’ s speaking of judicial “ nominees ” and not supreme court “ appointees ,” but that difference seemingly had little bearing on the overall thrust of his <MASK> .",2016-03-18T07:00:00+00:00,train_2209,train,info

1,"in late 2019 , we received multiple inquiries from readers about the veracity of a viral facebook post that presented an account of the actor jimmy stewart ’ s military service during world war ii . <PARA> the post <MASK> a profound link between the trauma stewart suffered from flying 20 combat missions over germany and his ability to immerse himself in the role of george bailey , the melancholic protagonist of the classic american film ( and holiday favorite ) “ it ’ s a wonderful life .” <PARA> on dec . 22 , 2018 , ned forney — a writer who devotes his facebook page to personal histories and tributes to many u . s . military service members — posted one such account of stewart ’ s patriotism and dedication , and the emotional scars he bore from his sacrifice : <PARA> it ’ s a stirring account , and one firmly rooted in an accurate presentation of the basic sequence of events of stewart ’ s involvement in world war ii . however , elements of the <MASK> — the <MASK> that stewart was removed from flying missions over germany because he suffered from ptsd , and descriptions of him suffering nightmares of “ men falling through the air screaming ” — appear to be rather thinly sourced and not corroborated in other accounts of the actor ’ s military service . <PARA> the version of events presented in the meme appears to have borrowed heavily from a 2016 book by the nonfiction writer robert matzen , called “ mission : jimmy stewart and the fight for europe .” the book charted stewart ’ s early career as an actor , his friendships and relationships , his family ’ s <MASK> of military service , his famously close and affectionate bond with his father , and his entry into military service during world war ii . <PARA> however , the book attracted attention in the media for the revelatory <MASK> that stewart had suffered from what would now be diagnosed as ptsd , as a result of the horrors of flying 20 bombing missions over germany , to such an extent that stewart had to withdraw from combat missions , and that his trauma was visible to those on the set of “ it ’ s a wonderful life .” <PARA> here ’ s what matzen wrote in the book itself about stewart ’ s <MASK> of mind after returning to hollywood from the war : <PARA> on several occasions throughout the book , matzen described stewart as “ flak happy ,” a world war ii - era phrase for symptoms of anxiety , sleeplessness , nightmares , and so on , which would now likely be diagnosed as ptsd . in one instance , he cited an interview he conducted with lt . barry shillito , a fellow pilot and contemporary of stewart ’ s , as follows : <PARA> “... shillito was shocked at <MORE> that col . bob terrill , with whom stewart had a close affinity , might have lobbied for the transfer , but otherwise describes it as “ a routine air force change of assignment ,” adding : <PARA> “ stewart was a mature , knowledgeable and experienced air force officer with an operational and administrative background . and a stellar combat record . he knew the territory . in short , he was ready for promotion . and deserved it .” <PARA> matzen ’ s depiction of stewart ’ s <MASK> of mind as “ flak happy ” towards the end of world war ii ( a depiction reflected in forney ’ s viral facebook post ) was relatively thinly sourced , and involved only one direct <MASK> from a person who met the actor at that time . <PARA> by contrast , two other detailed accounts of stewart ’ s world war ii service make no mention of his having suffered symptoms equivalent to ptsd , nor <MASK> that such symptoms were the cause of his being gradually withdrawn from combat missions as the fighting reached its conclusion . one of those accounts was written by an air force intelligence officer who worked side - by - side with stewart between the spring of 1944 and the end of the war . <PARA> however , we don ’ t have definitive <MASK> in either direction . since “ flak happy ” is an inherently rather fuzzy description of symptoms , rather than a specific clinical diagnosis , it ’ s perfectly plausible that shillito might have seen in stewart ’ s demeanor clear signs of the condition ( an appraisal he passed on to matzen ) whereas others who encountered him might have come to a completely different conclusion , either due to their own subjective point of view , or because stewart acted differently around them . <PARA> there ’ s little doubt that much of the account presented in forney ’ s viral facebook post was accurate . stewart pushed back against bureaucratic delays and hesitation among military leadership and persistently requested to be allowed to play a more active role in the war effort , rather than being a mere “ poster boy .” while <MASK> in england , he flew and led 20 combat missions over germany , and received promotions and commendations , in particular for his leadership of those around him . naturally , he keenly felt any loss of life and later described the fear he routinely felt when embarking on bombing missions . <PARA> however , the available <MASK> is indecisive on the question of whether stewart was so acutely affected by the horrors of world war ii that he suffered nightmares , anxiety , and traumatic memories that would , today , amount to a diagnosis of ptsd . and the available <MASK> points against any such condition being the reason that he was gradually withdrawn from combat missions .",2019-12-07 00:43:25+00:00,test_754,test,misinfo

1,"<MASK> : during the reign of charles ii , who ruled in great britain and ireland during the restoration period ( 1660 - 85 ) after returning from nine years ’ exile in france , a small committee of the privy council , also known as the committee for foreign affairs ( the forerunner of the modern cabinet ), had chief management of the course of government from 1667 to 1673 . this council included the following five men : thomas clifford , 1st baron of chudleigh and lord treasurer ; henry bennet , 1st earl of arlington and secretary of <MASK> ; george villiers , <PARA> 2nd duke of buckingham ; anthony ashley cooper , 1st earl of shaftesbury and lord chancellor ; and john maitland , first duke of lauderdale and charles ’ s principal administrator in scotland . <PARA> when some of the policies of these ministers proved unpopular ( particularly their signing of the 1672 treaty of alliance with france , a catholic nation , for war against holland , a protestant nation ), this ministry was dubbed a cabal , with the negative connotations the word now carries : a junto or council of intriguers united to bring about an overturn or usurpation , particularly in public affairs . sometime later the belief arose that cabal was not merely an existing word <PARA> which had been applied to a group charles ’ ministers , but that the word itself was actually derived from the initial letters of these five men ’ s names : clifford , <PARA> arlington , buckingham , ashley , and lauderdale . <PARA> the acronymic <MASK> was merely a fanciful explanation cooked up long after the fact , however . according to the oxford english dictionary , cabal was first applied to this particular group of five ministers in a 1673 pamphlet entitled “ england ’ s appeal from the private cabal at white - hall to the great council of the nation .. . by a <MASK> lover of his country ,” and although the use of cabal to refer to charles ’ ministers may have popularized the word , it is documented as having been used in english in the same sense well before charles ii took the throne .

up to the 6 november midterm elections , especially after authorities in florida arrested 56 - year - old cesar sayoc , a supporter of president donald trump , in connection with the packages . <PARA> the mailings also engendered conspiracy theories , chief among them the notion that the sending of the suspicious packages , the contents of many of which had the appearance of pipe bombs , was a “ <MASK> flag ” operation , orchestrated by liberals to stoke outrage against president donald trump on account of his past violent rhetoric . <PARA> against this background , a viral meme emerged on 24 october which some promoters cited as <MASK> that the “ pipe bomb ” mailings were a politically - motivated hoax rather than a genuine effort to harm or intimidate perceived liberal democrats : <PARA> this message reappeared on multiple different facebook accounts , in many cases prompting comments which held that the pipe bombs were a hoax or news reports about the mail terror campaign were fake . the logic of this argument went as follows : <PARA> background <PARA> on 22 october , a suspected explosive device was found in a package in the mailbox outside the suburban new york home of george soros , a billionaire financier and philanthropist who is a frequent target of right - wing attacks and misinformation for his funding of liberal and progressive causes . <PARA> later , federal officials told the new york times that the package was likely hand - delivered rather than being sent through the mail . <PARA> two days later , the u . s . secret service intercepted two potential explosive devices which had been addressed to the <MASK> new york home of hillary and bill clinton , and the washington , d . c ., home of the obama family , respectively . in a <MASK> about those mailings , the secret service wrote : <PARA> while it ’ s <MASK> that some initial reports <MASK> that these packages had been found at or delivered to the homes , the vast majority of news <MASK> correctly stipulated that the packages had been sent to residential addresses but had been intercepted by the secret service before arrival . <PARA> so it ’ s worth noting that the misinformation the meme sought to point out was largely absent from news reports , which were overwhelmingly careful to point out , even in headlines , that the suspicious packages had never made it to the homes of the <MORE> , as a matter of policy , directly deliver mail addressed to secret service protectees . <PARA> we asked the agency to confirm this point , but a spokesperson told us : “ for operational security reasons , the secret service does not discuss specifically nor in general terms the means and methods we utilize to carry out our protective responsibilities .” <PARA> likewise , a spokesperson for usps responded to our queries by writing : “ we are not able to address your specific questions .” we also asked ups and fedex to clarify whether their employees ever directly deliver mail to secret service protectees , and a spokesperson for the former told us that “ ups has layered security measures , but we do not disclose them to maintain their effectiveness .” we did not receive a substantive response from fedex . <PARA> on 24 october , a man who identified himself as an employee of fedex and a former employee of usps called into the roger and jp show on the florida radio <MASK> whpt ( the bone ), and his contribution to the show can be heard here ( starting around the five -

1,"in 1988 , disney imagineering was searching for a lockheed electra 12a airplane like the one seen in the 1942 film casablanca . they planned to use it as part of a casablanca tableau in the great movie ride , an attraction planned for the new disney - mgm studios theme park scheduled to open in orlando the following year . <PARA> they eventually found the type of plane they were looking for in the hands of one ed walker of hondo , texas . walker not only had an electra 12a on hand , but one that had purportedly been used in several films during the 1940s ( including tarzan ’ s new york adventure ) before disappearing into an obscure career that reportedly saw it used to seed clouds over texas , owned by several different flying clubs , sold to a junior college , obtained by persons who used it for “ criminal purposes ,” and finally sold to mgm for use in a 1976 tv movie about amelia earhart , whose producers supposedly planned to blow up the plane on camera until the “ threat of a lawsuit ” ( filed by whom ?) dissuaded them from doing so . the lockheed was finally purchased by john tarsikes of devine , texas , who in turn sold it to walker , from whom disney bought it . <PARA> soon after disney acquired the plane from walker , they began trumpeting the discovery that their lockheed electra 12a wasn ’ t merely like the one used in casablanca ; according to its serial number ( 1204 ), it actually was the airplane used in casablanca ! there was one small problem with disney ’ s serendipitious <MASK> , however — no such airplane appeared in the film . <PARA> casablanca began filming just a few months after the japanese attack on pearl harbor , when military security in southern california was at its height in anticipation of another japanese attack on the aircraft manufacturing facilities and military installations found along the coast from santa barbara to san diego . location shooting by movie studios in this area was severely restricted , and filming at facilities such as airports was prohibited altogether . therefore , casablanca was shot entirely on soundstages at the warner bros . studios in burbank ; and soundstage # 1 , which was used for the film ’ s climactic airport scene , wasn ’ t large enough to accommodate a real airplane . <PARA> that final scene , in which rick blaine ( humphrey bogart ) and ilsa lund ( ingrid bergman ) say their final goodbyes as the plane to lisbon ( the one which will carry ilsa out of rick ’ s life forever ) warms up in the background is one of the most famous scenes in cinematic <MASK> , and this is the scene disney recreated in their great movie ride , for which they needed a real lockheed electra 12a . however , when warner bros . filmed the scene , they found their soundstage was too small to accommodate a real airplane , so the studio ’ s prop men constructed half - and quarter - size models of a lockheed electra 12a out of plywood and balsa . midgets garbed in jumpsuits were hired to move in and around the replica planes to camouflage their smaller - than - life scale , and the whole scene was swathed in machine - generated fog to further conceal the artificiality of the setting . ( fog certainly wasn ’ t added for any touch of realism , as foggy nights are a rarity in in casablanca .) <PARA> the one casablanca scene shot outside a sound stage did involve an airplane , but it wasn ’ t a lockheed electra 12a . major strasser ’ s arrival in casablanca was filmed at metropolitan airport in van nuys ( now known as van nuys airport ) on 10 july 1942 , after some of the wartime restrictions on location shooting had been loosened . however , according to richard e . osborne ’ s casablanca companion , the plane that carried major strasser to casablanca in that scene was a travel - air light transport plane manufactured in the late 1920s , not a lockheed . so , since disney purchased a real lockheed electra 12a , not a travel - air , and not a wooden scale model , how could they possibly have “ the ” plane actually used in the film ? the answer is , they don ’ t . but it created some great publicity for their new theme park to <MASK> that they did . <PARA> only the front part of the lockheed electra was eventually used for the great movie ride ; the back half appeared in both the studios backlot tour and the magic kingdom ’ s jungle cruise attraction . even though both disney and one of the plane ’ s former owners were careful to say that the lockheed electra “ may have been ” ( or “ probably was ”) the one actually used in the film , disney cast members at the disney - mgm studios theme park still identify it as the “ actual plane ” used in casablanca .",2001-02-24T10:07:08+00:00,train_3979,train,misinfo
1,"on 16 july 1969 , the united <MASK> of america ( through the efforts of its national aeronautics and space administration ) was poised to achieve a milestone in space exploration . that day would see the launch of the apollo 11 mission , an undertaking which would — if successful — see men set foot on a celestial body other than earth for the first time in the <MASK> of mankind , when two astronauts would land on and explore the surface of our moon . <PARA> of course , a key portion of this achievement was to be the safe return to earth of those very same astronauts , a prospect that raised a number of issues we had not confronted before . who knew what else might return to earth with the lunar explorers ? although the moon was presumed to be lifeless , we couldn ’ t rule out the possibility that bringing back equipment and samples from the lunar surface might also introduce hitherto unknown microorganisms or germs into our environment , potentially triggering a scenario like the one described by michael crichton ’ s 1969 novel the andromeda strain , in which a sample - gathering satellite returns to earth bearing deadly pathogens from space , touching off a plague that threatens to kill nearly everyone exposed to it . <PARA> to prepare for this eventuality , on the same day that apollo 11 was launched from kennedy space center , the united <MASK> adopted title 14 , section 1211 of the code of federal regulations , since known as the “ extra - terrestrial exposure law .” the purpose of title 14 , section 1211 of the cfr was not to “ make it illegal for u . s . citizens to have any contact with extraterrestrials or their vehicles ”; the law allowed the government to prevent the possibility of biological contamination from pathogens carried to earth by men and objects returning from space by enforcing a quarantine on any people , plant or animal life , or other material that had “ touched directly or come within the atmospheric envelope of any other celestial body .” <PARA> in other words , if you were an astronaut returning from a mission to the surface of the moon ( or any other celestial body ), the government could require you to undergo a quarantine ; if you did not travel into space yourself but had indirect “ extraterrestrial exposure ” through contact with returning astronauts , their space capsules , or any samples or other material brought back from the surface ( or atmosphere ) of another celestial body , the government could require you to undergo a quarantine . enforcement of the law was provided for by penalties calling for a fine of up to $ 5 , 000 or a term of imprisonment of up to one year for those who “ disregarded of the quarantine rules or regulations or without permission of the nasa quarantine officer .” <PARA> note that title 14 , section 1211 did not make it “ illegal ” for “ u . s . citizens to have any contact with extraterrestrials or their vehicles ”; it simply required those who had such contact to submit to a quarantine at the request of the government . if a spaceship full of little green men landed in your back yard , you would not have been in violation of title 14 , section 1211 and subject to a fine or imprisonment merely for shaking hands with your visitors or taking a tour of their spacecraft — you would only have been subject to those penalties if you refused to comply with a subsequent government quarantine order . ( even then , the law only applied to “ nasa manned and unmanned space missions ,” so contact with extraterrestrials who were traveled through space on their own would not have fallen under the provisions of this law .) <PARA> the “ extraterrestrial exposure ” law was removed from the cfr in 1991 , nasa having determined that it had “ served its purpose ” and was “ no longer in keeping with current policy .” that law is therefore no longer in force .",2002-02-01T08:00:00+00:00,train_5236,train,misinfo

minute video was recorded on 21 march at a public information evening for parents in the brea , california , school district , on the subject of the healthy youth act . the full video can be watched here . <PARA> california lawmakers passed the healthy youth act , as we have outlined previously , in 2015 , creating a new k - 12 , sex - education curriculum that remained in place as of april 2019 . <PARA> the law requires school districts across california to implement instruction for students related to reproductive health , sex education , personal safety , prevention of hiv and other sexually transmitted infections , child and adolescent growth , as well as programming on relationships , families , gender identity and sexual orientation . <PARA> each school district must devise its own curriculum , including specific reading materials and classroom presentations , provided the content is in keeping with the requirements of the healthy youth act , including the requirement that all instructional material must be “ age - appropriate .” <PARA> on the subject of sexual orientation , the text of the legislation <MASK> : “ instruction and materials shall affirmatively recognize that people have different sexual orientations and , when discussing or providing examples of relationships and couples , shall be inclusive of same - sex relationships .” the legislation does not mention pedophilia ( sexual activity between an adult and child ) or pederasty ( sexual activity between a man and a boy ). <PARA> the full 43 - minute video shows a 21 march presentation given by brea olinda unified school district ( bousd ) assistant superintendent kerrie torres , which provided attending parents with information about how the district was implementing the requirements of the healthy youth act , and what the bousd curriculum entailed . <PARA> around 25 minutes into the video , yates interrupted torres ’ presentation to ask about the curriculum ’ s component on sexual orientation , and whether parents could withdraw their children from it ( a subject we have previously examined in greater detail ). yates said : <PARA> “... i ’ m just wondering , because you did give me this powerpoint presentation that actually goes through the <MASK> of the lgbtiq [ lesbian , gay , bisexual <MORE> any reference to pederasty . however , an earlier version contained the following bullet point : <PARA> “ the practice of pederasty ( an older upper class man would make a young free boy his partner and become his mentor ) is mentioned in homer ’ s iliad [ the ancient greek epic poem ], and is <MASK> to have existed at least 4500 years ago in ancient egypt .” <PARA> in a <MASK> , a spokesperson for the school district told us that the previous reference to pederasty was removed from section 4 . 8 of the ninth - grade , health - education curriculum in the fall of 2018 . “ after careful review of the curriculum , the district determined it [ the bullet point ] posed more questions than answers ,” the spokesperson wrote . <PARA> the description of pederasty in the <MASK> bousd presentation is accurate , and in tracing the <MASK> of same - sex relationships in various societies , it would be perfectly relevant to mention the ancient greek custom whereby older men imposed a sexual relationship on much younger males , typically teenage boys . <PARA> although modern - day observers would view such a practice as predatory , abusive and criminal , it was widely practiced and accepted in ancient greek society . as such , it would appear relevant for inclusion in a brief summary of prominent milestones and trends in lgbt <MASK> , while bearing in mind the clear distinction between same - sex relationships , as such , and child sexual abuse . yates did not make that distinction when she confronted torres for allegedly ‘ normalizing anal sex ’ and ‘ teaching pedophilia ,’ suggesting a moral equivalence existed between consensual , same - sex sexual relations and child sexual abuse . <PARA> the bousd presentation , which is outdated anyway , did not endorse pederasty or present it approvingly , nor did it describe pederasty or pedophilia as a discrete sexual orientation . <PARA> similarly , bousd official torres did not <MASK> , in her videotaped exchange with yates , that pederasty was its own sexual orientation , or that bousd endorsed or approved of pederasty or pedophilia or taught students that sexual activity between men and boys was acceptable in any way . <PARA> thus freedom project author alex newman was inaccurate in <MASK> , during a widely shared facebook video , that torres had said of pedophilia “ this is a sexual orientation .” in reality , she said no such thing . <PARA> in fact , after concerns were raised at an earlier public meeting on 21 march , torres added a slide to her presentation for that evening that explicitly <MASK> “ we do not teach pedophilia .” <PARA> taking the foregoing facts into account , we issue a rating of “ <MASK> ” for the <MASK> that brea olinda unified school district was “ teaching pedophilia as a sexual orientation .”",2019-04-29T18:14:25+00:00,train_7417,train,misinfo

1,"on 10 may 2019 , the u . s . department of justice ( doj ) unsealed an indictment charging two men , american entertainer prakazrel “ pras ” michel and malaysian financier low taek jho ( aka “ jho low ”), with conspiring to make and conceal foreign campaign contributions in the 2012 u . s . presidential election . <PARA> u . s . law prohibits foreign nationals from contributing to federal , <MASK> , or local election campaigns . it also prohibits donors from making campaign contributions in anyone else ’ s name . the defendants stand accused of conspiring to do both , as well as making <MASK> <MASK> to the federal election commission ( fec ). <PARA> a doj press release enumerated the charges : <PARA> although the recipient ( s ) of the illegal contributions weren ’ t named in the indictment , it was clear from the context that they were campaign committees working on behalf of the re - election of president barack obama ( referred to in the document as “ candidate a ”). the object of the conspiracy , according to the doj , was “ to gain access to , and potential influence with , candidate a and his administration .” <PARA> mainstream news media coverage of the indictment focused on the alleged conspirators and the details of their plot to defraud the obama campaign and the fec . despite the fact that no one in the campaign was implicated in the conspiracy or charged with crimes , a decidedly different narrative emerged on an assortment of right - leaning , pro - trump websites and social media accounts . an 11 may 2019 <MASK> on intellihub . com , for example , bore the headline “ how barack obama received $ 21 . 6m in illegally funneled foreign campaign contributions and stole the presidency .” <PARA> “ according to reports circulating at the highest levels in washington ,” the <MASK> said , “ former u . s . president barack h . obama ’ s political campaign received at least $ 21 . 6 million in illegal foreign campaign contributions during the run - up to the 2012 presidential election .” <PARA> the sentence was subsequently <MASK> in an editorial published on at least a half - dozen other hyperpartisan blogs and websites with headlines <MASK> <MASK> that a “ media blackout ” was in place regarding the indictment . a significant chunk of the editorial was devoted to the text of what was described as “ the doj report , in full ” — although , in point of fact , what was referenced was only the doj press release , which distilled the 20 - page document down to just a few paragraphs . the author of the piece then posed ( and presumed to answer ) these rhetorical questions : <PARA> the same propagandistic strategy was employed by pro - trump social media users . <MORE> the actual amount funneled to the campaign totaled approximately $ 1 . 87 million : <PARA> “ to facilitate the excessive contributions and conceal their <MASK> source , michel paid approximately $ 865 , 000 of the money received from low to about 20 straw donors , or conduits , so that the straw donors could make donations in their names to a presidential joint fundraising committee . in addition , michel personally directed more than $ 1 million of the money received from low to an independent expenditure committee also involved in the presidential election in 2012 .” ( doj press release ) <PARA> second , as we <MASK> before , nowhere in the indictment was obama or any entity involved in the campaign implicated in the conspiracy or charged with a crime . the indictment <MASK> multiple times that the defendants went to elaborate lengths to hide what they were doing , not only from the fec but from the campaign itself . committees connected with the campaign unknowingly accepted the foreign donations via a series of shell bank accounts and straw donors set up by michel and jho to disguise the <MASK> source of the funds . <PARA> page 2 of the indictment <MASK> : <PARA> “ the defendants concealed the scheme from the candidate , the candidate ’ s campaign and administration , federal regulators , and the public by secretly funneling foreign money from jho low through a series of straw donors ( also known as “ conduits ” or “ straw contributors ”) who purported to make legal campaign contributions in their own names , rather than in the names of the <MASK> source of the funds . michel concealed the conspiracy by making and causing <MASK> <MASK> to be made to the fec . ” <PARA> page 8 of the indictment <MASK> : <PARA> “ michel , company e , and the straw donors made contributions to political committees a and b in their own names , rather than the name of jho low , thus concealing the <MASK> source of the contributions . as a result , michel caused political committees a and b to make <MASK> entries in multiple campaign contribution reports submitted to the fec about the <MASK> source of the contributions . to further conceal the <MASK> source of the contributions , and to maintain his appearance as a high dollar fundraiser for candidate a , michel made <MASK> entries in a declaration he submitted to the fec <MASK> that he was the source of the contributions to political committee b .” <PARA> last , the supposition that these illegal contributions enabled obama to win ( or “ steal ”) the election is absurd , considering that the campaign raised ( and spent ) roughly $ 722 million in total , of which the actual donations jho and michel managed to funnel to the committees amounted to about one -

1,"in july 2020 , some social media users accused the furniture store wayfair of trafficking children . this gravely serious accusation was not based on police reports , firsthand accounts , financial records , or deep investigative reporting . rather , it was based on the fact that some items on wayfair were listed at exorbitant prices compared to other , similar items . <PARA> this <MASK> appears to have <MASK> on the “ conspiracy ” section of reddit on july 9 , 2020 . that post noted that wayfair was selling utility closets from wfx that were priced at more than $ 10 , 000 , and offered child trafficking as a possible explanation . that post , like so many other conspiracy theories , offered this notion as a mere possibility and said that it would be stomach churning “ if ... <MASK> .” <PARA> this post led to other users combing the wayfair website in search of other oddities . one twitter user , for instance , found a set of pillows and shower curtains that were listed for $ 9 , 999 . as similar items on the website were listed for only $ 99 , this person assumed that the only logical explanation was that the higher priced item was being used to traffic children . <PARA> generally speaking , the images showing expensive cabinets and large price differentials on pillows , shower curtains , and other items on wayfair ’ s website are real . however , it takes quite a leap in logic to arrive at the conclusion that this is <MASK> that the store is engaged in child trafficking . <PARA> in fact , the more we pondered this <MASK> , the more nonsensical it appeared . would a large business really use their official website to allow people to purchase children online ? as these items are available to anyone with internet access , wouldn ’ t it be possible for someone to accidentally become involved in child trafficking ? why would a child trafficking operation use a method that would be so easy to track ? <PARA> this <MASK> is largely based on the idea that $ 10 , 000 is simply too expensive for a cabinet , and that there has to be some other explanation — child trafficking — to justify its cost . in a <MASK> to newsweek , however , wayfair noted that these were industrial grade cabinets , and that they had been accurately priced . wayfair said that they temporarily removed these items , as the accompanying descriptions did not accurately explain the reason for the price point . <PARA> wayfair told newsweek in a <MASK> : <PARA> we reached out to wayfair for more information about the expensive pillows and shower curtains , but have yet to receive a response . <PARA> as this <MASK> circulated on social media , people chimed in with additional “ <MASK> ” of wayfair ’ s supposedly <MORE> <MASK> that these products carried the names of children who had gone missing . one cabinet , for instance , appeared on wayfair as the “ anabel 5 - shelf storage unit .” this , according to proponents of this theory , corresponded with an anabel wilson who had gone missing in kansas . while this may seem suspicious to those seeking a pattern , it should be noted that there were more than 400 , 000 entries for missing juveniles in the fbi ’ s national crime information center in 2019 . in other words , the fact that some of these product names were the same as the first names of children who had gone missing could easily be nothing more than a coincidence . <PARA> furthermore , some of the missing children cases this theory attempted to connect to wayfair have already been solved . the “ alyvia ” shelf , for example , was supposedly connected to alyvia navarro . this autistic child went missing at the age of 3 in 2013 and , unfortunately , was found dead shortly after she went missing , having drowned in a nearby pond . <PARA> on july 13 , 2020 , proponents of this theory started sharing a mugshot of a man in a wayfair shirt and <MASK> that he had recently been arrested as part of a trafficking ring . <PARA> this is a genuine photograph of fredrick walker jr . who was arrested on june 21 , 2020 , during a prostitution sting in barnesville , georgia . however , those sharing this image as “ <MASK> ” of this wayfair conspiracy theory failed to mention that this person was just one of nearly two dozen people who were arrested during this sting , that none of the other people arrested were wearing wayfair shirts , that news reports about the arrest made no mention about any connection to the store , and that there ’ s no <MASK> that the victims in this case were children . <PARA> the <MASK> that wayfair is trafficking children is based almost entirely on one person ’ s confusion over an expensive cabinet . this conspiracy theory , like so many conspiracy theories , started with a wild and unfounded assumption that would be sickening if it were actually <MASK> . as of this writing , absolutely no credible <MASK> has been offered to back up this accusation . <PARA> but the conspiracy theory did have real impact . according to a july 20 press release from polaris , its national human trafficking hotline ( 1 - 888 - 373 - 7888 ) received such an “ extreme volume ” of reports related to this <MASK> ( none of which contained information beyond what was already reported online ) that it struggled to respond to other calls from people potentially in need . the <MASK> encouraged callers to learn more about “ what human trafficking really looks like .”",2020-07-10 20:34:26+00:00,test_271,test,misinfo

1,"on october 27 , 2016 , the results of a large - scale , global study on the safety and efficacy of an injectable , hormone - based form of birth control for men was released ahead of publication in the journal of clinical endocrinology & metabolism . <PARA> this study was the first large scale test of a specific injectable combination of hormones , but research into this form of male birth control , which slows or blocks a man ’ s ability to produce sperm , has been puttering along for decades . <PARA> this specific study was a phase ii trial , the middle step in the three - study process that drugs must go through to be approved . according to a press release from conrad , one of the groups that helped facilitate the study , the method was effective but came with some side effects : <PARA> according to the study , the method boasted a 96 percent success rate for the 320 men ( and their non - pregnant partners ) involved in the study , but “ the frequencies of mild to moderate mood disorders were relatively high .” <PARA> the decision to halt the study came from the independent data safety and monitoring committee established by both conrad and the world health organization ’ s department of reproductive health and research , as described in the study : <PARA> this conclusion led a number of media outlets to attach a narrative to the study suggesting that the trial was cancelled because the men didn ’ t think the side effects were worth it , despite the fact that an international board of scientists made that call . this narrative is best summarized by cosmopolitan magazine ’ s choice of headline / subtitle combo to announce the news of the study : <PARA> this narrative is rooted in the undeniable gender disparity in the world of contraceptive medicine : that the only hormone - based birth control available must be taken by women , despite the fact that many of these drugs have adverse effects similar to the ones that canceled the study into male hormonal birth control . <PARA> some reports have capitalized on this clear irony to suggest that regulatory agencies such as the fda or who have a different level of tolerance for adverse effects based on gender . that assertion , in this specific case , is a challenging one to make , as the approval process that led to the adoption of female hormonal contraception ( the pill ) in the 1960s was very different beast than the approval process in place today . <PARA> the <MASK> pill was approved for use as a contraceptive in 1960 , before a sweeping 1961 overhaul of the fda ’ s drug approval process ( inspired by a worldwide disaster attributed to a poorly vetted drug ) led to tighter regulation of drug trials . the number of women included in the trials , as well as the length of time they were studied , has led many to criticize the pill ’ s <MASK> approval as hasty . the number of people included in that trial ( or in the recent male trial ), for example , would not have been enough to win its approval by today ’ s fda . <PARA> and , indeed , health risks associated with the pill ( most notably blood clots ) appeared in the following decades , leading drug manufacturers to lower doses and experiment with different administration schedules and mechanisms . a study published in 2016 has also pointed to potential long term effects related to mood disorders tied to long - term use of the pill . <PARA> the question of whether or not the pill , as presented to the fda in 1960 , would have been approved today is just as valid as the question of how this male contraceptive would have fared in the fda of the 1960s . unfortunately , the two studies are rooted in very different histories and scientific climates . it is also hard to compare numbers from a brief trial to those obtained over decades of studying a drug after its approval . <PARA> the final <MASK> presented in viral stories about this study is that research , because of these side effects , has been halted . in fact , researchers have not “ given up ” on research into male hormonal birth control , and scientists have hailed the work as a great breakthrough , as reported in new scientist : <PARA> because this study was a phase ii trial , its full completion would not have resulted in a new product anyway . the scientists themselves are also optimistic about the future , <MASK> in the conrad press release that future research will seek to find the right combination of hormones to provide the same results with fewer side effects : <PARA> a majority of participants in the study also expressed interest in further development of the drug , according to the researchers : <PARA> the irony that a male contraceptive trial was halted due to side effects commonly seen in female hormonal contraception was — for good reason — not lost on the internet . however , using this study as an example of male disinterest in bridging the contraceptive burden disparity between genders brushes over one of the best breakthroughs yet at dismantling that disparity .",2016-11-01T02:10:48+00:00,train_7614,train,misinfo

experts say no . <PARA> “ there is no fair comparison ,” said dr . ruth blue , secretary to the board of trustees of the thalidomide society , in an email to snopes . <PARA> while it is <MASK> that thalidomide was marketed in some countries in 1957 to treat nausea and insomnia in pregnant women , and withdrawn five years later due to malformations in newborns , thalidomide was an often daily therapeutic drug aimed at treating symptoms and not an immunization to prevent viral infections and spread . <PARA> “ thalidomide was developed in the late 1950s and early 1960s and was prescribed to pregnant women to ease morning sickness , anxiety , insomnia , and a host of other complaints . it had not been properly tested in already and non - pregnant women [ and ] there were troubling side effects of the drug ,” blue said . “ vaccines are tried and tested science , they do not work the same way that thalidomide did .” <PARA> furthermore , thalidomide was not approved in the u . s . until decades after the tragedy , and only after healthcare experts studied the long - term safety and efficacy effects of the therapeutic . ironically , <MORE> issued two emergency use authorizations ( eua ) for covid - 19 vaccines developed by pfizer - biontech and moderna in response to the covid - 19 pandemic . <PARA> even so , the agency noted in a dec . 18 <MASK> that a eua does not constitute approval : <PARA> as such , the fda expects vaccine distributors authorized under a eua to continue clinical trials to obtain additional safety and effectiveness information and pursue eventual approval . <PARA> ironically , the thalidomide tragedy marked a turning point in toxicity testing , prompting regulatory agencies to more closely examine systematic pharmaceutical testing for long - term safety and efficacy both in the prescribed patient and unborn fetuses . <PARA> thalidomide was not necessarily a “ fast - tracked ” drug as many of the social media posts <MASK> . the oral tablet was not trialed at the magnitude modern pharmaceuticals and therapies are tested , and its long - term safety and efficacy were not tracked in large human populations until it was too late . <PARA> like vaccinations , fda approval of a drug also requires four phases and a series of clinical trials to determine whether it is safe and effective at its prescribed use . phase 1 typically emphasizes safety and will monitor between 20 and 80 patients — a very small sample size — to determine the drug ’ s most frequent side effects and how the drug is metabolized and excreted . <PARA> in the second phase , researchers will test hundreds of patients in often controlled trials to determine the effectiveness with the goal of obtaining preliminary data on whether the drugs work in people with certain conditions or diseases . <PARA> following phase 2 , the fda will determine how large - scale studies will be conducted in phase 3 , at which point thousands of patients will be given the drug for data collection at a much larger scale . <PARA> approval then requires a number of steps that could take place over several months . once a drug is approved , phase 4 entails a post - marketing risk assessment that requires the fda to continue to monitor and evaluate safety updates . <PARA> standard review typically takes around 10 months whereas priority review takes around six , according to the fda . <PARA> because of these protocols , treatment protocols for thalidomide usage in 2020 are strict in determining whether a patient is pregnant at the time of taking the drug . <PARA> as of this writing , thalidomide is regulated by the system for thalidomide education and prescribing safety ( steps ) program , which aims to educate patients who receive the drug about potential risks . among other measures , women who could become pregnant must agree to undergo pregnancy testing before starting the medication , and continue to do so during the course of their therapy to prevent the risk of fetal exposure to thalidomide .",2020-12-22 22:26:51+00:00,test_1251,test,misinfo

1,"<MASK> : when one talks of going “ cold turkey ,” such announcement is immediately grasped as meaning complete cessation of a particular activity .

( and yes , it is possible these days to buy sliced turkey at the deli counter , thereby obviating the need to roast a bird , but that option came into play long after the first linguistic uses of the term .) <PARA> second , there ’ s the suggestion that the skin of an addict enduring the pangs of withdrawal resembles that of a plucked but uncooked turkey . while that may or may not be the case , the earliest recorded uses of the phrase “ cold turkey ” had nothing to do with addicts , addiction or quitting something abruptly , therefore that explanation fails to supply a valid answer to the <MASK> of the phrase . <PARA> the earliest recorded print sighting of “ cold turkey ” dates to 1910 and is found in robert service ’ s the trail of ’ 98 : “ once i used to gamble an ’ drink the limit . one morning i got up from the card - table after sitting there thirty - six hours . i ’ d lost five thousand dollars . i knew they ’ d handed me out “ cold turkey ,” but i took my medicine .” per that usage , “ cold turkey ” refers to having been cheated at cards . the “ cold ” aspect of that use continues to this day ( a deck of cards which has been stacked in such fashion that a con ’ s mark can ’ t win against it is termed a “ cold deck ”). <PARA> the phrase began to reflect a meaning of abruptly quitting an addictive substance about a decade later , as this print sighting from 1921 shows : “ perhaps the most pitiful figures who have appeared before dr . carleton simon ... are those who voluntarily surrender themselves . when they go before him , they [ drug addicts ] are given what is called the ‘ cold turkey ’ treatment . <PARA> the most likely source for “ cold turkey ” stems from the earlier idiom “ talk turkey .” to “ talk turkey ” ( earliest sighting 1824 ) was to speak affably , in pleasant terms . over time , that meaning shifted into one of speaking plainly and directly about a particular matter , as this 1903 sighting shows : “ i ’ m going to talk turkey with him and see if i can ’ t get him to mend his ways .” that use continues in common parlance , in that one seeking a raise might well during a sit down with the boss say “ it ’ s time to talk turkey .” <PARA> “ talk turkey ” went on to produce the variant “ talk cold turkey ,” which meant to lay out hard facts and / or get immediately down to business , as this 1928 sighting demonstrates : “ she talked cold turkey about sex . ‘ cold turkey ’ means plain truth in america .” <PARA> “ cold turkey ” ( in the sense of ending a particular addiction ) appears therefore to be a shortening of “ talk cold turkey ,” in that one who chooses to abruptly and decisively quit engaging in a harmful behavior isn ’ t merely talking cold turkey but rather living it . <PARA> barbara “ cold truth ” mikkelson",-0001-11-30T00:00:00+00:00,train_3471,train,misinfo

born ( i . e ., immigrant ) soldiers fighting on the union side alone , so a significant number of civil war deaths might have involved non - american citizen combatants , but we ’ ll count them all as “ americans .” ( indeed , non -

combatant deaths ( the latter being figures which might also include non - u . s . citizens ). one could argue that civilian deaths in wars should be included ( although estimates of these deaths are much less reliable than for fatalities among military personnel ), but we are limiting our analysis to include only combatant deaths in military conflicts . <PARA> we ’ ll break this analysis into two parts : the total number of deaths in the united <MASK> involving firearms since 1968 , and the number of deaths in the u . s . and among american combatants across all wars in american <MASK> . <PARA> gun deaths <PARA> the estimated total number of firearms -

point in this estimate range assumes about 750 , 000 combatant deaths for the civil war . because of the enhanced <MASK> sophistication involved in hacker ’ s research , and what appears to be acceptance and support of his estimate among historians , we are going to use 750 , 000 as the estimated death toll among combatants in the civil war . <PARA> figures for the global war on terror are taken from the department of defense ’ s defense casualty analysis system and are valid as of october 2017 . <PARA> afghanistan war : <PARA> iraq war : <PARA> if we rely on the department of veterans affairs summary , while accepting j . david hacker ’ s 750 , 000 estimate for the civil war , the total number of deaths among american combatants in all u . s . military conflicts , using high estimates for each , is thus 1 , 481 , 862 — about 100 , 000 less than the total number of firearms -

<PARA> first , to explore that question , we researched the circumstances under which the trump administration was most likely to have written the alleged document . we learned via a july 1 , 2020 , hud press release carson had recently written a proposal to amend existing guidelines that govern how federally funded homeless shelters operate , and we deemed that initiative to be the most likely source of the <MASK> ’ s inspiration . the press release <MASK> : <PARA> some context : housing officials under former u . s . president barack obama <MASK> established the equal access rule , which requires homeless shelters and other facilities that receive money through the hud ’ s office of community planning and development to give americans equal access to services , regardless of their gender identity or other characteristics . <PARA> carson ’ s proposal primarily targeted homeless shelters and facilities within that group that keep beds , bathrooms or other spaces separate for men and women for both emergency and longer - term stays . his measure would have given those places the legal authority to establish rules so only people whose biological sex corresponds with that of what the shelter serves would be granted access to services , no matter how people identify . <PARA> next , we obtained the memo to which the lgbtq nation headline and press release were referring : a 29 - page document on hud ’ s official website titled “ making admission or placement determinations based on sex in facilities under community planning and development housing programs .” the docket was signed by carson , a former neurosurgeon whom trump appointed to lead hud in 2016 . <PARA> the in - question measure would have changed existing guidelines that , the document alleged , obama ’ s administration enacted in violation of administrative law and “ minimized local control , burdened religious organizations , manifested privacy issues , and imposed regulatory burdens .” the proposal read : <PARA> at one point , the document implied that the existing equal access rule — requiring facilities nationwide to provide housing , regardless of incoming residents ’ gender identities — posed a danger to shelter residents ; an argument that appeared to be rooted in the unsubstantiated and transphobic <MASK> that men with nefarious intentions might pose as trans women and gain access to female facilities to stalk or harass women . however , the document did not explain how or under what circumstances hud came to that assumption , nor did it provide verifiable instances of that happening , aside from a pending lawsuit in fresno , california , that alleges a shelter there allowed such behavior . the hud proposal <MASK> : <PARA> pending whatever shelters decide for their entry policies under the proposal , the document <MASK> , staff at facilities that are designed to exclusively serve men or women would ask incoming residents their gender identities before giving them beds . in those cases , if intake workers had “ good faith ” to believe someone was presenting as male or female but that gender did not correspond with their birth sex — which is literally the definition of being transgender — and that birth sex was not served by the shelter , the staff could turn them away . <PARA> it was at that point in the docket hud wrote : <PARA> in sum , it is accurate to <MASK> that under the leadership of trump , hud issued a memo in july 2020 that outlined steps for staff at federally funded homeless shelters to determine whether or not incoming residents were transgender , and given the language — it listed masculine physical features and how to notice them , presumably in circumstances when trans women are seeking housing at female - only shelters — we rate this <MASK> “ <MASK> .” <PARA> however , this fact was key : the measure regarding homeless shelters ’ entry guidelines never took hold at facilities . <PARA> federal leaders were still debating the proposal at the time of the november 2020 election . and after voters elected democratic candidate joe biden over trump , biden ’ s hud secretary , marcia fudge , withdrew the trump - era measure from consideration . fudge said in an april 2021 <MASK> :",2020-07-24 16:40:56+00:00,test_349,test,info

1,"haiti ’ s relationship with the united <MASK> and europe can most charitably be described as complicated . haiti ’ s earliest days were characterized by oppression and opposition : the country ( once the french colony of st . domingue ) was born from a successful slave insurgency and declared its independence in 1804 . this beginning characterized an often - antagonistic relationship between countries that profited handsomely from african slavery ( such as the united <MASK> ) and haiti . foremost among fears about haiti was that slaves would learn successful uprisings were possible . <PARA> after haiti formally declared its independence , the united <MASK> suspended all diplomatic and trade relationships with the country . while the u . s . eventually re - opened trading routes , america didn ’ t recognize haiti diplomatically for nearly sixty years after that . other countries followed the united <MASK> ’ example ( and france demanded millions of francs in reparations for its rebellion in exchange for recognizing haiti as a sovereign nation ) plunging haiti into debt and an economic depression that lasted for years , from which the country never fully recovered . <PARA> multiple invasions and economic and political tinkering followed , leaving haiti in a turmoil of political instability and corruption , economic crisis , and a ravaged infrastructure , historically one of the poorest countries in the western hemisphere , despite its fertile land and ability to grow cash crops such as sugar . <PARA> today , child labor and trafficking are endemic in haiti , particularly in the country ’ s manufacturing sector , which is outsourced to foreign companies ( many of them contractors for american companies , such as hanes , dockers , and fruit of the loom ). even when they are not trafficked , laborers in haiti ’ s garment industry earn a pittance by the standards of other countries : the minimum wage was $ 0 . 24 ( usd ) an hour for many years . <PARA> in june 2009 , the haitian parliament unanimously passed a law requiring that the minimum wage be raised to $ 0 . 61 an hour , or $ 5 a day . ( the average cost of living is estimated to be the equivalent of about $ 23 a day .) this pay raise was staunchly opposed by foreign manufacturers who had set up shop in the country , and the united <MASK> department of <MASK> and the u . s . agency for international development backed those manufacturers . after haiti ’ s government mandated the raise , the united <MASK> aggressively ( and successfully ) pushed haiti ’ s president to lower the minimum wage for garment workers to what factory owners were willing to pay : the equivalent of about $ 0 . 31 an hour ( or $ 2 . 50 per eight - hour day ). <PARA> in 2011 , wikileaks released a set of previously - secret diplomatic cables . the american publication the nation partnered with haitian news organization haïti liberté to cover them , finding ( among other things ) how strongly the united <MASK> had opposed the minimum wage hike : <PARA> the obama administration ( and the bush administration before it ) had been closely monitoring the situation in the garment manufacturing sector for a long time . in 2006 , congress passed the hope bill ( which stood for the haitian hemispheric opportunity through partnership encouragement ) and provided duty - free entry to garments manufactured in haiti for u . s . companies . that body also passed an updated version of the bill ( hope ii ) in 2008 , which mandated a framework for labor reform in factories . according to cables released by wikileaks , it was exactly these efforts that the united <MASK> <MASK> would be jeopardized by a higher minimum wage . <PARA> so it ’ s <MASK> that the <MASK> department ( then led by hillary clinton as secretary of <MASK> ) strongly opposed a minimum wage increase in haiti in 2009 . however , the <MASK> department ’ s efforts did not occur in a political or economic vacuum , and clinton wasn ’ t the sole architect of efforts to quash a minimum wage hike ( as the meme suggests ). it was a concerted effort on the part of haitian elites , factory owners , free trade proponents , u . s . politicians , economists , and american companies that kept the minimum wage so low , and to lay the blame squarely at the feet of any sitting secretary of <MASK> would be an incomplete assessment , and thus inaccurate . <PARA> a law establishing a new minimum wage of $ 5 . 11 per workday ($ 0 . 64 an hour ) was finally approved in 2014 , which still fell far short of both the demanded raise by workers ( to the equivalent of $ 11 . 36 per workday , or $ 1 . 42 per hour ) and the recommended daily wage of 1 , 006 haitian gourdes , or usd $ 22 . 86 . <PARA> related <MASK> of the clintons ’ relationship to haiti appeared in october 2016 , this time alleging that after the haiti ’ s infrastructure was <MASK> by a major earthquake in 2010 , the <MASK> department steered relief contracts to personal friends of the clintons . however , while hillary clinton did recommend specific companies to help with the rebuilding process and e - mails have surfaced indicating that special attention was given to “ fobs ” (“ friends of bill ”), there ’ s no <MASK> that the united <MASK> government awarded contracts to any of those contenders .",2016-04-05T19:05:11+00:00,train_1285,train,misinfo

long campaign strategy to downplay the seriousness of the covid - 19 pandemic . <PARA> at rallies and on twitter , trump repeated <MASK> that alleged a nefarious scheme on behalf of news reporters to undermine his reelection campaign by highlighting covid - 19 <MASK> — when , in trump ’ s reality , he wanted americans to believe the country was “ rounding the turn ” on the deadly outbreak . <PARA> by pointing to alleged successes , ranging from the country ’ s mortality rate to its testing levels , trump sought to convince americans his administration was making positive strides in curbing the virus ’ spread , and that the worse of the outbreak was over . with that messaging , he attempted to frame his democratic rival joe biden as the candidate who would instead ruin the economy with strict lockdowns to curb the spread . on oct . 30 , trump tweeted : <PARA> “ biden would lock us down forever . we are rounding the corner !” <PARA> below , we determined the legitimacy of trump ’ s framing of the covid - 19 outbreak in the run - up before election day . we considered key metrics to which scientists point for measuring the outbreak ’ s <MASK> : the rolling average in the increase in new cases and deaths each day , and mortality rates . <PARA> we based our analysis on covid - 19 patient information compiled by multiple sources , including the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) and the covid tracking project , to which local governments and health care systems refer , as of oct . 30 . <PARA> first , let let us define what a wave means during outbreaks of infectious diseases . when a fatal epidemic starts , a rising number of people fall ill and die , and that number grows until some sort of change occurs . <PARA> for example , as researchers deepen their understanding of a new disease , they can tell communities how to better protect themselves from illness — and those messages could stop rising case numbers and fatalities . or , a disease may become less transmissible over time , people may grow immune , or scientists may discover <MORE> the above - explained trends : <PARA> but that data did not include the rolling average of new covid - 19 cases on a <MASK> - by - <MASK> basis — rather than nationally — which was among the strongest measurements of the country ’ s progress . <PARA> as lisa maragakis of johns hopkins explained , “ the spread of the coronavirus so far has been more like a patchwork quilt than a wave ,” with the virus wreaking havoc to varying degrees in different areas at different times . <PARA> in other words , if most <MASK> had curbed the spread of covid - 19 and reduced their number of new daily cases since the start of the outbreak , while populous <MASK> did not , the nation ’ s moving average would not reflect the majority of the country ’ s progress , lending some credibility to trump ’ s <MASK> that most of the country was making positive steps . <PARA> that was not the case , however . less than a dozen <MASK> were tallying a downward trend of new cases per 100 , 000 people , as of late october , according to johns hopkins data . as seen in the below - displayed graphic , <MASK> in shades of orange were experiencing a surge in new cases as of late october , and <MASK> in shades of green were seeing a decline in new cases . the darker the shade , the bigger the change . <PARA> another compilation of the tracking project ’ s data by the washington post came to the same conclusion . the graphics below showed how the pandemic progressed in summer and fall by comparing the daily rates of new cases to each <MASK> ’ s peak , or its highest increase in new cases for one day . <PARA> as you can see , most <MASK> ’ trajectories appeared to be worsening rapidly . “ we see no <MASK> that any <MASK> in the current surge has reached its peak and begun to decline ,” the covid tracking project tweeted on oct . 29 . <PARA> here ’ s the bottom line : the outbreak was far from under control — no matter what each presidential candidate <MASK> in their final pitches to voters . <PARA> “ we should have been way down in baseline and daily cases , and we ’ re not ,” fauci said , while speaking with the the journal of the american medical association . <PARA> in sum , scientists as of this writing were expecting the rolling average of new covid - 19 cases to continue to climb , with no indication that they had peaked or would begin to decline . so by describing the country as “ rounding the turn ” on covid - 19 , the president was blatantly mischaracterizing actual covid -

1,"the use of deadly force by police officers is the subject of long - standing concern in the united <MASK> , and the internet is often the venue for debates about the causes of fatal encounters between law enforcement agents and members of the public . <PARA> in september 2018 , a meme shared on facebook pointed the finger at one cause in particular for the relatively high rate of police killings in the united <MASK> : the length of time required to become a police officer . <PARA> the meme compared the duration of police academy training and the number of police killings in recent years , in each of three nordic countries ( norway , finland , and iceland ) and the united <MASK> : <PARA> this is our overview of the accuracy of those <MASK> : <PARA> candidates become police officers in norway after completing a three - year bachelor ’ s degree in police studies , administered centrally by the norwegian police university college in the capital city oslo . the college ’ s web site describes the training as follows : <PARA> in order to be accepted into training , the applicant must meet certain requirements : must be a norwegian citizen , speak good norwegian , have a high school degree , and be physically fit and healthy . <PARA> according to multiple sources , norwegian police fatally shot four people between 2002 and 2016 . <PARA> in their 2014 annual report , the norwegian bureau for the investigation of police affairs wrote that : <PARA> a further two fatal shootings took place in 2015 and 2016 , as detailed by the english - language news website the local in november 2016 : <PARA> we did not find any <MASK> of another police killing in norway since november 2016 . <PARA> in fact , a three - year bachelor ’ s degree is required to become a police officer in finland . the country ’ s police university college (“ poliisiammattikorkeakoulu ” in finnish ) outlines the course of study on their web site : <PARA> although this particular <MASK> in the meme is not fully <MASK> , the reality ( i . e ., a three - year college degree is required , not just a two - year course ) even more strongly supports the underlying argument in the meme , that police officers in the nordic countries undergo longer training programs than their american counterparts . <PARA> a spokesperson for the national police board in finland provided us a list of nine fatalities attributed to police actions between 2000 and 2018 . however , one of those nine deaths involved a tazer , and another involved a police officer ’ s accidentally shooting a prison guard , so seven members of the public were killed ( all shot dead ) due to actions taken by police since 2000 in finland . <PARA> the national police board spokesperson also provided somewhat extraordinary <MORE> <PARA> the u . s . does not maintain an official national database of incidents in which police officers ’ actions have led to the death of civilians , so we can ’ t know for certain the number of people killed by police between 2001 and 2018 , as vox noted in 2015 : <PARA> however , commendable and methodologically rigorous efforts have been undertaken to create an unofficial database , notably by the fatal encounters website , which has been used as a data source in academic research . <PARA> according to the fatal encounters database , 23 , 977 deaths took place at the hands of police between 2001 and 2018 , which suggests that the figure of “ more than 8 , 000 ” may be a significant underestimation . <PARA> <!– <PARA> this reckoning is supported by another robust source , the guardian ‘ s database of police use of deadly force for 2015 and 2016 , which tallied 1 , 146 and 1 , 093 deaths in 2015 and 2016 , respectively . those figures suggest that the meme ’ s tally of about 450 persons killed on average per year by police over the last 18 years is probably on the low side . <PARA> –> <PARA> the factual <MASK> in the meme are mostly accurate , but the underlying implication behind the meme , that shorter training programs cause the relatively high number of police killings in the united <MASK> , is questionable . <PARA> several unmentioned factors are likely to be more relevant and prominent as causes . according to a 2015 <MASK> by the sociologist and criminal justice professor paul hirschfield , these include : the arming of police ( which is not routine in norway and iceland , though it is in finland ), a higher prevalence of guns among the general public (“ american police are primed to expect guns ”), decentralized and under - resourced police training ( although hirschfield does not mention the duration of training as a factor ), and racial biases ( whether conscious or unconscious ) among law enforcement officers . <PARA> although it ’ s <MASK> that the united <MASK> has a vastly higher population than any of the nordic countries mentioned in the meme , it has a much higher prevalence of police killings , even when population is taken into account . <PARA> we counted the total number of police killings in each country between 2002 and 2017 ( using fatal encounters ’ data for the u . s .), then adjusted for each country ’ s average population over the course of that 16 -

1,"a man was driving when a traffic camera flashed . he thought his picture was taken for exceeding the speed limit , even though he knew he was not speeding . just to be sure , he went around the block and passed the same spot , driving even more slowly , but again the camera flashed . he thought this was quite funny , so he slowed down even further as he drove past the area , but the traffic camera flashed yet again . he tried a fourth time with the same result . the fifth time he was laughing when the camera flashed as he rolled past at a snail ’ s pace . <PARA> two weeks later , he got five traffic fine letters in the mail for driving without a seat belt . <PARA> <MASK> : this rollicking tale about misplaced assumptions began circulating on the internet in may 2009 . while it can ’ t be definitively disproved , for the following reasons it ’ s likely better regarded as a legend rather than as an account of an actual incident . <PARA> photo speed traps or “ snap traps ” ( cameras linked to speed detection devices that automatically photograph vehicles exceeding the speed limit then mail tickets to the owners of those vehicles ) react only to the speed of whatever passes before them ; they don ’ t analyze and react to anything else . they ’ re not geared to detect whether a car ’ s occupants are wearing seat belts ; these cameras merely record visual images of the automobiles that the speed detection apparatus feeding into them has already determined are breaking the law . <PARA> working out the rate of speed is relatively easy for these automated devices . it usually involves no more than a matter of two sets of sensors having been embedded into the road a short distance from one another ; if the second array of sensors buried in the roadbed is triggered in too short a timespan after the first , <PARA> the machine “ knows ” the car passing in front of it is exceeding the speed limit , quickly works out the rate of travel , takes a photograph , and generates a ticket . it ’ s purely a matter of math ; no judgment or evaluation on the part of the machine is required . <PARA> the detection of who in a car is wearing a seat belt , however , would be quite a different matter . for a snap trap of this sort to work , it would have to quickly analyze a visual image of the car ’ s occupants to note the absence of safety restraints . given that seat belts come in various colors , as does the clothing people wear , definitively determining that seat belts are not correctly in place would likely be well beyond any current scanning device ’ s <MORE> , vehicles come in various heights , so a camera correctly aimed to pick off a clear visual image of those riding in a toyota prius would be flummoxed by a hummer . <PARA> a fellow did once get himself five speeding tickets in short order from an automated speed trap , but such result was due to an ill - controlled temper , not machine malfunction . in an incident that took place in arizona in 2007 , 21 - year - old brian ward ( a catcher formerly in the atlanta braves organization ) was clocked by speed enforcement cameras five times between 24 february and 26 february of that year . each time he was traveling at least 98 mph , and on one occasion he was going as fast as 122 mph .

1,"splenda is the trademarked brand name of a sucralose - based artificial sweetener which is several hundred times sweeter than ordinary table sugar ( sucrose ). according to legend , the discovery of sucralose was ( like that of another artificial sweetener , aspartame ) something of an accident that occurred by happenstance during the course of unrelated research : <PARA> after gaining approval by regulatory agencies in the u . s . and canada ( and other countries ) in the 1990s , sucralose - based splenda overtook aspartame - based equal and nutrasweet and saccharin - based sweet ’ n low as the leading brand in the u . s . artificial sweetener market . the advantages of sucralose over regular sugar are many : it is so sweet that it can be used in much smaller quantities than sugar , it contains no calories , it has no harmful effect on teeth , it can be safely consumed by diabetics , and it is heat - stable and therefore suitable for use in baked goods . <PARA> in the years since then , sucralose has ( like aspartame before it ) become the target of <MASK> <MASK> that it is “ unnatural ” and therefore unsafe : <PARA> such <MASK> , as uc davis professor carolyn de la peña noted in her <MASK> of artificial sweeteners , have been fomented in part by the sweetener industry itself despite the established safety of those products : <PARA> as is typical in internet - circulated food health warnings like the example reproduced above ( which was largely cribbed from a seventeen - year - old <MASK> <MASK> published on the questionable mercola . com web site ), all of the information it presents is inaccurate , misleading , and / or outdated . the notion that sucralose has not been subjected to a reasonable and sufficient amount of safety testing is , in particular , woefully inaccurate . <PARA> sucralose has , across the span of many years , been subjected to extensive batteries of short - term and long - term studies in both animals and humans ( more than a hundred of which were reviewed during the fda approval process for sucralose ), and none of them has demonstrated any significant risk to humans associated with the consumption of sucralose in normal amounts . a human tolerance study published in the journal food and chemical toxicology in 2000 , for example , found “ no indication that adverse effects on human health would occur from frequent or long - term exposure to sucralose at the maximum anticipated levels of intake ”: <PARA> the chapter on sucralose in the textbook artificial sweeteners also surveys the extensive body of safety testing that has been performed on sucralose , including those involving long - term exposure and doses far in excess of recommended amounts : <PARA> the most frequently cited study supposedly documenting the harmful effects of sucralose was one <MORE> ” is both inaccurate and relatively meaningless . the fact that the human body does not metabolize sucralose for energy is a positive : it ’ s what makes sucralose non - caloric and therefore ideal as an artificial sweetener . most sucralose is unabsorbed and therefore passes harmlessly through the body ; a relatively small amount (~ 15 %) of consumed sucralose is absorbed but is excreted via urination with no harmful effects : <PARA> as is also typical with internet - circulated food health warnings , the accompanying laundry list of “ reported symptoms ” should be taken with many grains of salt . self - reported adverse events are simply anecdotal raw data ; there is no certainty that the reported events were actually due to the product consumed , much less that they demonstrate a causal relationship between the product and the reported events ( especially after consumers are influenced by reading anti - sucralose reports that list what symptoms they ’ re “ supposed ” to be experiencing ). such determinations cannot be made until reports have been investigated , evaluated , and analyzed , and no studies have confirmed that the symptoms listed are a common reaction to sucralose . as dr . joe schwarz observed in his work on food myths and misconceptions : <PARA> there is one thing this piece did get right , although it ’ s both outdated and irrelevant to the issue of the safety of sucralose : the manufacturer of splenda was indeed sued ( nearly fourteen years ago ) by a competitor over their slogan “ made from sugar , so it tastes like sugar ,” which <MASK> implied to consumers that splenda “ in some way actually was sugar , but with the calories stripped out ”: <PARA> after the lawsuit was settled , splenda debuted a new slogan : “ just what ’ s good — it ’ s made from sugar . it tastes like sugar . but it ’ s not sugar .” <PARA> on 11 march 2016 , numerous news outlets reported that an italian study ( published in january 2016 ) purportedly documented a link between splenda and cancer in mice . the international food information council ( ific ), a non - profit group aimed at providing science - based <MASK> with respect to food safety , addressed the publication of the study in an <MASK> that criticized the study ’ s methodology and dissonant findings : <PARA> ific concluded that the “ safety and effectiveness of sucralose ( and other low - calorie sweeteners in foods ) is incredibly well supported ,” and added that “ you shouldn ’ t hesitate to swap them into your diet ” in efforts to reduce caloric intake . on 11 march 2016 , splenda issues a <MASK> via their facebook page referencing the ific <MASK> and asserting the italian study ’ s conclusion was an outlier among dozens to the contrary :",2014-01-20T08:00:00+00:00,train_7266,train,misinfo

1,"as we ’ ve noted many times in these pages , one common way in which people attempt to demonstrate the aptness of a particular social or political viewpoint is to put its expression into the mouth of a revered historical figure . <PARA> surely if one of great minds of our civilization , someone who lived hundreds ( or even thousands ) of years ago , said the very same thing we ’ re thinking today , then surely that ’ s <MASK> we ’ ve hit upon some eternal truth that should be sagaciously heeded . in short , attributing apocryphal <MASK> to everyone from confucius to abraham lincoln is an attempt to capitalize on the maxim that “ great minds think alike .” <PARA> one prime representative of this phenomenon is the passage reproduced above , which warns about the perils of governments ’ overspending their budgets and lavishing too much money on foreign aid and welfare programs . for the last half century it has been attributed to roman philosopher and <MASK> marcus tullius cicero and widely <MASK> by politicians and pundits seeking to bolster their arguments in favor of fiscal conservatism . for example , louisiana representative otto passman , who for thirty years “ pursued a relentless battle against spending for foreign aid ” in the u . s . congress , read these words into the congressional record on april 25 , 1968 : <PARA> on march 29 , 1971 the chicago tribune published a letter from a reader who invoked the same words to make a similar point : <PARA> those words were never uttered by cicero , however ; and the reason no one ever <MASK> them as such until about fifty years ago is because they weren ’ t written until 1965 . they sprang from the pen of taylor caldwell , a fiction writer best known for historical novels such as captains and the kings , her 1972 best - selling chronicle of the rise to wealth and power of an irish immigrant named joseph francis xavier armagh ( which was also made into a popular television mini - series in 1976 ). <PARA> caldwell penned several novels based on real - life religious and historical figures , including genghis khan ( the earth is the lord ’ s ), cardinal richelieu ( the arm and the darkness ), saint luke ( dear and glorious physician ), saint paul ( great lion of god ), aspasia ( glory and the lightning ), and judas iscariot ( i , judas ). her 1965 effort a pillar of iron was a historical novel about the life of cicero , the great roman <MASK> who “ is a pillar of iron as he publicly maintains his search for honor and justice under law in the face of plots against his life and his country .” <PARA> although a pillar of iron often drew directly from the recorded speeches and letters of cicero for its dialogue , it was nonetheless a work of fiction , and the now famous <MASK> from cicero about “ balancing the budget ” was an invention of caldwell ’ s and not a reproduction of cicero ’ s own words . in fact , the novel doesn ’ t even present these words as something spoken by cicero , but rather as a summation of cicero ’ s political philosophy presented as a preface to an imagined conversation between cicero and gaius antonius hybrida : <PARA> as jess stearn observed in in search of taylor caldwell , this imagined historical conversation was reflective of caldwell ’ s own political outlook much more than cicero ’ s : “ she was a conservative politically , believing the spoils belonged to those who toiled for them . there were not free lunches . she abhorred the welfare philosophy that gave handouts to free - loaders , decrying rewards for indolence and incompetence .” or , as john blundell aptly quipped in ladies for liberty , “ taylor caldwell gives us fiscal policy , civil service reform , cuts in aid to less developed countries , and welfare reform all in one sentence .” <PARA> the reproductions of caldwell ’ s words as a historical <MASK> from cicero have altered the <MASK> a fair bit over the years : the admonition that “ prudence and frugality should be put into practice as soon as possible ” was quickly dropped from the end of the sentence ; “ people ” have replaced “ mobs ” as the ones who should be “ forced to work and not depend on the government for subsistence ”; the proclamation that the “ arrogance of the generals should be tempered and controlled ” now refers to generic “ officialdom ” rather than military figures ; and the warning that this advice need be followed “ lest rome become bankrupt ” has mutated into the more ominous - sounding “ lest rome fall .”",2013-05-09T01:12:36+00:00,train_8083,train,misinfo

does the puffery inherent to this summary mean there was nothing substantial to celebrate , else the list would provide details of those in preference to making the wild <MASK> it does ?” <PARA> which brings us to the twin sadnesses of the matter : the list serves to obscure african - american contributions that should have been celebrated by shifting attention to items that were not nearly as vital , and makes black men and women who invented great things appear trivial <PARA> by highlighting only their lesser innovations . <PARA> for example , you have richard spikes ( of the improved automatic gear shift discussed above ) to thank for your car ’ s turn signals . he invented automatic directional lights , which were first installed on a pierce arrow automobile in 1913 . <PARA> in 1935 frederick mckinley jones ( of the portable air conditioning unit ) invented the first refrigerated truck . he kept tinkering at his innovation , eventually developing a highly successful automatic refrigeration system for long - haul carriers . prior to jones ’ invention , many people were primarily limited to eating foods grown locally , because perishable goods could not be efficiently transported over longer distances . <PARA> percy julian came up with a soy protein concoction that put out gas and oil fires not extinguishable by water . this material , known as “ bean soup ” aboard u . s . navy ships , saved the lives of countless sailors during world war ii . that same man , percy julian , came up with a way to synthesize cortisone , a sterol that has eased the sufferings of millions . prior to his work , sterols cost several hundreds of dollars per gram ; his process brought that cost down to 20 cents per gram . <PARA> even the relatively minor innovations to existing technologies for which the african - americans listed above were responsible are important and vital in their own way , of course , but the “ life without black people ” piece misses its target due to too many inaccuracies and trivialities . there is much to laud in the roll call of black inventors , and someone should do them better service than the above - <MASK> <MASK> does . <PARA> barbara “ inventing my spleen ” mikkelson",2011-05-25T03:11:48+00:00,train_4876,train,misinfo

1,"u . s . senate minority leader chuck schumer ( d - new york ) is a career politician who cut his teeth in the new york <MASK> assembly before being elected to the u . s . house of representatives in 1981 , where he served nine terms prior to winning a u . s . senate seat in 1998 . <PARA> as the voice of the opposition party in the senate , schumer was frequently at odds with president trump and the republicans . these disputes spilled over into social media , where schumer not only exchanged barbs with the president himself , but was regularly attacked by trump supporters hoping to discredit him . <PARA> in december 2018 , some of trump ’ s followers shared posts asserting that schumer had been “ caught ” accepting excessive campaign contributions and failing to properly disclose expenses in 1998 : <PARA> the proximate source of the accusation appeared to be an 11 december editorial by fox news pundit tucker carlson attempting to refute the argument that trump ’ s alleged hush money payments to mistresses during the 2016 presidential campaign constituted grounds for impeachment because they violated campaign finance laws . <PARA> in defense of trump , carlson noted that both barack obama and chuck schumer paid hefty fines to the federal election commission ( fec ) for past campaign violations yet suffered no further legal consequences for their actions ( emphasis added ): <PARA> as we ’ ve had occasion to explain before , the hush money payments trump ’ s attorney admitted making on his behalf and more routine campaign finance violations such as failing to comply with contribution caps or improperly disclosing expenses bear little similarity . although obama ’ s 2008 campaign was indeed fined $ 375 , 000 by the fec for not providing timely notice of contributions exceeding $ 1 , 000 , the violation was not deemed intentional and did not rise to the level of a prosecutable offense . <PARA> neither did the violations alleged in schumer ’ s case rise to the level of a prosecutable offense , as enumerated in an fec audit report released to the public in april 2001 . the figures cited by carlson roughly matched those contained in a summary of the audit published that may : <PARA> as noted by the fec , the larger figure ($ 6 , 354 , 835 in improperly disclosed disbursements , characterized as “ expenses ”) comprised amounts that were erroneously reported as lump sum entries instead of being broken out by date and amount as required . the error was subsequently corrected . <PARA> it ’ s misleading to say that schumer was “ caught ” taking excessive campaign contributions . the contributions were categorized by the fec as such on a technicality : schumer ’ s campaign failed to comply with a rule ( later dropped from fec regulations ) stipulating that checks accepted from joint bank accounts be signed by both account holders . a small fraction of those donations were duly refunded , leaving an outstanding $ 854 , 404 in contributions that still met the criteria for being “ excessive ,” fec auditors concluded . the schumer campaign committee ’ s lawyer affirmed to associated press in april 2003 that : <PARA> for the latter violation , the campaign agreed to pay a fine of $ 130 , 000 ( not $ 138 , 000 , as later <MASK> by carlson and others ). however , the suggestion that the violations and subsequent fine ought to have disqualified from remaining in office is unrealistic and naive . <PARA> “ there are always reporting violations in campaigns ,” a former fec commissioner told us in february 2018 . some violations are more serious than others , but even when they result in large civil penalties ( as in the cases of the schumer and obama campaigns ), they are rarely regarded , in the absence of criminal intent , as having any bearing on a candidate ’ s fitness to hold office . in 1993 , for instance , the fec fined sen . bob dole ’ s ( r - kansas ) 1988 presidential campaign $ 120 , 000 for accepting improper corporate donations and exceeding spending limits , yet dole not only ran for president again but remained in office right up until his retirement in 1996 .",2019-01-08T20:58:51+00:00,test_1086,test,misinfo

1,"in february 2016 , a meme about the lack of business acumen and experience exhibited by vermont senator bernie sanders , a democratic presidential candidate , began circulating online : <PARA> the criticisms offered in meme were a mixture of <MASK> , <MASK> , irrelevant , and misleading <MASK> . to wit : <PARA> never owned a business <PARA> right off , this meme begins with a rather nebulous criticism . although having owned a business is an experience many voters would like to see on the résumé of a potential chief executive , a literal application of that term isn ’ t of much relevance . technically , a person who once operated a roadside lemonade stand has “ owned a business ,” while a person who has spent his career serving as the ceo of a public multi - national , multi - billion dollar corporation has not — even though everyone would agree the latter has vastly more business experience than the former . and certainly a number of highly - regarded u . s . presidents in the modern era ( e . g ., franklin roosevelt , dwight eisenhower , john kennedy , ronald reagan ) never owned their own businesses . <PARA> moreover , one might validly say that sanders started and operated his own business ( whether he “ owned ” it is somewhat arguable , as it was a non - profit ), the american people ’ s historical society , which was created in 1978 to produce educational film strips about the <MASK> of vermont . the university of vermont has archived several of the brochures produced by the american people ’ s historical society , one of which includes a <MASK> from sanders outlining the purpose of his film strips : <PARA> while the financials of the american people ’ s historical society are not available , sanders wrote in his memoir outsider in the house that the business was reasonably successful and “ a lot of fun .” a friend of sanders ’ told politico that the film strip business “ wasn ’ t just a way to make money ... he made filmstrips about people he admired and believed in . he just thought kids should know the truth of how things really were .” <PARA> never invented anything <PARA> once again , this is a rather nebulous criticism . the concept of “ inventing ” something could range from simply thinking up a novel idea ( but doing nothing more about it ), to creating and building a device for personal use ( but not marketing it ), to actually obtaining a patent for a new product . bernie sanders is certainly no inventor and holds no patents , but it ’ s hard to see how that fact is of any relevance , as the same is <MASK> of nearly every u . s . president . <PARA> thomas jefferson might legitimately be considered an inventor <MORE> holds six senate committee appointments ), meet with constituents , participate in oversight and investigation of governmental affairs , etc ., as detailed in “ the many roles of a member of congress ”: <PARA> lived off welfare before elected to public office <PARA> as noted above , various acquaintances who knew sanders in the years before he achieved public office have reported that he was “ always poor ,” and he likely received public assistance at some point during that time , although what form of ( and how much ) assistance he received is difficult to determine at this remove . a contemporaneous newspaper account from the bennington banner reported that in 1974 , when sanders ran for the u . s . senate on the liberty union party ticket , he was collecting unemployment benefits : <PARA> 74 year old — personal net worth of $ 300 , 000 <PARA> as 247 wall st . reported , determining the precise net worth of candidates is difficult for a number of reasons : <PARA> 247 wall st . attempted to determine each presidential candidate ’ s net worth in an <MASK> published on 24 august 2015 . they estimated that sanders was one of the “ poorest presidential candidates ” running for office in 2016 , with a likely net worth somewhere around $ 330 , 000 : <PARA> as of late 2019 , open secrets , the website of the center for responsive politics , estimated sanders ’ net worth at between $ 729 , 000 and $ 1 . 8 million , making him neither the richest nor the poorest presidential hopeful in the 2020 field . <PARA> in any case , the meme ’ s characterization of sanders as a “ loser ” based on his net worth evinces a rather skewed perspective . although many people view financial rewards as a tangible measure of one ’ s success , it is far from the only factor by which accomplishment can be measured . ( in fact , highly - regarded president harry s . truman had virtually no net worth even after leaving the white house in 1953 and afterwards was largely dependent upon congress ’ finally establishing a pension for former presidents .) <PARA> bernie sanders might equally be considered a “ winner ” for persevering at his goal of achieving a political career long after others might have given up , and for succeeding at that effort despite prolonged financial hardship . unlike many others , sanders might also be lauded for maintaining a rather plain life and not having enriched himself in public service ( especially since candidates at the other end of the financial spectrum are frequently criticized for being “ out of touch with the common man ”). <PARA> as 247 wall st . wrote of sanders : <PARA> all in all , that sounds like quite an impressive career achievement for anyone — regardless of net worth .",2016-02-04T21:18:56+00:00,dev_1272,dev,misinfo

1,"in august 2017 , several news outlets reported that public health authorities in the <MASK> of iowa had advised against serving certain alcoholic drinks in copper mugs : <PARA> iowa ’ s alcoholic beverages division did indeed publish an advisory bulletin on 28 july 2017 : <PARA> the bulletin goes on to explain that the food and drug administration food code prohibits food or drink with ph levels of below 6 ( that is , relatively acidic food and drinks ) coming in contact with copper at a licensed premises like a bar or restaurant . the reasoning behind this , according to page 485 of the fda food code , is that there is a slight but definite risk of poisoning : <PARA> the fda code adds that anyone serving beverages ( including water ) through pipes must also have adequate mechanisms in place to prevent copper from leaching into drinks . it also points out that while copper is an important part of the fermentation required to brew beer , too much copper ( above 0 . 2 mg per liter ) kills yeast , so the level of copper leached into successfully - brewed beer falls below what is toxic to humans ( about 3 . 5 mg per liter and above ). <PARA> the 28 july 2017 <MASK> by the iowa alcoholic beverages division does not contain new information , new research , or a new warning about drinking from copper mugs . it is effectively a reminder , in light of the recent popularity of the moscow mule , that iowa has incorporated the federal regulations contained in the fda food code . that code has contained the same restrictions on copper plumbing and containers , and the same rationale , since at least 1997 . <PARA> it ’ s clear that although copper is an important naturally occurring trace element , it can also be toxic to humans . it is also clear that toxic levels of copper can leach into food and water through both copper containers ( such as those used for acidic drinks like the moscow mule and other beverages ) and through copper or copper alloy plumbing . <PARA> however , what ’ s less clear is how much copper is enough to make you sick , and how likely it is that you ’ ll be harmed by drinking a cocktail from a copper mug . <PARA> in 1991 , the environmental protection agency established a “ maximum contaminant level goal ” for copper of 1 . 3 mg per liter of fluid ( page 130 ). according to the epa , the mclg is “ the maximum level of a contaminant in drinking water at which no known or anticipated adverse effect on the health of persons would occur , allowing an adequate margin of safety ”. a 1999 study in the journal environmental health perspectives concluded that copper levels above 3 mg per liter of drinking water <MORE> replied : <PARA> solioz emphasized that while the risk from typical consumption is probably low for most people , a small proportion of the population ( around 1 in 30 , 000 people ) have wilson disease , which causes an accumulation of copper within the body , and could potentially be harmed by consuming acidic beverages from a copper container . <PARA> while most people are able to effectively secrete copper , solioz said , those with wilson disease struggle to do this , so even the relatively low level of copper leached into a drink could make them sick . <PARA> solioz told us he was unaware of any research which specifically measured the rate of copper leaching in containers carrying beverages of various acidities , and over various time periods . we were also unable to find such research . <PARA> the closest thing to this that we could find was a short 1957 report published in the american journal of public health . this report described an outbreak of nausea , vomiting and diarrhea among nurses at a military hospital in 1954 . the nurses consumed cocktails at a party that had been sitting in copper - contaminated cocktail shakers for more than two hours before many of them became sick . dr john wylie , the report ’ s author , wrote : <PARA> the cocktail was reconstructed , yielding the equivalent of 179 mg of copper per liter . wylie concluded : <PARA> it ’ s very difficult to conclude anything from this about the rate at which cocktails might typically become contaminated in copper containers : this was a short and decades - old case report , not a scientific study ( which could have controlled for various possible causal factors ); the author does not make it clear whether he himself was present for the incident ; and wylie also suggests that the level of copper leaching in the cocktail was linked to significant damage to the container . despite these serious shortcomings , the 1957 report formed the basis of the epa ’ s 1991 decision that the “ maximum contaminant level goal ” for copper in drinking water should be 1 . 3 mg per liter . this recommendation remains in place in august 2017 . <PARA> we also asked iowa ’ s department of inspections and appeals for <MASK> on reports of copper poisoning in the <MASK> , in order to see whether there had been a spike in symptoms accompanying the increased popularity of the moscow mule , but we were told that the <MASK> ’ s department of public health does not track such reports . <PARA> iowa ’ s alcoholic beverages division , meanwhile , recommends that if bar and restaurant owners are going to use copper mugs for highly - acidic drinks like the moscow mule , they should use copper mugs lined on the inside with other metals like nickel or stainless steel .",2017-08-11T01:37:10+00:00,dev_771,dev,misinfo

1,"in april 2019 , washington <MASK> sen . maureen walsh attracted local and national attention — and criticism — for remarks she made during a debate about legislation intended to improve nurses ’ working conditions . <PARA> on 19 april , the website nurse . org posted a widely shared <MASK> whose headline read : “ senator remarks go viral : nurses ‘ play cards for a considerable amount of the day .'” the <MASK> went on : <PARA> walsh did say , of nurses in certain hospitals , that they “ probably play cards for a considerable amount of the day ,” and she has since said she regrets having done so . however , she made her remarks in a very specific context , and was not referring to all nurses everywhere , despite the impression given in much subsequent commentary and reporting . <PARA> the walla walla senator was speaking during a washington senate floor debate on 16 april , on the subject of shb 1155 , a piece of legislation that would require health - care providers to give clinical employees uninterrupted meal and rest breaks during their shifts , except in emergencies . <PARA> more specifically , walsh was speaking in support of amendment 724 , which was put forward by her republican colleague <MASK> sen . curtis king . that amendment would exempt a certain category of hospitals ( critical access hospitals ) from the requirements of the bill . <PARA> critical access hospitals ( cahs ) are smaller , typically rural hospitals with fewer than 25 in - patient beds that are legally designated as cahs by the federal centers for medicare and medicaid services . because they typically serve relatively isolated rural communities , they receive certain financial support and benefits from the federal government in order to ensure their ongoing sustainability . <PARA> walsh supported the proposed exemption of cahs from the meal and rest - break requirements in shb 1155 , arguing that staff there were not typically as busy as their counterparts in other hospitals , and therefore did not require such mandatory regular breaks . in the interest of completeness , here are walsh ’ s remarks in full , which can also be watched here ( beginning at around 9 : 10 ): <PARA> in a <MASK> sent to snopes , the washington <MASK> nurses association rejected one of the premises of walsh ’ s call for cahs to be exempted from the proposed new requirements , arguing that , far from being in grave financial danger , “ the majority of these small , rural hospitals are financially healthy and well equipped to implement shb 1155 ’ s patient safety standards ,” adding that : “ over the last four years of reports , the total net income ( surplus ) for washington ’ s 40 critical access hospitals is $ 208 , 657 , 776 , with an average surplus of $ 5 , 216 , 444 per hospital . <PARA> when one views walsh ’ s remarks in their full and proper context , it ’ s clear that her “ playing cards ” comment related specifically to nurses in cahs (“ those nurses ”). she was not <MASK> that all nurses everywhere spend much of their working days playing cards . <PARA> this is in contrast to the impression created by much of the subsequent coverage of her remarks . for example , nurse . org summarized her remarks as “ nurses ‘ play cards for a considerable amount of the day ,'” without reflecting that walsh was actually describing only a relatively small subcategory of nurses . <PARA> on 19 april , juliana bindas started an online petition on change . org that called for walsh to follow a nurse around during a 12 - hour shift . the text that accompanied the petition ( which had more than 500 , 000 signatures as of 22 april ) also provided a misleading characterization of the senator ’ s comments , <MASK> “ senator maureen walsh <MASK> that we as nurses mostly spend our 12 hour shifts playing cards .” <PARA> similarly , many online memes and social media responses markedly failed to recognize that walsh ’ s remarks had referred to a specific cohort of nurses , and not all nurses in every context . headlines published by major national news outlets including cnn and the hill also failed to reflect the specific context of walsh ’ s comments , instead giving the misleading impression she had been talking about all nurses . <PARA> on 20 april , walsh told the tri - city herald newspaper she regretted her comments , saying “ i was tired . i said something i wish i hadn ’ t .” in a <MASK> provided to the local kepr television <MASK> , the <MASK> senator elaborated further and clarified that her remarks were indeed specifically in reference to nurses at cahs : <PARA> “ my mother was [ a registered nurse ] for many years and i have the greatest respect for nurses . the comment made about the ability to play cards was referring to the staff at the very rural and small critical access hospitals who may only serve a handful of patients and [ where ] the staffing mandates are unnecessary .” <PARA> on 16 april , the washington <MASK> senate passed amendment 724 , along with the revised version of shb 1155 , which subsequently included an exemption for cahs . in the house , a different version of the bill had already been passed , meaning the legislation was scheduled for reconciliation between the two chambers , as of 22 april .",2019-04-22T18:54:50+00:00,dev_688,dev,misinfo
1,"examples : <PARA> on january 15 , 2013 a law enforcement officer in the north end of the greater houston area stopped a semi tractor - trailer driver , who was heading in a southerly direction , during a routine check for drugs . during a search of the cargo of the trailer , he discovered packages of road signs that read the following : “ martial law in effect ”. the driver had a bill of lading in his possession <MASK> that this cargo ’ s destination was to the department of homeland security . <PARA> [ collected via e - mail , 1999 ] <PARA> i met a man last night that used to go to my church . brandon moved last year before i started attending . but several people , including the pastor , say that brandon is totally honest and does not “ go off half - cocked .” <PARA> brandon told me that his wife received a call from her cousin last week . the cousin lives in ohio and her husband is a truck driver for wal - mart . it seems he was driving a load early last week and stopped at a border weigh <MASK> . the inspector wanted to know what was in the load , and the driver indicated he did not know . he merely picked up the trailer and was transporting it to another <MASK> . <PARA> the inspector opened the trailer and saw hundreds of uniform boxes . he asked what was in the boxes and the driver again <MASK> that he didn ’ t know . so the inspector opened a box . <PARA> in the box were about a hundred large ( about 2 ’ x3 ′) plastic signs that <MASK> : “ this city under martial law ” in bright colors . it said something about the federal gov ’ t and had what looked like a legal reference ( the driver <MASK> to know nothing about legal issues , but he thought it was a reference to a law or an executive order or something ). <PARA> there were several hundred boxes of these signs . the driver doesn ’ t know what wal - mart has to do with the signs . but he did <MASK> that wal - mart sometimes hires out space on their trucks if space is available . i might suggest that maybe the federal gov ’ t was using wal - mart trucks to keep a low profile . <PARA> anyway , the info came to me by way of a long route . but the sources are “ innocent bystanders ” with no <MASK> of right - wing reactionary politics . the driver was married to a woman who was related to brandon ’ s wife . brandon swears the info is accurate and that he spoke with the driver himself to confirm what was passed between the respective wives . the driver <MASK> there <MORE> signs would be needed to communicate this <MASK> of affairs to the civilian populace , notices transmitted by television , radio , and the internet would accomplish this purpose just fine . <PARA> if roads needed to be closed , ordinary signs announcing such a closure would serve that purpose . manufacturing special ones would inevitably lead to the government ’ s secret plans being found out , as leaks would soon reach the press from those who produced or transported the signs . better to stockpile a zillion standard “ road closed ” signs than to risk inadvertently announcing what many americans would see as an unwarranted armed takeover . <PARA> okay , so if the signs are a ridiculous flourish in this form of <MASK> , why are they part of the <MASK> ? <PARA> it all comes down to plot device . the signs , you see , are the means by which the government ’ s evil plan is revealed to the unsuspecting citizenry . if a truck full of “ road closed ” signs spilled its contents , not even the most charismatic <MASK> would be able to convince anyone this was all tied to a federal plot to take over the country . but make them “ by order of martial law ” signs , and the <MASK> now has legs to run on . <PARA> ( revelation by way of written communication turns up in urban legends whenever a device is needed to propel the <MASK> forward by way of explaining actions that have taken place . a fine example of this serves as the lynchpin for the dishonest note tale , wherein the miscreant gives away his ruse in the note he pens ; in real life he ’ d either simply scribble something innocuous or just leave a blank piece of paper behind .) <PARA> conspiracy <MASK> like this one play upon fears that the government has too much power and will use it against its citizens given any opportunity to do so . versions of the <MASK> that bring walmart into the picture as a partner in the impending takeover ( by contracting to carry such signs in their trucks ) further establish the basis for this <MASK> as one of fear of the all - powerful : like the government , walmart is viewed by many as a predatory entity too big to control with the ability to be a law unto itself . <PARA> only once in u . s . <MASK> has a president declared martial law on a national basis , and that occurrence took place during the civil war , when abraham lincoln suspended habeas corpus for “ prisoners of war , spies , or aiders and abettors of the enemy ” throughout the united <MASK> . outside of wartime , all other instances of martial law in the u . s . have been imposed on a local basis by governors or mayors .",2013-01-29T03:38:56+00:00,train_4417,train,misinfo
1,"examples : [ collected via e - mail , july 2006 ] <PARA> the next day the swelling was getting progressively worse so off to my regular doctor i went . infected arm – needed an antibiotic . what was interesting is what the dr . told me . the next time you get stung put a penny on the bite for 15 minutes . i thought , wow , next time ( if there ever is one ) i will try it . <PARA> well that night shelley ’ s niece got stung by two bees . when she came over to swim i looked at the bite and it had already started to swell . so off i went to get my money . taped a penny to her arm for 15 minutes . the next morning , there was no sign of a bite . wow , were we surprised . her niece , we decided , just wasn ’ t allergic to the sting . <PARA> well guess what happened again on saturday night . i was helping shelley dead head her flowers and guess what , you are right , i got bit again two times by a hornet on my left hand . was i ticked . i thought here i go again having to go to the doctor for yet another antibiotic . well i promptly went into the house , again got my money out and taped two pennies to my bites and then sat and sulked for 15 minutes . the penny took the sting out of the bite immediately . i still wasn ’ t sure what was going to happen . <PARA> in the meantime the hornets were attacking shelley and she got bit on the thumb . again the penny . the next morning i would only see the spot where he had got me . no redness , no swelling . went over to see shelley and hers was the same . couldn ’ t even tell where she got bit . then shelley got stung again on monday night on her back cutting grass . this penny thing is going to make us money at school . again it worked . <PARA> just wanted to share the marvelous information in case any of you are experiencing the same problem at home . we need to have a stock of pennies on hand at school . <PARA> the dr . said somehow the copper in the penny counteracts the bite . i would never had believed it . but it definitely does work . <PARA> just wanted to share a bit of information for school . a couple of weeks ago i was unfortunate enough to get stung by both a bee and hornet while working in the garden . my arm swelled up so off to the doctor i went . the clinic gave me cream and an antihistimine . the next day the swelling was <MORE> and the crying will stop quickly . <PARA> there appears to be nothing magical about pennies ( which in the u . s . are coins now composed of 97 . 5 % zinc slugs coated with 2 . 5 % copper ) and insect stings . taping one to a victim ’ s arm is not known to be an effective counter to such injuries . other than that one tip on a british site , we <PARA> were unable to find mention of this treatment in any of the sources we checked , and we certainly encountered any number of other purported bee sting “ cures .” <PARA> folk medicine is rife with such suggestions . each is said by its proponents to greatly reduce or even eliminate swelling and soreness inflicted by stinging insects . while no such list could ever be complete ( given that people are constantly trying new things , then vehemently swearing by them , even as their “ miracle cures ” fail to work for anyone else ), the more commonly - recommended folk remedies to be applied to the sites of stings are : <PARA> of those , ice looks to be the most effective . those who instead turn to their physicians for relief from bee stings will likely be prescribed oral antihistamines and / or topical ( cream or ointment ) cortisteroid preparations . <PARA> key to any recovery , however , is removing the bee ’ s stinger from the wound as soon after the attack as possible . whereas some say it doesn ’ t matter how the item is extracted , others assert the importance of eschewing the use of tweezers and instead advocate scratching the site in <PARA> hopes of catching the edge of the stinger and so easing it out . behind this recommendation lies the idea that the venom sac remains attached to the stinger , thus any pinching of the organ will force further venom into the victim . <PARA> for most people , being stung by a bee amounts to no more than a transitory annoyance : the site of the attack hurts like the dickens for a bit , and a hard swollen lump ( which then becomes red and itchy ) forms there . however , some people are allergic to the venom injected by bees and thus can potentially lose their lives in short order if appropriate medical intervention is not provided in time . about 100 people a year die from allergic reactions to bee stings . <PARA> you ’ re having an allergic reaction to the sting if there is subsequent swelling beyond the site of attack ( especially if that swelling affects the face or the neck ), or have difficulty breathing , find yourself suddenly wheezing or feeling dizzy , or experience a drop in blood pressure . get medical help if any of those happen . <PARA> barbara “ bee aware ” mikkelson",2011-07-06T02:40:48+00:00,train_7781,train,misinfo
1,"on 26 december 2015 , facebook user timothy delaney published the above - reproduced <MASK> update ; it was widely shared , and appeared to be a possible iteration of the common shunned serviceman urban legend . <PARA> according to delaney , his “ son [ connor ] went in [ to the gas <MASK> next to higbie bagels , a mobil ] to buy chew ” and presented military identification to verify his age . delaney says the cashier said “‘ no army ’, not here ,” adding : <PARA> we spoke to the owner of the mobil gas <MASK> . he told us that delaney ’ s son indeed attempted to purchase tobacco at his gas <MASK> , although neither delaney nor the gas <MASK> provided a date on which this occurred . <PARA> the owner <MASK> that delaney ’ s son presented a military id card , which indicated he was not yet 21 . in suffolk county , where the mobil is located , tobacco laws changed in january 2015 : while 19 was the minimum age for tobacco purchases until 2014 , in 2015 the age rose to 21 . a release dated 31 december 2014 explained : <PARA> it ’ s possible that the young man misinterpreted the interaction ; had that gas <MASK> violated the law , they would have faced a minimum fine of $ 300 . the gas <MASK> owner emphasized that the customer was both friendly and well - behaved . the owner also said footage of the transaction could be retrieved , but that the security tapes would have to be sent out to a company in order to extract that transaction amid hours of other footage . <PARA> we attempted to contact delaney , who provided non - responsive answers to our questions . however , on 29 december 2015 , a reader unrelated to the controversy forwarded a facebook post dated july 2015 which suggested connor delaney turned 21 in that month . <PARA> on 29 december , we again contacted the owner of the mobil <MASK> to ask about the transaction . the owner told us that the <MASK> utilizes id scanning technology which only recognizes new york <MASK> id . such scanners are commonly in use in other local establishments dealing in tobacco and alcohol . <PARA> the owner further <MASK> that delaney ’ s id didn ’ t scan , and that the clerk asked him how old he was . according to the owner , delaney <MASK> he was 20 ; the clerk advised him that under the new law in suffolk county , customers must be 21 to purchase tobacco . the owner <MASK> that delaney then said he currently lived in another <MASK> , in which he was able to purchase tobacco freely . <PARA> the owner added that <MASK> guidance with respect to age verification encouraged use of a “ right to refuse ” during any transaction in which the customer appeared to be under the age of 25 ( or 40 ) and was unable to prove their age . as the owner <MASK> , <MASK> guidelines emphasize caution in accepting identification ; any mistakes made are the responsibility of the retail outlet : <PARA> that same <MASK> - issued guidance addressed the use of id scanning technology for sales of alcohol and tobacco : <PARA> modern iterations of the “ shunned serviceman ” <MASK> tend to target attendants who appear to be of arab extraction . prior <MASK> predicated on a near - identical template affixed themselves to a marathon gas <MASK> in pontiac , illinois ; a dunkin ’ donuts location in crown point , indiana ; restaurants in hilton head , south carolina , and duluth , minnesota ; a shell gas <MASK> in tennessee ; a shady maple restaurant in pennsylvania ; a charley ’ s grilled subs outlet in stockton , california ; and a sak - n - pak gas <MASK> in corbin , kentucky . <PARA> we visited the mobil location on higbie lane in west islip , new york at approximately 5 : 40 pm on 30 december 2015 ; after speaking with an employee , we asked if he would provide us with a photograph of the identification scanner he described on the phone : <PARA> it ’ s <MASK> delaney ’ s son was unable to purchase tobacco at the higbie lane mobil on or around 25 december 2015 . however , based on existing information , the reason for that refusal appeared to be due to delaney ’ s inability to verify his age sufficiently .",2015-12-28T17:39:21+00:00,test_1098,test,misinfo
1,"on 3 april 2003 , master sgt . james e . valrie saluted a united <MASK> flag flying over a desert airfield in southern iraq at sunset . a photograph of the moment was captured by his wife , marine sgt . tisha carter - valrie : <PARA> that photograph was later released by the u . s . marine corps has been widely shared online ( often without attribution ) in the ensuing years . it has been posted on numerous blogs , web sites , and social media pages , made into tattoos and postcards , and has even been included in multiple memorial day messages posted by the rock band kiss . <PARA> in july 2018 , this patriotic and moving photograph became the subject of a small controversy when actor james woods <MASK> that he had received a warning about “ offensive ” content from twitter after he shared the image with his followers : <PARA> we attempted to contact woods about the warning he allegedly received but did not receive a response . it ’ s possible that he truly did receive such a warning ( he didn ’ t <MASK> whether the image was accompanied by any text , which could have been the “ offensive ” portion of the tweet ), but we ’ re skeptical that the image alone raised any red flags with twitter , for a number of reasons . <PARA> for starters , this isn ’ t the first time this photograph has been shared on the social network . in fact , woods himself previously used this image in 2015 to call for a boycott of pacsun after the clothing retailer was criticized for selling a t - shirt featuring an upside - down american flag : <PARA> that 2015 tweet has resided on woods ’ timeline for three years without issue . as of this writing , it is still available . <PARA> we searched twitter for other instances of people sharing this photograph over the years and came up with numerous examples , including at least one case in which a user adopted the image as their profile pic , and a tweet from lara trump in may 2018 . <PARA> if twitter truly deemed the image “ offensive ,” these posts would have likely been taken down . however , we ’ ve yet to come across any credible instances of the social network removing this photograph for violating its rules . <PARA> when we reached out to the company to find out why ( or if ) they had issued a warning to woods after he allegedly posted the photograph , they told us that they couldn ’ t comment on the activity of an individual account . they did say , however , that twitter would never “ take action on accounts or content that are not in violation of our rules .” <PARA> so is the photograph in violation of twitter ’ <MORE> <PARA> as it has been repeatedly shared on twitter without issue for a number of years , it seems safe to say that this photograph of a marine saluting a flag does not violate the social network ’ s terms of service . <PARA> woods ’ <MASK> that his posting of the image triggered an offensive content warning is reminiscent of a ploy used by troll facebook pages to stir up anger over non - existent issues . one popular image of a little boy saluting a flag is frequently shared , for instance , as if its “ hateful ” content were being removed from facebook ( despite the fact that the “ banned ” image is included in the very posts <MASK> it has been removed ): <PARA> we investigated this <MASK> back in 2015 and found that it , too , was <MASK> . <PARA> it ’ s possible that woods received a warning message about “ offensive ” content after posting an image of a marine saluting a flag , but if so , it ’ s likely that the warning had more to do with the accompanying text than the image itself . it ’ s also possible that the warning woods allegedly received was due to a twitter user , not the social network itself , flagging the content for being inappropriate for some unexplained reason . <PARA> the <MASK> tweet woods spoke of is not on his timeline ( nor did we find any record of it in archives of woods ’ page , nor in any mentions from his followers , further adding to our skepticism about the <MASK> ), and the actor did not provide specifics about the content of the tweet ( other than the inclusion of a photograph ). therefore , we ’ re unable to comment on which part of woods ’ message could have been deemed “ offensive .” <PARA> we can say , however , that the photograph of master sgt . james e . valrie saluting the united <MASK> flag is not itself in violation of twitter ’ s rules . <PARA> one final note on this viral photograph : the image shared by woods ( and so many others on twitter ) shows the flag at half -

0,"according to a now - viral tiktok video posted on dec . 8 , 2020 , as much as 95 % of serotonin — a key neurotransmitter that plays a role in regulating mood — may be produced in the gastrointestinal tract : <PARA> “ the bacteria in your gut produce about 90 % of the serotonin in your body ,” said social media user gianusystem , a self - identified online community dedicated to bringing awareness to dissociative identity disorder , or multiple personality disorder . the woman goes on to cite an <MASK> in discover magazine , adding that she was skeptical of new information that she hadn ’ t heard before . <PARA> “ so , i went and looked this up . that ’ s the low number ,” said in the video , which at the time of writing had been shared more than 20 , 500 times . <PARA> snopes also looked up the information and found that the <MASK> is mostly <MASK> : estimates suggest that up to 95 % of the serotonin in the body is released in the gut through certain intestinal cells . but there is an important caveat to note : most studies that link serotonin production to the gastrointestinal system have been conducted in animals . according to an <MASK> titled “ gut bacteria ’ s role in anxiety and depression : it ’ s not just in your head ,” which appeared in the november 2020 issue of the science magazine discover , author elizabeth svoboda reported that about 90 % of serotonin produced in the human body is done so in the gut . <PARA> serotonin is a hormone and neurotransmitter responsible for sending chemical messages between cells to play a key role in stabilizing mood , feelings , and happiness . in the brain , serotonin allows cells of the nervous system to communicate with one another and when too little serotonin is produced , a person may experience anxiety , depression , and other emotional and behavioral disorders . such conditions are typically treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( ssris ), or antidepressants , that the mayo clinic said work by increasing levels of serotonin by blocking the reuptake of serotonin into some neurons , making the hormone more available to improve the transmission of messages . <PARA> while serotonin is most well - known for its role in the brain , the hormone is also found in the stomach and intestines where it helps to maintain bowel movements and function , noted the hormone health network , an affiliate of the endocrine society . and some researchers postulate that a greater understanding of serotonin production in the gut may inform the treatment of certain mental health conditions in the brain . <PARA> in 2015 , researchers at the california institute of technology demonstrated that bacteria normally present in the gut can stimulate the intestinal cells to produce serotonin — as much as 90 % of which is made in the digestive tract . in mice , a particular mixture of bacteria also found in the human gut produced molecules that signaled to gut cells to increase the production of serotonin . modified mice that did not have the bacteria had more than 50 % of their gut serotonin missing . adding that bacterial mixture — which contained turicibacter sanguinis and clostridia — increased serotonin back to a normal level . though the study was conducted on mice , the scientist wrote in the journal cell that the findings lend important insight into how the gut microbiome can influence the nervous system . <PARA> four years later , those same researchers set out to inform how the 100 trillion or so bacteria and hormones that live in the human intestinal system may produce serotonin . this time around , researchers added serotonin to the drinking water of some mice and raised others with a mutation that increased the levels of serotonin in their guts . an analysis of the mice microbiota showed that the presence of t . sanguinis and clostridia increased significantly when there was more serotonin in the gut . as part of the study , mice were also given fluoxetine , or prozac , which was shown to block the serotonin transporter in the t . sanguinis , which slowed the transport of serotonin . <PARA> “ previous studies from our lab and others showed that specific bacteria promote serotonin levels in the gut ,” said study author thomas fung at the time in a news release . “ our new study tells us that certain gut bacteria can respond to serotonin and drugs that influence serotonin , like anti -

1,"a 26 october 2016 post written by carly fraser on her website “ live love fruit ,” which has been shared over a million times on facebook , alleges that various popular brands of tea contain dangerous levels of pesticides . however , the <MASK> inaccurately describes three different testing results that are currently five years out of date . <PARA> at the <MASK> ’ s conclusion , fraser suggested that other brands that were allegedly healthier . the reality is that this post is a textbook example of affiliate marketing , and fraser ’ s blog receives money from amazon if people purchase the teas she linked to . “ i am an affiliate of amazon and link to tea companies i currently drink , trust and recommend ,” fraser told us via email . <PARA> with this context in mind , and with the understanding that the referenced test results are five years out - of - date , we will dissect each of the <MASK> made by fraser and explain how she has muddied the science behind food residue testing . <PARA> in the united <MASK> , governmental bodies regularly test domestic and imported agricultural food commodities to determine how much pesticide residue they might contain . this form of regulation is different than the rules that govern the application of pesticides ; it instead governs the small amounts of pesticide residue allowed to remain in , or on , food products . these limits , termed maximum residue tolerances or limits ( mrls ) are different depending upon both the chemical used and the commodity type because the level of exposure to pesticide residue a consumer might experience through diet differs depending upon the food type . <PARA> in some cases , residue limits are set for dried tea , which is the type of testing highlighted in fraser ’ s <MASK> . setting such limits is a scientifically demanding process , and not all pesticides that show up in tests have established limits for dried tea products . in such cases , the presence of a pesticide - related chemical in the food commodity means the product is considered “ adulterated ,” but that does not mean the product is necessarily subject to regulatory action , as explained to us via email by u . s . food and drug administration ( fda ) residue expert chris sack : <PARA> in essence , this means there are two ways to run afoul of food residue laws as they regard the trace presence of pesticide in food commodities . in cases where there are enough data and research to determine an mrl value for a specific pesticide , a food product can contain levels above a “ legally acceptable limit .” in cases where no mrl is set for a certain chemical on a certain commodity , the mere presence ( above 0 . 01 ppm ) of that chemical is a violation of the law <MORE> larger number of pesticides existed in concentrations that had been medically evaluated to be harmful to humans , as opposed to counting only those chemicals whose presence alone constituted a violation . <PARA> propochlor is considered a human carcinogen under california ’ s proposition 65 , but every cup of coffee sold is considered a carcinogen under california law as well since the law is blind to the how much of a given chemical is present . <PARA> while allowable tolerances for propochlor exist in other products , no such limits have been established for tea , and therefore its presence in a children ’ s tea product ( if <MASK> ) should be troubling . the company faced widespread online backlash and a temporary reduction in share value as a result of the report . <PARA> for what it ’ s worth , hain - celestial described glaucus ’ s results as “ <MASK> and misleading ” and <MASK> they undertook to have the brands highlighted by the glaucus report retested , finding that no pesticides were detected : <PARA> after we reached out to fraser , she updated her post with more detail about some of the chemicals she highlighted . these updates , however , did not really take into account scale . for example , she highlighted endosulfan as an example of a dangerous level of a pesticide residue : <PARA> this <MASK> is <MASK> , but the cbc results she highlighted showed levels of endosulfan in tea at concentrations of 0 . 04 ppm . in the united <MASK> , endosulfan ’ s presence would not be a violation until it reached a concentration of 24 ppm , orders of magnitude higher than the level found in uncle lee ’ s legends of china green tea . <PARA> in short , the <MASK> of dangerous pesticides “ above the legal limit ” rely on incorrect or misleading descriptions of out - of - date testing that was performed in most cases by advocacy groups . these misleading and outdated descriptions were presented , at least in part , for the purpose of making a profit off people clicking online links for organic tea products and muddied the online discourse surrounding pesticide and food science . while the reports accurately highlighted the presence of some pesticide - related chemicals that do not have mrl limits set for dried tea contained in tea products , those reports in nearly all cases did not provide <MASK> of “ dangerous ” or “ deadly ” levels of those chemicals , just their trace presence . <PARA> “ it ’ s now almost 2019 ,” fraser wrote in a 1 december 2018 update to her post , “ and seeing as how these studies were conducted over four years ago , it is hard to say whether they have changed up the pesticides they are using , or whether they have stopped using them at all .” we concur .",2018-12-04T00:58:06+00:00,test_88,test,misinfo

( the mercalli scale is a measurement derived from observable earthquake damage ; the richter scale is based on seismometer readings . the mercalli scale is thus largely a subjective measurement , while the richter scale is generally considered to be more objective and scientifically accurate .) parts of santa monica and the san fernando valley experienced mercalli ix - level intensity , which was <MASK> on the fax as a 9 - level richter scale measurement ( instead of the officially reported 6 . 7 ). <PARA> caltech ( actually the u . s . geological survey at caltech ) had not under - reported the figure — the northridge quake was a 6 . 7 no matter who measured it . earthquake data is almost instantaneously shared among a number of organizations worldwide , and one group ’ s under - reporting the magnitude would have been quickly picked up by the others . even if caltech had wanted to suppress the real numbers , it would have been unable to do so without the cooperation of a number of other scientific organizations . <PARA> the scary fax played into what people wanted to believe . those who ’ d lived through the quake swore it had to have been much stronger than the 6 . 7 that was being reported . from this belief was the legend born : if <MORE> it did for reasons other than just the usual mistrust of government and science that marks such whispers . getting up close and personal with the unthinkable heightens the experience , which explains in part why this legend was so widely believed by los angeleans : they ’ d been shaken out of bed and back to reality by this earthquake , whereas they had experienced other large quakes that had taken place in other lands merely as words on a page or images on a television screen . in a world where the ruin of the 6 . 9 kobe quake ( 17 january 1995 ) was dispassionately presented by the nightly news and barely given a second thought here in california , what the authorities were telling skeptical los angeleans was a 6 . 7 felt like it was more because it had been experienced with all our senses , not just the television - dulled ones . <PARA> there was yet another reason for this legend ’ s running rampant : its location . the quake ’ s epicenter was in the heart of the san fernando valley , a heavily - populated area , and so felt stronger to many people because those who experienced the sensation were right on top of the worst of it . additionally , we humans have a desire to star ourselves in the drama of the moment . a 6 . 7 didn ’ t sound worthy of the harrowing experience endured by those resident on 17 january 1994 , and those who ’ d been through the shake and looked to regale others with their horrific accounts were especially receptive to any suggestion that the figure was far too low . <PARA> on a final note , one further <MASK> attached to fema in california : that illegal immigrants who surfaced to apply for disaster relief would be rounded up , handed over to ins , and deported . that <MASK> did not begin with the northridge quake , however ; it was recorded in the aftermath of the 17 october 1989 loma prieta earthquake in the san francisco area . <PARA> while fema ’ s aid is now available only to u . s . citizens , legal residents of the u . s ., and the resident parents of u . s . citizens ( that is , children born in the usa ), at the time of the loma prieta quake , the assistance it directed was available to citizens and non - citizens alike . as for alerting the ins to potential illegals , fema pointed out at that time that it didn ’ t ask about the citizenship <MASK> of aid applicants , with questions about citizenship <MASK> not even being presented on any of its forms .

<PARA> that is the question that has been posited across the u . s . from time to time as <MASK> about “ sex bracelets ” spread from news market to news market . according to the whispers , the colorful jelly bracelets so beloved of grade - and middle - schoolers convey sexual intent and are used to arrange liaisons of an adult nature . <PARA> jelly bracelets are thin rubbery bands which can be worn — singly or interconnected — on the wrists , ankles , or around the neck . they are available in an array of colors , and about $ 3 buys a pack of fifteen , making them <PARA> one of the more reasonably - priced fad items to come along lately . the bands initially acquired sartorial cachet in the 1980s when madonna was seen sporting them , but fashion has its ebbs and flows , so that level of popularity was not maintained and the bracelets lost their appeal for a time . in the late 1990s the bracelets came back into vogue , and they have gained additional <MASK> in the 2000s as everything 80s has become cool again and new pop stars like avril lavigne and pink are seen wearing these baubles . <PARA> recent years have seen several occurrences of administrators in elementary and middle schools banning or warning against the wearing of jelly bracelets by students : <PARA> officials at each of these schools have taken this stance not because the acts signified by various colors are being carried out , but to protect children from premature sexualization . nothing in the various “ sex bracelet ” news stories we ’ ve pawed through indicates girls are actually using these fashion items to declare willingness to engage in various acts , or that boys are breaking girls ’ bracelets in the belief that so doing grants them a right to <MASK> what they think has been advertised . rather , the bannings <MORE> leaving them to preserve a particular view of themselves . the concept of being required to have sex would hold certain appeal because such obligation would take the decision out of their hands . the notion that a “ sex coupon ” could compel them to act out their desires gives them a way to vicariously explore lust while at the same time remaining a “ good girl ” in that there is no admission ( internal or otherwise ) of sexual hankerings . <PARA> the parents of thirty years ago were not going batty over “ sex coupons ” the way today ’ s parents are over “ sex bracelets ” because they hadn ’ t heard about them . ignorance of their children ’ s wacky belief cushioned them in a way that is no longer possible in our current media - saturated world . while it is <MASK> kids of the new millennium have a harder time holding on to their innocence , so too do their parents . <PARA> since we published our <MASK> <MASK> in 2003 , we ’ ve heard from hundreds of readers on this topic . the adults who write almost always say their kids are never going to wear those bracelets again ; on the other hand , almost without exception , the middle - and high - school kids from all across the u . s . express shock that adults would think they were actually obeying this “ code ” and disappointment that their elders fail to understand the bracelets are no more than a cool fashion accessory that has attracted a silly <MASK> . yes , many kids had heard the <MASK> before the media threw it at them ( and many hadn ’ t ), but even those exposed to this snippet of lore in the wild ( i . e ., those who heard it from their friends as an item of schoolyard lore rather than gleaned it from the headlines of the day ) received it as nothing more than a giddy “ everybody knows ” fact , right up there with “ bubble yum contains spider eggs .” ( the mechanics of the activity alone might well rule it out : as many of our correspondents have noted , it would take a mighty force to break a jelly bracelet — those circlets are tough . <PARA> the greatest concern over “ sex bracelets ” appears not to be that anyone is going to engage in any real redeeming , but that children far too young to be entertaining such thoughts are being exposed to them . one way the pull tab and beer label beliefs differ from the “ sex bracelets ” code is the age of the participants ; the <MASK> of thirty years ago was circulated mainly in high schools , but today ’ s version is moving through grade and middle schools . <PARA> barbara “ youth marketed ” mikkelson",2014-04-01T03:07:40+00:00,train_1676,train,misinfo

new york ), was forced to resign from the u . s . house of representatives due to a sexting scandal , and in 2016 when she was thrust into the limelight by an fbi investigation into hillary clinton ’ s use of a private e - mail server while at the <MASK> department . as clinton was running for president at the time , abedin became the target of partisan attacks aimed at weakening her employer ’ s candidacy . <PARA> on 24 october 2016 , an eight - and - a - half - minute video was uploaded to the highly - trafficked youtube channel “ anonymous ” purporting to prove that huma abedin , estranged wife of disgraced former congressman anthony weiner and longtime aide to democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton , has “ undeniable ties to terrorists and 9 / 11 funders .” it accrued more than 2 million views in under a week , resulting in a flash - flood of queries about it to our inbox . <PARA> neither the video nor its content was new , however , nor were they created by the hacktivist group anonymous . the video was <MASK> posted on 11 september 2016 to a youtube channel called “ leaked uploads .” it , in turn , closely follows the text of an <MASK> posted approximately 10 days before that in a subreddit populated by donald trump supporters . both the text and video appear to have been created by the same individual , a user who goes by the handle “ invadepro .” <PARA> here is an excerpt from the text : <PARA> as we mentioned above , none of these allegations are new . we ’ ll review the main charges , beginning with abedin ’ s biographical information , in a moment , but it ’ s worth pointing out at the outset that before she could serve as hillary clinton ’ s deputy chief of staff at the <MASK> department , abedin underwent a security clearance requiring , among other things , vetting of her personal and professional <MASK> to establish her loyalty to the united <MASK> and “ freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion .” while we would not argue that the clearance process is infallible , nor that information could not subsequently come to light that might change the assessment , we think it likely that the investigators charged with the task have better research tools available to them than does the average internet user . <PARA> it ’ s <MASK> that huma abedin was born in kalamazoo , michigan <MORE> is a misrepresentation , according to sources interviewed for a 25 august 2016 <MASK> in the washington post : <PARA> in point of fact , huma abedin never literally worked at the journal of muslim affairs at all , according to a spokesperson for the clinton campaign , who said she was “ just a figurehead and not actually on staff .” <PARA> the video attempts to link the abedin family to terrorism via their connection with abdullah omar naseef , a saudi arabian professor who was also secretary - general of the muslim world league between 1982 and 1992 . naseef , who worked ( and still works ) at the same university where syed abedin taught , helped launch the institute of muslim minority affairs , and for a time sat on the advisory board of the journal . the video provides no <MASK> that abdullah omar naseef “ funded al - qaeda ” or any other terror groups , however . it simply asserts that he did based on his authorization of a refugee relief fund in 1988 that later developed ties with al - qaeda . the washington post explains : <PARA> another dubious connection cited in the video is huma abedin ’ s membership in the muslim student association while she attended george washington university . as it happens , two years after abedin graduated and left the university , a young man named anwar al - awlaki arrived , joined that same muslim student association , and served as a school chaplain . al - awlaki , you may recall , was later identified as an al - qaeda recruiter and killed in a u . s . drone strike in 2011 . but the fact that each of them belonged , at different times , to the same campus religious organization does not mean they have anything in common other than being muslim . <PARA> the video also links the national muslim student association to the muslim brotherhood , but apart from the fact that the latter helped establish the former more than 50 years ago , the <MASK> that the two organizations are actively affiliated isn ’ t supported by <MASK> . <PARA> most of these allegations first surfaced in 2012 , when michele bachmann and other conservative republicans launched a campaign denouncing “ muslim extremists ” — huma adebin among them — who had supposedly infiltrated the u . s . government . the backlash against these unfounded charges transcended partisanship . among those who condemned bachmann ’ s characterization of abedin was then -

1,"misinformation spread on the internet in the wake of a rally in portland , oregon , where far - right protesters clashed with counter - demonstrators — violence that has become a reoccurring feature of the political landscape in the pacific northwest . <PARA> the far - right groups , patriot prayer and “ him too ,” held demonstrations on june 29 , 2019 , in downtown portland and were met by counter - protesters , including black - clad anti - fascists . as they have in the past , the events devolved into a series of street brawls . three people were arrested and eight people were injured , including three who were sent to the hospital , according to police . <PARA> right - leaning social media personalities and websites widely circulated an image of a bearded man with blood covering his face , identifying him as john blum and reporting that blum was the victim of a brutal attack by “ antifa criminals .” partisan media and a single picture didn ’ t tell the full <MASK> , though . <PARA> blum was hit in the head by a black - clad protester , and that injury caused bleeding . but after a widely shared narrative that he was heroically trying to help someone emerged , so did video showing that blum ( wearing a fedora hat ) was both carrying a baton and proactively engaged in a fight . <PARA> the man who shot the videos asked us to use only his first name , john , because of harassment directed at journalists who covered the event . john told us that in the chaos that has periodically roiled portland since the election of president donald trump , some people show up specifically to fight , and the late - june protests were no different . blum had swung his baton at people before getting hit over the head himself . <PARA> “ it was just really chaotic ,” john told us . “ there was a point where things had calmed down , and then someone threw one more punch , and it turned into another little scuffle . that ’ s when the older gentleman ( blum ) came at people who weren ’ t attacking him , i think two different people in the black bloc . someone responded by hitting him in the head [ from behind ].” <PARA> john , who identifies himself as an independent media worker sympathetic to the anti - fascists ’ cause , said that a sundress - wearing protester was attacked , but blum was not part of that altercation . “ it ’ s really kind of nuanced and mixed up . the idea that john blum was sticking up for this guy [ in a sundress ] is inaccurate , but there was an attempted attack on [ the person in the sundress ]. john blum was not part of that confrontation .” <MORE> though we are unsure why . we were also unable to locate blum online for comment . <PARA> the misleading victim framework that spread across the right - leaning media ecosystem is no surprise , said stanislav vysotsky , an assistant professor of sociology and criminology at the university of wisconsin at whitewater who has been researching political violence in portland . citing the work of sociologist mitch berbrier , vysotsky told us the “ victim ” narrative is an established framing technique used on the far right . <PARA> “ there is already a master narrative on the far right that they are victims , victims of people of color , of jewish conspiracies , feminists , all these things , so it ’ s very easy once you have this framework to paint yourself as a victim of left - wing thugs ,” he told us . <PARA> reality is more complicated , however . he places the most significant starting point for political violence in portland with a june 4 , 2017 , “ free speech ” rally planned by right - wing patriot prayer founder joey gibson one week after two men were fatally stabbed on a portland train by a white supremacist . the men had been trying to intervene as that white supremacist , identified as jeremy christian , berated two muslim passengers . the rally was scheduled despite the revelation that christian had attended a patriot prayer event , raising tensions . <PARA> since then , multiple incidents have contributed to an overall escalation of violence at various events staged by far - right activists , which draw opposition from counter - demonstrators , including anti - fascists . on may 1 , 2019 , members of the patriot prayer group showed up at cider riot , a bar in portland known to have left - leaning activists as patrons , and sprayed customers with mace , initiating a street fight . one member of gibson ’ s group hit a woman with a baton , fracturing a vertebrae , according a lawsuit filed by the bar . <PARA> also in 2017 , vysotsky said , the far - right adopted a new tactic of holding political events in liberal strongholds like seattle and portland to deliberately provoke a response . “ that was a shift in the politics of the far right , and this influence of the alt - right and the trolling culture . the protests became increasingly trolling events , where they are coming into the liberal territory basically saying , ‘ we ’ re far right , and we ’ re coming into your city , what are you gonna do about it ?'” <PARA> according to the anti - defamation league , “ both patriot prayer and proud boys espouse virulently anti - muslim views , are vocally pro - trump , and are known for their deliberate provocations of left - leaning west coast communities .”",2019-07-03 21:11:45+00:00,test_175,test,misinfo

1,"<MASK> : exactly who wrote this evocative and well - crafted letter chiding president clinton for calling on older generations to “ learn sacrifice as other generations have done ” remains a mystery . it has appeared in the print media , on the radio , and throughout the internet in several variant forms , credited to a variety of writers . the version most frequently cited on the internet is attributed to a retired air force lt . colonel from colorado springs named robert j . grady and reportedly ran in the ( now defunct ) public intelligence review and newsletter on 30 july 1994 . it also appeared in st . petersburg times in 1996 , where it was credited to otho e . hays of clearwater , florida ; was printed in the cleveland plain dealer ( also in 1996 ) under the name of kitty dowdell ; and was awarded the december 1997 “ letter of the month ” honor by the seattle times , who cited its author as one joe regan of kirkland . even stranger , the letter was reportedly read by actor charlton heston on rush limbaugh ’ s radio show on 31 may 1994 , before its earliest known <PARA> publication . <PARA> whoever its author , this letter is a heady reminder that previous generations endured times of hardship and crisis that those of us who have enjoyed only an era of economic booms and peaceful security find it hard to imagine .

person voter impersonation , even though examples of this kind of fraud are extremely rare . <PARA> thus , it appears to be highly unlikely that the information on a fake license would match exactly with all the other information the government has on file for individuals . <PARA> the above <MASK> posited that these fake licenses would result in millions of votes for democrats through mail -

<PARA> yes , as to affecting the treasury ’ s cash flow ( but only temporarily ), and no , as to deepening the national debt . social security administration economist david pattison explains : <PARA> <MASK> : social security has a $ 2 . 5 trillion surplus . <PARA> <MASK> , and then some . as of 2017 , social security trust fund reserves stood at $ 2 . 82 trillion , up $ 19 billion from the previous year . in the absence of reforms , the trustees expect to maintain surpluses , albeit gradually declining , through 2034 . <PARA> <MASK> : congress has “ borrowed ” trillions from social security to pay for government spending . <PARA> <MASK> , but misleadingly <MASK> . as we explained above , the system was set up from day one such that trust fund surpluses must be invested in interest - earning u . s . treasury bonds , in effect lending the monies to the general account for whatever discretionary uses congress sees fit to spend them on . one might argue that there are more practical alternatives , but it ’ s misleading to characterize it as an abuse of the system . <PARA> are members of the gop “ lying ,” as the facebook meme holds , when they say social security needs to be cut in order to balance the federal budget ? not necessarily , but they ’ re painting a distorted picture , purposely or not . in the short term , and minus the implementation of other reforms , cutting social security benefits would only add to the trust funds ’ surpluses while cheating beneficiaries of the assistance they ’ ve been promised . it wouldn ’ t add to the federal budget ’ s bottom line . <PARA> without question , changes of some kind will be necessary to keep social security viable decades hence , so there ’ s no way around the government “ messing ” with the system to that end , one way or another .",2017-07-07T07:17:00+00:00,train_1247,train,misinfo

and that scientists think scopex itself could produce global unintended consequences . <PARA> such assertions or implications are misleading in several regards described in detail below . briefly , it is <MASK> that gates has funded research that includes theoretical studies into the feasibility of solar radiation management . scopex is one of those projects . it is , however , a mischaracterization to suggest that scopex seeks to test geoengineering per se , that a geoengineered world is a desired outcome for the people involved in the project , or that scopex itself could disturb the global climate system . <PARA> the ultimate point of scopex project is not to dim anything — scientists do not need to test whether aerosols block sunlight , that fact is already well established — but instead to release a small amount of the calcium carbonate ( no more than 4 . 4 pounds ) into the wake of a propeller - driven weather balloon flying 12 miles above the arctic , creating a diffuse cloud that is roughly 1000 yards long and 100 yards in diameter . <PARA> the data gathered during this experiment would , among other things , help inform computer models that look into the potential risks of actual geoengineering . these models , the scopex website explains , “ are the primary tool for estimating the risks and benefits of solar geoengineering .” to refine these models , scientists need to know how the aerosols interact with the atmosphere on a nanoscale . according to the project ’ s website : <PARA> in 2007 , gates created a grant - making research fund known as <MORE> slippery - slope arguments aside , this is a far cry from an attempt to geoengineer the world . <PARA> many anti - gates stories and memes suggest gates philanthropic efforts ’ stem from things he “ wants ” to happen . in terms of solar radiation management , that is not the case . gates argument , as described during a 2010 ted talk , is that humanity should not be in a position , if global warming gets bad enough that geoengineering needs to be taken seriously , where we do not have the research to fully understand the mechanics of that solution : <PARA> as keutsch has pointed out , this is not a fringe view , it is one held by several scientific bodies . in 2015 , the national academies of sciences , for example , released a two - part report on climate interventions like solar radiation management . “ if the world cannot slow emissions or the effects of climate change are more extreme or occur sooner than expected , there may be demands to pursue additional climate - intervention technologies about which scientists need a better understanding ,” national academy of sciences president ralph j . cicerone said in a news release for that report .“ although riskier ideas to lessen the amount of energy absorbed from the sun should not be considered for deployment , they should be studied so that we can provide answers if someday these ideas begin to be considered in attempts to avert catastrophe .” <PARA> the incremental nature of scopex cannot be <MASK> . the only reason the experiment was in the news in december 2020 , for instance , is because the project found a company to facilitate the launch of a weather balloon . but even this flight — still months away and pending approval from harvard ’ s outside advisory committee — is only a test of the balloon , and would not release its theoretical payload of just under 3 1 / 2 pounds of calcium carbonate powder . <PARA> further , a diffuse cloud of chalky powder gently perturbed by a propeller - driven weather balloon 12 miles above the arctic is in no way capable of altering the global climate system . headlines or <MASK> to the contrary rely on “ slippery slope ” arguments about geoengineering in general , not a fear that scopex itself could destroy the world . <PARA> while gates is one of geoengineering research ’ s most significant ( at least in financial terms ) champions , his funding of this research does not stem from a desire to implement so - called “ last - ditch ” solutions . for these reasons , and because scopex does not — from a factual standpoint — actually dim or block the sun , we rate the <MASK> that gates is funding research that “ would help block out the sun ” as “ mostly <MASK> .”",2021-01-05 22:23:57+00:00,test_1353,test,misinfo

1,"commonly known as “ aids mary ” or “ aids harry ,” this legend came into prominence in late 1986 and was as much an expression of the fears of that time as anything else . though aids had been with us for years before that , it was only in the late 1980s that heterosexuals began to wake up to this grim reaper walking among them , not just their gay siblings : <PARA> ( a related legend has it that madmen attack the unsuspecting with aids - tainted needles . see our pin prick attacks page for more on this related myth .) <PARA> when the “ aids mary ” legend began spreading , aids was a fearsome disease : once hiv - positive , the infected lived under a death sentence . that alone would frighten anyone , but tie this deadly disease to the usual apprehensions about sex with anyone ( let alone strangers ), and a cautionary urban legend results . <PARA> the legend speaks to our fears ; as such , it ’ s larger than life , complete with shocking messages of impending death callously delivered . in the “ aids mary ” version ( woman infects man ), a fellow picks up a young lady for a one - night sexual encounter . everything goes swimmingly , and he ’ s quite pleased about the whole thing , until the next morning when he awakens to find her gone and the words “ welcome to the world of aids ” scrawled in lipstick on his bathroom mirror . <PARA> the “ aids harry ” version ( man infects woman ) usually features a romance of some duration taking place in a faraway place . the depraved infector passes along his good news by way of a gift , which he asks his victim to unwrap once she ’ s on the plane home . depending upon where you hear this <MASK> , the gift will be a minature coffin ( ceramic or wooden ) or a coffee mug . whichever item it is , it will invariably be emblazoned with the message “ welcome to the world of aids .” <PARA> often given as the reason for the infector ’ s rampage through the ranks of the previously untouched is the justification of his or her having caught the disease from a member of the opposite sex — now the entire gender will be made to pay . this cautionary tale warns against the dangers of promiscuity , but it also brings into play the fear of falling prey to a random act of violence at the hands of a madman . <PARA> there have been actual cases of the hiv - infected engaging in unprotected sex without first informing their partners of their condition . in the largest documented case of its kind , darnell “ boss man ” mcgee infected at least 18 women and girls . mcgee , 28 <MORE> congregation with the tale of an hiv - positive woman who had slept with up to 80 young men across four southern irish counties in a deliberate attempt to infect as many as possible with the deadly aids virus . the priest said he had personally traced about 25 of the men , and that five had tested positive for hiv . scary stuff indeed , and who would doubt the word of a priest ? <PARA> months went by , and although parishioners continued to take the roman - collared vector ’ s word as gospel , health officials could find nothing to substantiate the priest ’ s <MASK> . indeed , speaking to his credibility , a follow - up <MASK> about this man made mention of another improbable tale he was now spreading : <PARA> in other words , this is one yarn spinner of a holy man . <PARA> at least one criminal tried to use the gist of the ‘ aids mary ’ legend as part of his legal defense . in his trial for the 1990 murder of linda hoberg , jeffrey hengehold <MASK> he ’ d met the victim in a bar and had sex with her later that night ; as they were parting , she said , “ welcome to the world of aids .” he then proceeded to beat her to death . <PARA> though hengehold <MASK> this was his motive for the murder , there was no <MASK> to prove it one way or the other . hengehold had cremated hoberg ’ s body , making it impossible to determine if she ’ d had aids , and he himself never tested positive for hiv . <PARA> the laws of most countries are inadequate when it comes to assessing and penalizing the crime of knowingly transmitting a deadly disease , but at least one of them is moving in the right direction . britain is even now trying to reform laws to cover this form of assault . changes are in the works that would result in an hiv - infected person who tried to pass on the virus out of malice being charged with grievous bodily harm with intent , and those who simply failed to take proper precautions charged under the lesser offence of causing grievous bodily harm . <PARA> sightings : scary legends also make great movie plots , so it should come as no surprise this legend showed up as the plot of the 1992 german movie via appia .

( and their staffs paled beside those of lady bird johnson and betty ford , each of whom had around 30 employees , and jackie kennedy , who reportedly had about 40 .) <PARA> things get more complicated when it comes to melania trump . for one thing , she didn ’ t move into the white house until 11 june 2017 , five months into her husband ’ s presidency . for another , she was far less active during her inaugural year as first lady than her immediate predecessors . <PARA> does melania trump have a smaller staff than michelle obama ? yes , but the disparity is smaller than alleged . the <MASK> that she only has four staff members is based on the 2017 annual report to congress on white house office personnel . that report does list exactly four staff members whose titles link them directly to the first lady , but it is neither a full nor a current count , for the following reasons : <PARA> first , the report was published on 1 july 2017 , only slightly more than two weeks after melania trump moved into the east wing . her staff was skeletal then , at best . <PARA> second , if we apply the same criteria used to arrive at a count of michelle obama ’ s staff , at least two employees who aren ’ t directly linked to the first lady by title must also be included : special assistant to the president / white house social secretary , and deputy social secretary . those positions alone bring the total size of melania trump ’ s staff in her first two weeks in the white house to six . <PARA> lastly , for whatever reasons , the annual reports to congress don ’ t list the first lady ’ s entire staff . for example , in january 2018 melania hired three new employees , but only one of those is accounted for in the 1 july 2018 report . <PARA> <MASK> made to the press by the first lady ’ s communications director , stephanie grisham ( who did not respond to our request for an updated list ), indicated melania trump ’ s staff numbered nine employees as of october 2017 . her three new hires in january 2018 would have brought that total to 12 staffers — a total still lower than michelle obama ’ s , but triple the mere four <MASK> of her . <PARA> the meme under discussion , therefore , deploys inaccurate numbers and misleading comparisons to portray the trumps as “ givers ” and the obamas as “ takers .”",2018-07-08T15:39:06+00:00,train_5332,train,misinfo

0,"<MASK> : if you <PARA> have lived as an adult in the same area where you grew up , chances are you can recall at least a few fondly - remembered local landmarks of your childhood that no longer exist — places or things that had special significance for you ( if only in their familiarity ) that have since been removed , replaced , or destroyed . they might be landmarks as considerable as a house you lived in , a school you attended , or a restaurant you frequented , or as unremarkable as a street sign , a water tank , or a tree . <PARA> one such memory of mine is a rather unusual one . it involves a landmark that lasted only a few days before being destroyed ; a landmark i never saw and was too young to be aware of during its short lifespan . nonetheless , i grew up hearing the folklore of how it came to be and what happened to it , and studying the tantalizing remnant of its brief existence . <PARA> the landmark of which i speak was the infamous pink lady , a 60 - foot tall drawing of a naked woman which mysteriously appeared overnight on a sheer rock cliff above a tunnel on malibu canyon road ( one of several canyon passageways through the santa monica mountains connecting the northwest portion of los angeles county to the pacific coast ) in october 1966 : <PARA> the pink lady was the handiwork of lynne seemayer ( now lynne westmore ), a 31 - year - old secretary from northridge , california . motivated in part by the ugly graffiti adorning the rocks above and around a tunnel four miles north of malibu — “[ t ] he tunnel was an eyesore ,” she said . “ if someone was going to that trouble , why not do something creative ?” — ms . seemayer spent several months planning her art project and preparing her “ canvas .” starting in january 1966 , she whiled away several nights each month ( on evenings when the full moon provided adequate light ) climbing the cliff and , tethered by nylon ropes , erasing the graffiti . finally , by august 1966 , the cliff face was sufficiently graffiti - free for her to sketch an outline of her planned drawing , which remained undisturbed ( and largely unnoticed ) for another two months . ( she had <MASK> hoped to draw a bird , but after she realized that its wings would be obstructed by brush she opted for the more vertical figure of a woman instead .) <PARA> finally , at 8 : 00 pm on friday , 28 october 1966 ( another moonlit night ), seemayer began her final assault on the <PARA> cliff with brushes and paint cans . by dawn , she had completed her work : a 60 - foot - tall painting <MORE> . “ one woman accused me of all the rapes that had been committed , that the pink lady brought out the lust in men .” <PARA> westmore changed her telephone number , but the calls kept coming . finally , the stress was too much , and she was hospitalized with pneumonia and lost her job as a legal secretary . but even in the hospital she wasn ’ t immune from attention . <PARA> “ this nurse came in , wanting me to sign something ,” westmore recalled . “ i thought it was for some kind of medical work , but she wanted an autograph .” <PARA> another woman called westmore every other night for two months , contending that the pink lady was an exact portrait of her young daughter who ran away from home . <PARA> “ she thought i had used her daughter as a model ,” westmore said . “ it was so pathetic . she was so convinced .” westmore received hate mail <PARA> from people offended by the nude portrait , including one letter from someone threatening to tar and feather her and her two children and dump them off at sunset boulevard . she turned the letter over to the fbi . <PARA> she received pictures of men masturbating . an arts group asked her to judge pictures that apes had painted . <PARA> “ it was too crazy ,” she said . “ one woman accused me of all the rapes that had been committed , that the pink lady brought out the lust in men .” <PARA> westmore changed her telephone number , but the calls kept coming . finally , the stress was too much , and she was hospitalized with pneumonia and lost her job as a legal secretary . but even in the hospital she wasn ’ t immune from attention . <PARA> “ this nurse came in , wanting me to sign something ,” westmore recalled . “ i thought it was for some kind of medical work , but she wanted an autograph .” <PARA> in the end , a sad result for a woman who had not sought to make a monetary profit or a grand political <MASK> , but who had simply felt the urge to create a piece of art — to “ do something that was [ her ] own .” ( lynne seemayer professed surprise at the controversy her pink lady created ; she had even left a rope at the site so that she could go back and touch up her work later .) <PARA> i never saw the unobscured version of the pink lady myself . my childhood landmark was an enigmatic and impenetrable blur that marked the spot where something of interest had once stood , augmented by the often inaccurate and embellished memories of those who knew the pink lady during her brief lifetime . somehow that made her all the more intriguing .",2013-05-18T13:03:28+00:00,train_5442,train,info

era rum runner named bill mccoy , even if the booze he had been vending had been of the highest quality , he could not have been the mccoy celebrated in the saying , given that the line has been documented back to 1908 , whereas prohibition did not begin in the u . s . until 1920 . <PARA> for the saying to not only have taken root but survived for more than a century , it had to have caught the public ’ s imagination in its infancy rather than been merely a catchphrase within a small specialized area . a phrase first recorded as used in reference to whisky in 1856 then enshrined as a particular brand of firewater ’ s official slogan in 1870 fits the bill in ways the other proffered explanations do not , especially if it were given a further boost via being confused with the nickname of a well -

0,"on 30 july 2017 , the conservative truth division web site reported that the united <MASK> ’ national debt had fallen to a “ surprising ” extent in the seven months since the inauguration of president donald trump : <PARA> we have checked these numbers and set them in context , and found that the national debt did indeed fall by $ 102 billion between 20 january and the end of july 2017 . this decline is also historically remarkable , in both absolute and percentage terms . this six - month fall in the national debt is also significant when measured against the size of the overall economy . <PARA> national debt — the basics <PARA> the national debt is , in brief , the total value of what the federal government owes , and is made up of accumulated annual deficits ( when the government spends more than it receives in taxes and other income ). it is made up of “ public debt ” and “ intragovernmental holdings .” public debt is , essentially , debt held by sources outside the central government . intragovernmental holdings are debts between agencies within the federal government , in the form of government trust funds , such as social security trust funds . <PARA> national debt — the numbers <PARA> according to figures published by the treasury department ’ s bureau of fiscal services on the treasurydirect web site , the national debt was $ 19 . 84 trillion on 27 july 2017 ( not 30 july , as <MASK> by truth division . on 20 january , it was $ 19 . 95 trillion . <PARA> that shows a fall of $ 102 . 37 billion , or 0 . 51 percent , over a period of 131 business days . to set that in context , we analyzed national debt data stretching back to 12 july 1993 , and examined every 131 - day period in the last 24 years . you can download a spreadsheet containing all the relevant data here . <PARA> debt - to - gdp ratio <PARA> the national debt , however , is best viewed with reference to the overall economy . if two countries have about the same national debt , the one with the smaller economy will likely be more constrained in its spending , whereas the larger economy — despite having the same level of debt — will be less affected in terms of economic and fiscal policy . <PARA> a good way of checking this is to compare the size of the debt to the size of the economy , measured as gdp ( gross domestic product ). gdp is the combined market value of all goods and services produced in a given jurisdiction ( in this case , the united <MASK> ). this comparison between the size of the national debt and the size of the economy is known as the debt - to - gdp ratio . <MORE> this spreadsheet , but here ’ s what our estimates revealed : <PARA> causes <PARA> the truth division , a conservative , openly pro - trump web site , clearly attributes this decline in the national debt to the president , <MASK> he and his administration are “ undoing the government ’ s rampant spending ” and “ keeping his promises regarding fiscal responsibility ”. however , the <MASK> does not cite any examples of actions taken by donald trump which would support this conclusion . <PARA> jared bernstein , a senior fellow at the center on budget and policy priorities and former economic adviser to vice president joe biden , dismissed any <MASK> that president trump is responsible : <PARA> instead , bernstein told us , the cause of the drop in the debt is simple — the federal debt ceiling that has been in place since march 2017 . <PARA> eventually , bernstein says , the debt ceiling will have to be lifted , and the payments that had been delayed will cause the national debt to increase once again . <PARA> that pattern can be seen in this chart , which shows the national debt from january 2011 up to the end of july 2017 . there are four flat lines showing four periods during which the debt ceiling was frozen : from may to august 2011 ; may to october 2013 ; march to october 2015 ; and the ongoing period since march 2017 . <PARA> conclusion <PARA> the truth division <MASK> accurately describes the extent to which the national debt fell between the inauguration of donald trump in january 2017 and the end of july of the same year . and it rightly describes this fall as “ surprising ”, since it ranks among the very largest 131 - day declines in the national debt since july 1993 , both in absolute and percentage terms . <PARA> similarly , the decline in both components of the national debt — public debt and intragovernmental holdings — was highly significant between 20 january and 27 july 2017 , both in absolute and percentage terms , and as we have shown , the national debt has fallen by an estimated 2 . 25 percent since inauguration day — even when measured against the size of the overall unites <MASK> economy . whether or not any actions or decisions made by donald trump have caused or contributed to these historically remarkable declines in the debt is a question that goes beyond the scope of this particular fact check . <PARA> unfortunately , the national debt resumed its upward march in august 2017 and by mid - august 2018 stood at about $ 21 . 3 trillion ( up $ 1 . 4 trillion since inauguration day ), so the early 2017 drop has not proved to be a long - term trend . <PARA> a spreadsheet containing all the data relevant to this <MASK> can be downloaded here .",2017-08-14T21:19:51+00:00,train_5388,train,info

[ emphasis added ].” <PARA> in those tweets , trump clearly indicated that continued federal financial assistance to california ( specifically to newsom ) would be contingent upon <MASK> officials changing their approach to forest management . that constituted a threat to withdraw federal aid to california for wildfires , and newsweek was right to describe it as such . <PARA> in august 2019 , the russian government published a <MASK> about a phone call between trump and putin on july 31 . that <MASK> read as follows : <PARA> “ vladimir putin had a telephone conversation with us president donald trump this evening at the american side ’ s initiative . the us president offered help in putting out wildfires in siberia . the president of russia expressed sincere gratitude for the kind attention and the offer of help and assistance . vladimir putin said he will accept the offer if it becomes necessary . he also told his american colleague that a powerful group of aircraft had been formed in siberia to fight the wildfires . according to the emergencies ministry , solutions have been found to problems with the refuelling and deployment of airplanes and helicopters . <PARA> “ the president of russia regards the us president ’ s offer as a sign that it is possible that full - scale bilateral relations will be restored in the future . the presidents of russia and the united <MASK> agreed to continue contacts in the form of telephone conversations as well as personal meetings .” <PARA> we asked the white house whether they could corroborate , even broadly , the russian government ’ s characterization of the call . unfortunately , we did not receive a response . <PARA> at the time , a white house spokesperson did not contradict that version of events and told news outlets that , during his conversation with putin , trump had “ expressed concern over the vast wildfires afflicting siberia .” this characterization , combined with the russian description of an offer to help , means it ’ s perfectly plausible that trump did make such an offer . <PARA> we found confirmation that he did in a video of an aug . 1 press conference during which trump said the following when reporters asked him about the phone call : <PARA> “ mostly we discussed the forest fires in siberia , and other parts of russia . and i said , look , we have the greatest equipment , if we could help you let us know . large sections are burning , and so i said to president putin , if we can help you , let me know .”",2019-11-06 21:28:39+00:00,test_635,test,info

1,"in the spring of 2018 , president donald trump announced he would be imposing tariffs on more than 1 , 300 types of products imported from china . the move brought significant scrutiny , including <MASK> that clothing had been excluded from the list of taxed products in order to benefit the president ’ s daughter and adviser ivanka trump , whose clothing line has in the past sold products manufactured in china . ( a few months later , ivanka trump said she would be closing down her clothing company .) <PARA> in july 2018 , various news accounts reported that in anticipation of the implementation of those tariffs , customers in the united <MASK> and elsewhere were ramping up their orders for one chinese - made product in particular : president trump re - election campaign items . <PARA> the reports gave rise to speculation that not only was the president ’ s re - election campaign itself ordering campaign items produced in china rather than in the u . s ., but that they were attempting to mitigate against the increased costs that would come with the tariffs by pushing for the quick completion of those materials — moves that would provide a double dose of irony for a politician who has famously emphasized prioritizing american jobs and manufacturing . <PARA> some news reports contained ambiguous phrasing which created the impression ( without explicitly <MASK> such ) that the trump campaign had ordered the production of chinese - made campaign flags . for example , the new york post described materials being manufactured in chinese factories as “ trump ’ s re - election banners ,” while usa today called them “ trump ’ s 2020 banners .” <PARA> elle magazine similarly described the merchandise as “ trump ’ s 2020 re - election flags ,” while adding a <MASK> about the identity of the customer who actually ordered them : “ while it is not confirmed that trump ’ s campaign ordered the flags , who else besides sean spicer is really that hype about the dude ?” <PARA> on 27 july , vermont senator and 2016 presidential candidate bernie sanders was more direct and explicit in accusing both the president himself and his campaign of having ordered the chinese - made banners and flags . in a facebook post , sanders described the items as “ flags for president trump ’ s campaign ” and accused the president of ‘ opting for ’ cheap foreign labor : <PARA> trump 2020 merchandise — made in china <PARA> in a 3 july 2018 interview with national public radio ( npr ), li jiang , a factory owner in china ’ s zhejiang province , said that “ we also make flags for trump for 2020 ,” but this comment was ambiguous about whether the merchandise was ordered by the trump campaign itself . <PARA> on 19 july 2018 , the <MASK> - run chinese newspaper the global <MORE> had faced an increased volume of orders for flags bearing the campaign slogans “ trump 2020 ” and “ keep america great .” <PARA> both the reuters and agence france - presse ( afp ) news agencies reported on a fourth factory , this one in china ’ s anhui province , which had been pumping out trump 2020 flags and banners at a higher rate than usual , with reuters <MASK> a factory manager as <MASK> that her “ buyers are located in both china and abroad ” and that “ she doesn ’ t know if they are affiliated with trump ’ s official campaign or the republican party ”: <PARA> both reuters and afp included clear photographic and video <MASK> in their reports , so it ’ s clear that trump 2020 merchandise ordered by someone was being produced in at least one chinese factory as of july 2018 : <PARA> none of the chinese factory owners and managers <MASK> in the july 2018 news reports either affirmed or denied that the trump campaign itself had been responsible for the significant increase in orders in recent months , and none of them identified anyone else as being a major customer , so we do not know who was behind orders for the many thousands of “ trump 2020 ” flags produced in china in the first half of 2018 . <PARA> a trump campaign spokesperson firmly rejected any speculation or allegations linking the campaign to the merchandise . in a <MASK> sent to us by the trump 2020 campaign , michael glassner , chief operating officer of the donald j . trump for president committee , wrote : <PARA> we searched federal election commission records on spending by three trump - related political committees since 2017 and found no <MASK> of flags , banners , or other campaign merchandise being ordered from entities based in china . if such orders had been placed , it is possible that they may have been recorded as disbursements to third parties or subcontractors , but we found no <MASK> that this had taken place . <PARA> conclusion <PARA> it ’ s clear that trump 2020 merchandise is being produced in chinese factories , and it ’ s reasonable to conclude that the future implementation of tariffs on chinese imports has prompted something of a surge in orders , as recounted by several local factory officials . <PARA> the volume of the orders ( 90 , 000 banners between march and july , at just one factory ) is not inconsistent with the activities of a major u . s . presidential election campaign , and it is therefore reasonable to question the identity of the customer ( s ) behind such orders . however , we ’ ve so far found no concrete <MASK> documenting who is responsible for these orders : merchandisers , the trump campaign itself , republican partisans , foreign entities , or some combination thereof .",2018-07-28T00:26:46+00:00,train_3987,train,misinfo

1,"an image supposedly showing a meme that was posted to 2020 democratic u . s . presidential nominee joe biden ’ s facebook page featuring an endorsement from university of alabama ’ s football coach nick saban was circulated on social media in september 2020 : <PARA> this image first started circulating in april 2020 , when it was posted to college football trash talk nation , a facebook page that describes its content as a mix of “ memes , satirical <MASK> , trash talk and more .” while this image was <MASK> shared as a joke , it was recirculated on social media as if it were genuine after saban showed support for the black lives matter movement in august 2020 . <PARA> alabama . com reported : <PARA> as the black lives matter movement has received support from biden and various other liberal politicians , and condemnation from u . s . president donald trump and conservative politicians , saban ’ s involvement in this march was interpreted by some on social media as a tacit endorsement of biden . when purveyors of misinformation started to recirculate this meme , some were ready to believe that it was real . <PARA> but this image does not feature a genuine <MASK> from saban , nor does it show a genuine image that was shared by the biden campaign . this meme was created using a still from an advertisement saban did for aflac insurance : <PARA> it should also be noted that while saban did march against racial injustice , he has not officially endorsed biden for president . as far as we can tell , saban has not endorsed anyone for president in 2020 , and judging by his previous comments , he likely won ’ t be endorsing anyone soon . <PARA> in 2016 , saban explained why he didn ’ t endorse a candidate for president :",2020-09-03 19:58:24+00:00,test_537,test,misinfo
