        "text": "in the days before cable tv ( and the myriad other entertainments that have since sprung up to sap our attention ), the networks reigned supreme in the television industry . landing a series in the prime time line - up of one of the \u201c big three \u201d ( cbs , nbc , and abc ), where competition was fierce for the few slots that opened up each year , was a tv producer \u2019 s ultimate achievement . keeping his series on the air after having secured a network spot for it was a tv producer \u2019 s next greatest achievement . <PARA> it was with justifiable pride , then , that gene roddenberry found himself considering ways to enhance the popularity of his new star trek series in september 1966 . after years of planning and effort ( including the unusual circumstance of his having to produce two separate pilots with two different casts ), roddenberry had managed to convince nbc to take a chance on something outside the usual tried - and - <MASK> westerns and family sitcoms that dominated network schedules : a non - anthology science fiction series set on a space ship three hundred years in the future . <PARA> the chances of landing such a show with a network had been slim ; the chances of keeping it there were even slimmer . so it \u2019 s no wonder that after only two episodes of star trek had been aired , its creator / producer was already thinking ahead its next season . with an eye towards higher ratings , roddenberry wrote a memo to casting director joe d \u2019 agosta on 22 september 1966 which said : <PARA> if the wording and date of this memo are accurate , roddenberry was prescient indeed . by 22 september 1966 , the monkees ( which , like star trek , was never much a ratings winner during its <MASK> run ) had aired but two episodes , both of which had lost their time slot in the viewership contest to gilligan \u2019 s island . and \u201c last train to clarksville ,\u201d the monkees \u2019 first record , had yet to crack the top 40 on billboard \u2019 s singles chart . roddenberry must have been following the television industry ( and the teen market ) quite keenly to have caught on to davy jones \u2019 nascent popularity so quickly . <PARA> the new character roddenberry suggested did show up during star trek \u2018 s second season in 1967 - 68 in the person of an ensign serving as the ship \u2019 s navigator and junior science officer , as portrayed by actor walter koenig . the character \u2019 s beatlesque / monkeesque <MASK> were demonstrated by the \u201c mop - top \u201d wig placed atop koenig \u2019 s head for his first few episodes until his own hair grew out to a suitable length . ( as william shatner recalled , \u201c <MORE> second - hand long after the fact . <PARA> however , apparently there is at least something to the pravda <MASK> , as the 1996 book inside star trek : the real <MASK> ( by desilu executive herb solow and star trek associate producer robert justman ) reproduces a 1967 letter from gene roddenberry on star trek letterhead to the editor of pravda , informing the latter of chekov \u2019 s addition to the cast . unless the letter was a latter - day forgery created to lend support to a publicity stunt , it would indicate that roddenberry at least believed pravda had run such an editorial , whether they genuinely did or not . <PARA> all of this conflicting information makes it difficult to assign a \u201c <MASK> \u201d or \u201c <MASK> \u201d <MASK> to the <MASK> <MASK> at the top of this page . in a strict sense , one could say it isn \u2019 t <MASK> that the chekov character was added to the star trek cast because of a editorial in pravda ( whether or not such an editorial was ever actually published ), since gene roddenberry had already been thinking about creating a part for \u201c monkees - like \u201d actor in the show . however , one might impart some truth to the <MASK> in the sense that roddenberry \u2019 s belief that pravda had run such an editorial might have influenced his decision to make the new character \u2019 s nationality russian rather than british . on the other hand , one might maintain the <MASK> is literally <MASK> , since there is no <MASK> ( other than hearsay ) that pravda ever published an editorial critical of star trek \u2018 s lack of soviet crew members . <PARA> our estimation is that the <MASK> about pravda was not cooked up as a publicity stunt , due to the simple fact that it wasn \u2019 t publicized at the time . the account of how the chekov character was added to the star trek crew to put those complaining soviets in their place wasn \u2019 t trumpeted in the media at the time it supposedly happened \u2014 as far as we can tell , it was only mentioned in the book the making of star trek ( not exactly a best - seller ) over a year after chekov \u2019 s debut , hardly a timely or effective way of creating buzz with a cooked - up pr invention . we doubt pravda actually did run an editorial about star trek , but we also doubt that even gene roddenberry would have forged a back - dated letter to support the <MASK> that they did , so we think it likely he genuinely believed they had . how much any of this might have influenced roddenberry \u2019 s decision to make the added star trek character played by walter koenig a russian , we can \u2019 t tell at this remove .",

to 84 - year - olds is 4 , 472 . 6 deaths per 100 , 000 people a year , which would equate to over 100 deaths per 3 , 000 people annually . <PARA> nonetheless , it appears to have shocked the editors at the anti - vaccine website health impact news . in 2013 , that outlet published a <MASK> with the misleading headline \u201c 23 seniors died after receiving flu shot sold by pharmacies .\u201d snopes continues to get worried inquiries about the <MASK> every flu season . health impact news \u2019 <MASK> came from the publicly available insert that comes with a specific flu shot marketed as \u201c fluzone high - dose ,\u201d which discussed the results of scientific testing that went into approving the vaccine for use in 2009 : <PARA> fluzone high - dose , as the name implies , contains more antigens than the regular inactivated influenza virus , thereby creating more antibodies capable of defending the body against influenza . the necessity for such a drug stems from the fact that seniors require more antibodies than younger individuals to fight the flu , and because they die from it at higher rates . the results in the drug insert discussed by health impact news stem from a phase three clinical trial that occurred between 2006 and 2007 and whose results led to approval of the drug . <PARA> health impact news , based on the vaccine insert , makes three poorly formulated assertions under the guise of \u201c just asking questions .\u201d most of the answers to these questions could have been found by analyzing the publicly available raw data from the clinical trial or by reading the study that was published as a result of that trial : <PARA> as a general rule , a temporal relationship between a vaccination and a death \u2014 especially when the considered period of time includes 180 days of follow - up \u2014 is not sufficient <MASK> that the vaccination caused that death . a death can be attributable to a vaccination if it appears to have been caused by an established and known scientific mechanism \u2014 these are summarized in a 2011 national academies publication and are rooted in rigorous epidemiological data \u2014 or if an acute , adverse reaction , such as anaphylactic shock following administration , clearly causes the death . the fact that a senior with an average age of 73 died at some <MORE> days split into two periods of time . the first time period monitored by the researchers lasted 28 days . the second monitoring period lasted the following 152 days . no reasonable person would argue that a person has an equal chance of death \u2014 all other issues ignored \u2014 over a 28 - day period versus a 152 - day period . <PARA> though no data is presented about the health of the participants who died during the trial , health impact news again relies on the baseless assumption that people can die during a clinical trial in only two ways : from a condition one had prior to receiving a drug and from the drug itself being tested in the trial . in fact , a condition known as \u201c old age \u201d makes one more susceptible to a wide variety of illnesses that could conceivably develop over 180 days . <PARA> what we do know is that the population of people in this clinical trial who received the high - dose flu shot and the people who received the regular dose of the flu shot were <MASK> identical from a pre - existing health condition perspective . further , if the implication is that the flu shot caused the death of 23 people , one might reasonably infer that more deaths would be expected in the high - dose group compared to the low - dose group . this was not the case : 16 of the deaths came from the 2 , 573 individuals who received the high - dose vaccine , and seven came from the 1 , 260 who received the other vaccine . from a percentage basis , 0 . 6 % of participants in both the high - dose and low - dose groups died during the 180 - day monitoring period . <PARA> health impact news spends several paragraphs convincing the reader that giving seniors a higher dose of a flu shot is inherently wrong while ignoring voluminous scientific <MASK> supporting the notion that the elderly need a higher dose , and that such a product could save countless lives . ironically , they then present ( without context ) the results of a study that unequivocally demonstrates that a higher dose did not create any increase in long - term adverse effects but did increase the immunity of seniors . it is <MASK> that 23 people ( out of 3 , 800 ) died during the 180 - day period following vaccination , but this death rate is on par with the u . s . rate for that age group regardless of participation in a trial . <PARA> because no <MASK> is provided for the <MASK> that these 23 deaths were linked in any way to the trial in either health impact news \u2019 reporting , the raw clinical trial data , or the published report based on that trial , we rank the assertion as \u201c <MASK> .\u201d",

( additionally , some school pool facilities have reported problems with the bands \u2019 clogging up drains .) however , at times such bans have also made mention of safety issues , such as concerns that some kids were trying to wear silly bandz around their necks . <PARA> in august 2010 a silly bandz injury to a preschool child became the topic of a much - circulated e - mail that <PARA> was often accompanied by a photo of a child \u2019 s lacerated wrist . on 5 august 2010 , 4 - year - old evan steel of seneca falls , new york , presented himself to his dad while in obvious distress . as jason steel peeled away layers of silly bandz from evan \u2019 s wrists , he noticed blood on the child \u2019 s arm . <PARA> evan \u2019 s wrist , on which he had been wearing 60 or more silly bandz for about two days , was swollen and bore several deep cuts . said the physician who treated him , dr . doug alling , \u201c his dad found several bottom ones embedded in his son \u2019 s skin .\u201d the doctor prescribed an antibiotic , and the child quickly healed . <PARA> the photo sometimes circulated with the warning <MASK> above is likely the one taken by evan \u2019 s father with his cell phone and sent to sue herendeen , a nurse at alling \u2019 s office , whom steel consulted about the child \u2019 s condition . ( herendeen told him to bring the boy right in .) it is consistent with the injuries reported by the child \u2019 s family and physician in the canandaigua messenger post , and it was posted by herendeen to her facebook page along with the text of the warning . <PARA> while silly bandz are quite stretchy , they are still capable of constricting blood flow if arms are loaded with too many of these circlets and for too long . the formation of blood clots is a potential possible outcome , as is phlebitis , an inflammation of a vein . patty davis of the u . s . consumer product safety commission advises that \u201c parents should limit the number of elastic wrist bands that kids wear and they should check their children to make sure they are not too tight .\u201d jorge montalvo of the new york <MASK> consumer protection board also advises limiting the number of bands worn by a child , ensuring they are not so tight that they cause pain or constrict movement or blood flow , and making sure the youngster removes the wristwear before sleeping or bathing . <PARA> while there is always a tendency to demonize the latest trend to sweep the nation \u2019 s youngsters , it should be kept in mind that preventing a silly bandz injury is merely a matter of common sense : don \u2019 t let kids wear too many , or for too long . check for excessive tightness . and make sure kids take them off at night and before swimming or bathing .",

        "text": "<MASK> : barbara had reason to question my sanity when i woke her up this afternoon ( she \u2019 d stayed up very late to accommodate a 5 : 00 am interview request from c - span ) and offered to take her to a clothing store at the local mall , as she knows that three of my least <PARA> favorite activities are 1 ) shopping ; 2 ) clothes shopping ; and 3 ) shopping at malls . of course , my ulterior motive was soon revealed \u2014 i wasn \u2019 t interested in clothes shopping at all ; i merely wanted to stop by an abercrombie & fitch outlet to pick up a copy of their \u201c christmas field guide \u201d to see what all the fuss was about . ( abercrombie & fitch is a retailer of men \u2019 s , women \u2019 s , and children \u2019 s clothing and <PARA> accessories , aimed primarily at the teenage and young adult market . abercrombie & fitch was the subject of controversy in 2002 when they offered a line of t - shirts based on asian caricatures .) <PARA> the a & f quarterly available at abercrombie & fitch stores is a magazine - cum - catalog , featuring not only descriptions , pictures , and <PARA> prices of merchandise , but also <MASK> , interviews , and advertisements intended to appeal to a & f \u2019 s primary market segment ( young adults ) as well as plenty of <PARA> pictures of young people wearing abercrombie & fitch clothing . the winter 2003 edition of a & f quarterly , known as the \u201c christmas field guide ,\u201d is a hefty 280 pages , only about 100 pages of which are dedicated to catalog material . the first 121 pages include nothing but photographs of models , and the last 60 pages feature <MASK> , interviews , and ads . the content of those first 121 pages is what all the fuss is about . <PARA> as a prelude , we have to say that we saw nothing to indicate that the a & f quarterly is \u201c targeted to your 10 - to 13 - year - olds .\u201d it isn \u2019 t given away for free in abercrombie & fitch stores , nor is sent out to customers as a free mailing . the a & f quarterly is available for purchase at a & f outlets ( we paid $ 7 for our copy ) or via subscription . in - store buyers are asked to produce id to demonstrate they are are 18 or older , and the subscription card instructs readers to \u201c fill out this card and head to the nearest a & f store with a valid photo id \u201d in order to subscribe . although abercrombie & fitch does also sell children \u2019 s merchandise , all of the products advertised in the \u201c christmas field guide <MORE> idiot \u2019 s guide to amazing sex , in which she gives advice on how college students should approach sex <PARA> and navigate the lack of privacy in student housing , as well as pointers on masturbation , \u201c sex for three ,\u201d and discreet sex in movie theaters . <PARA> ( abercrombie & fitch even slyly spoofs the content of a & f quarterly in the publication itself . their \u201c ask a & f \u201d column includes a missive from someone who supposedly writes : \u201c i \u2019 m pretty upset you don \u2019 t show penises in your catalog . all i see is boobies , boobies , boobies and the occasional buttocks . i want some penises . thank you for your time . please consider putting in some penises . have a great day !\u201d) <PARA> what to make of all this ? whether something like the abercrombie & fitch \u201c christmas field guide \u201d is offensive depends upon one \u2019 s values . some people feel it \u2019 s never appropriate to use nudity and sexual suggestiveness in advertising , regardless of the product being sold or the age of the target audience . others don \u2019 t have an issue with this type of advertising as long as it \u2019 s restricted to venues where only adults are likely to see it ( e . g ., adult magazines whose sales are restricted by age ). some consumers believe it wrong for a company to employ sexually - oriented advertising for adult products if they also market children \u2019 s products as well . ( that last point seems to be applicable here : even though the products advertised in the \u201c christmas field guide \u201d don \u2019 t appear to be aimed at a pre - teen audience , abercrombie & fitch does have product lines targeted to children .) <PARA> p . s . although we left abercrombie & fitch with nothing but a catalog , barbara still got to do some clothes shopping elsewhere in the mall . <PARA> update : abercrombie & fitch pulled the \u201c christmas field guide \u201d from their stores in early december . protest groups <MASK> the act was a result of their campaigning for a boycott over abercrombie & fitch \u2019 s using the catalog \u201c as a pretext to sell sexual ideology to teens ,\u201d while an abercrombie & fitch spokesman maintained that the catalog displays was removed because stores needed display space for the launch of a new perfume called now . the \u201c christmas field guide \u201d is still available via mail order . <PARA> then , on 10 december 2003 , abercrombie & fitch announced it would stop issuing its racy quarterly catalogues and instead would be unveiling \u201c an innovative and exciting campaign in the spring .\u201d some industry analysts said the christmas 2003 edition of the publication may have offended too many people , prompting this change .",

( it was red , the elephant \u2019 s owner explained later , and this particular elephant just loved to sit on red sedans .) anyhow , the car , though considerably squashed , was still able to navigate , and the lady headed it toward the nearest garage . <PARA> on the way she ran into a traffic jam caused by a crash . the cops and the ambulance arrived on the scene just about the time she did and immediately assumed that she was part of the accident . \u201c no , no ,\u201d she assured them , \u201c i had no part in this crash . the reason my car is squashed is that an elephant just sat on it .\u201d <PARA> so they wrestled her into the ambulance and into an emergency ward to examine her for shock and head injuries . <PARA> variations : <PARA> chronicle columnist herb caen mentioned that this silly tale appears to surface whenever circus time draws near . in other words , when there be elephants about , this <MASK> puts in an appearance . <PARA> in 1975 an intrepid new york times reporter attempted to find the source of the tale by tracking back the chain of people through which it had filtered down to him . as is typical with tracing foaf ( friend of a friend ) chains , what started out looking like a simple task ended up being anything but . though he never seemed to be more than one step away from hearing the facts straight from the horse \u2019 s mouth , each time he managed to contact the person named as the one whose car had been crushed he was told , \u201c i wasn \u2019 t the one ; it was someone else \u2019 s cousin who had the encounter with the elephant .\u201d tired of locating people only to be sent on yet another leg of a wild goose chase , the reporter finally thought to contact the circus to ask them what they recalled of the accident . a circus official informed him nothing like that had happened there . <PARA> moreover , he was told this apocryphal <MASK> had been kicking around for at least fifteen years before the most recent outbreak . <PARA> key to our enjoyment of this legend is our picturing someone who was merely the victim of outrageous circumstances unsuccessfully trying to explain matters to the police even as he \u2019 s being hauled downtown . especially in versions featuring a nun or a priest , the humor is in the incongruity of their being booked on suspicion of driving under the influence when all they were doing was telling the truth . <PARA> it \u2019 s not by happenstance that the car crusher is never any other sort of circus animal or wild creature . we joke about drinkers \u2019 encountering pink elephants , so when they hear the car was done in by an elephant , the police jump to the conclusion that the driver must have been seeing things in the throes of an alcohol - induced <MASK> . change the elephant for , say , a rhino , and the police in this tale would be less likely to chalk matters up to pachyderms of the bottle and thus less likely to haul the poor protesting slob off to the hoosegow . <PARA> barbara \u201c elephantasy \u201d mikkelson <PARA> sightings : you \u2019 ll find this legend in the 1976 janwillem van de wetering novel , the corpse on the dike . also , the 1985 australian film bliss ( based on a 1981 peter carey novel of the same name ) has a scene in which a circus elephant sits on an old red fiat .",

( the location of the beaver \u2019 s castor sacs means that castoreum also often includes a mixture of anal gland secretions and urine as well .) due to the beaver \u2019 s typical diet of leaves and bark , castoreum doesn \u2019 t \u201c stink \u201d as other similar animal secretions do , but rather has a musky , vanilla scent described at the perfume site fragrantica as a \u201c sharp spreading tar - like note that reminds one of the odor of birch tar or russian leather \u201d that when diluted in alcohol picks up \u201c more pleasant , musky and fruity nuances .\u201d <PARA> because of its scent properties castoreum has long been employed in the perfume - making industry , and processed forms of castoreum have also been used as food additives , in the latter case primarily as enhancers of vanilla , strawberry and raspberry flavorings found in products such as iced tea , ice cream , gelatin , candy , fruit - flavored drinks , and yogurt . <PARA> however , the publicity afforded castoreum in recent years via alarmist food activists and \u201c where does vanilla flavouring come from ? and \u201c did you know ?\u201d social media posts is vastly overblown : <PARA> the use of castoreum in common food products today is exceedingly rare , in large part because collecting the substance is difficult ( and therefore expensive ): <PARA> according to fernelli \u2019 s handbook of flavor ingredients , total annual national consumption of castoreum , castoreum extract , and castoreum liquid combined is only about 292 pounds , which works out to an average of less than a millionth of a pound per person in the u . s . compare that figure with the approximately 20 million pounds of vanilla naturally harvested from real vanilla beans every year . depending upon as scarce a substance as castoreum to flavor the ice cream and candy found on store shelves would create nationwide shortages of those items and drive up their prices beyond the reach of all but the wealthiest consumers . <PARA> in 2011 , the vegetarian resource group ( vrg ) queried five companies that produce vanilla flavorings about whether they used any castoreum in their products , and all five replied that they did not : <PARA> castoreum as a food additive is classified by the food and drug administration as \u201c generally recognized as safe \u201d ( gras ), and therefore food manufacturers don \u2019 t always have to include castoreum in their ingredients lists and may instead refer to it as \u201c natural flavoring .\u201d however yucky that may seem , according to a 2007 safety assessment published the international journal of toxicology , consumption of castoreum poses no health risk to humans : <PARA> castoreum does still have a significant market even today , but almost exclusively for the use of the perfume industry , not the food industry .",

        "text": "two days into the 2020 new year , u . s . president donald trump ordered a drone strike that killed iranian gen . qassem soleimani in iraq , setting off an escalating series of events that included iran pulling out of its 2015 nuclear deal with the u . s . and other world powers , threats of retaliation traded in both directions , and the iraqi parliament voting to end the presence of thousands of u . s . troops in iraq . <PARA> critics of the president \u2019 s decision voiced fears that it brought the u . s . to the brink of yet another long , bloody war in the middle east . but some of trump \u2019 s supporters pointed out that former president barack obama also engaged in drone warfare . <PARA> as zenko noted , the office of the director of national intelligence released two reports tallying drone strikes under the obama administration . the first reported that there were 473 strikes between january 20 , 2009 , and december 31 , 2015 , in \u201c areas of active hostilities \u201d that included afghanistan , iraq , and syria . the second reported that there were another 53 strikes in the same region for 2016 , bringing the total to 526 , a figure that doesn \u2019 t include obama \u2019 s final 20 days in office in january 2017 . <PARA> the reports provide ranges for fatalities , with 2 , 372 to 2 , 581 \u201c combatants \u201d killed from 2009 to 2015 , and 64 to 116 civilians killed in that time frame . in 2016 , one civilian was killed while the report <MASK> anywhere from 431 to 441 combatants were killed . <PARA> exact figures on total number of strikes and resulting casualties depend on the source . independent organizations that have tracked air strikes made in the u . s .- led global war on terror generally produce figures that are higher than those produced by the u . s . government . the bureau of investigative journalism , for example , reported there were a total of 563 air strikes authorized by obama , \u201c largely by drones ,\u201d which hit targets in somalia , yemen , and pakistan . meanwhile , new america , a public policy think tank , estimates there were 571 drone strikes under the obama administration in somalia , yemen , and pakistan . <PARA> the drone program under obama and the strike that killed soleimani are not apt comparisons . the u . s . has been carrying out drone warfare in the region since the administration of george w . bush , obama \u2019 s predecessor . although such warfare has always been controversial , the fallout over the killing of soleimani is the result of his <MASK> in the iranian government . as reuters reported , \u201c major general qassem soleimani was the second most powerful man in iran . he answered only to the supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei .\u201d his killing , per reuters , \u201c struck at the heart \u201d of leadership in tehran . <PARA> in march 2018 , trump revoked an obama executive order requiring an annual disclosure of civilian deaths resulting from drone strikes . the bureau of investigative journalism also reported that the number of drone strikes ratcheted up during trump \u2019 s first year in office , doubling in somalia and tripling in yemen .",

        "text": "during a 27 april 2019 political rally in wisconsin , u . s . president donald trump made a <MASK> and incendiary remark , <MASK> that doctors and pregnant women confer with each other to decide whether to \u201c execute \u201d newborn babies . there is no truth to this <MASK> . <PARA> in a speech in green bay , trump <MASK> , \u201c the baby is born . the mother meets with the doctor . they take care of the baby , they wrap the baby beautifully . and then the doctor and the mother determine whether or not they will execute the baby .\u201d <PARA> the comment is similar to one trump made in february 2019 on twitter when senate democrats at that time blocked the \u201c born - alive abortion survivors protection act ,\u201d a bill that would require doctors to provide the same degree of care to a baby born alive after a failed abortion as they would to any other child of the same <MASK> age . citing the similarly - titled \u201c born alive infants protection act ,\u201d which has been on the books since 2002 , democratic lawmakers called the new bill an attempt to discourage abortion providers from performing legal procedures . <PARA> in his wisconsin speech , trump was referencing a veto by democratic gov . tony evers of a <MASK> - level law that mirrored the federal \u201c born - alive abortion survivors protection act ,\u201d which wisconsin \u2019 s gop lawmakers had advanced . ( evers blasted trump \u2019 s remarks , <MASK> , \u201c to say that doctors in the <MASK> of wisconsin are executing babies is just a blasphemy .\u201d) <PARA> \u201c it is not at all <MASK> ,\u201d said dr . daniel grossman , professor of obstetrics , gynecology and reproductive sciences at the university of california at san francisco , in regards to the president \u2019 s comments about \u201c executing \u201d babies . doing so would be illegal , as illustrated by the infamous case of kermit gosnell , who was convicted of murder in 2013 for delivering babies of unwanted pregnancies and ending their lives by severing their spinal cords at his philadelphia abortion clinic . <PARA> stories about babies surviving abortions and either being killed or callously left alone to die is a common pro - life trope , as are over - representations about the frequency and legality of late - term abortions . <PARA> grossman says a fetus likely could not survive an abortion , and if it did , the law requires that it be cared for in the same manner as any other baby of its same <MASK> age . ( although there \u2019 s no bright line , fetuses are generally considered viable outside the uterus sometime between the 24th and 26th week of <MASK> , depending on its health , grossman said .) <PARA> according to the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ), <MORE> majority of terminations after 24 weeks are done with medication . injections are used first to induce fetal demise , and then medications are given to induce delivery , grossman told us . <PARA> in rare cases a pregnancy must be ended to save the life of the pregnant woman . and those cases sometimes involve a delivery in which the fetus can \u2019 t survive outside the uterus or would suffer severe disabilities if it did , grossman added . conditions can include preeclampsia , a deadly condition that can occur as early as 20 weeks into pregnancy characterized by high blood pressure and organ damage in the woman . it can only be treated by delivering the fetus . <PARA> those cases result in painful decisions that the parents and their medical care team must make \u2014 either take what \u2019 s known as \u201c heroic measures \u201d to intervene aggressively in an effort to save the baby \u2019 s life , or to instead provide comfort care as the baby \u2019 s life ends naturally . \u201c that \u2019 s a very difficult and personal decision that family has to make with their care team ,\u201d grossman said . <PARA> it \u2019 s also important to note that \u201c heroic measures \u201d in these cases can be painful , not just futile , as they involve starting intravenous ( iv ) lines in tiny , fragile blood vessels to push drugs ; multiple blood draws \u2019 and sticking a breathing tube down the baby \u2019 s windpipe to force air into the lungs . \u201c these are really severe cases involving severe malformation [ and / or ] extreme prematurity , where really the chance [ of survival ] is close to zero if not zero , and it just doesn \u2019 t make sense to put both the baby and the family through that ,\u201d grossman added . <PARA> grossman told us that trump \u2019 s most recent remarks are worrisome because while the physical safety of abortion providers has always been an immediate concern , the <MASK> widens the target to include regular providers . \u201c what he said most recently , that wasn \u2019 t really just talking about abortion providers . he was kind of implying that regular ob - gyns might do what he described .\u201d <PARA> in a <MASK> released by the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists , dr . lisa hollier , the organization \u2019 s president , called trump \u2019 s comments inflammatory and offensive , saying , \u201c the rhetoric used to describe the delivery of abortion care was offensive , wrong , and dangerous . <MASK> of this sort undermine the public \u2019 s trust in ob - gyns and stigmatize necessary health care for women . politicians must never use inflammatory language that can contribute to or encourage hostility or violence toward doctors , other medical professionals or individuals seeking or receiving health care .\u201d",

( indeed , it contains no reference to christmas or december , its only association with either of those seasons being a mention of snow .) while several <MASK> stories about the song \u201c jingle bells \u201d are extant , the most popular has it that pierpont wrote the song for a thanksgiving program at his father \u2019 s sunday school . the song proved to be so popular the children were asked to the sing the song again at christmastime , and it has been tied to the latter holiday ever since : <PARA> this version of the <MASK> has been disputed by some historians , however , who believe \u201c jingle bells \u201d would have been too racy for a sunday school in the 1850s : <PARA> \u201c jingle bells \u201d may not have started out as a christmas song , but now , more than 150 years after its initial publication , it has become staple of the winter holiday season . historian roger lee hall noted the song was first recorded by the edison male quartette in 1898 , and later by benny goodman in 1935 and glenn miller in 1941 , but the song didn \u2019 t truly become a christmas staple until after bing crosby waxed a jazzy version of it with the andrews sister in 1943 :",

        "text": "in december 2018 , reports emerged that an online crowd - funding campaign was attempting to circumvent an ongoing budget standoff between the white house and congressional democrats . the fight was over $ 5 billion in annual funding demanded by president donald trump for his long - promised wall along the southern border of the united <MASK> . <PARA> cnbc reported that \u201c a fundraiser to build a wall along the u . s .- mexico border has raised nearly $ 5 million in three days on the online platform gofundme .\u201d politico wrote : \u201c brian kolfage , a 37 - year - old florida resident who was severely wounded in the iraq war , has started a gofundme campaign to complete trump \u2019 s signature pledge . the campaign has raised over $ 4 million in the three days since it started , with an overall goal of $ 1 billion .\u201d <PARA> the fundraiser is real . by 20 december , four days after it was started , the crowd - funding campaign called \u201c we the people will fund the wall \u201d had raised more than $ 7 million . <PARA> the man behind it , brian kolfage , is an air force veteran who lost three of his limbs while deployed in iraq and was awarded a purple heart in 2004 . kolfage is also an outspoken supporter of the current president , and he frequently shares his conservative political views on social media . <PARA> he was previously an administrator of the right wing news facebook page , which was one of hundreds removed from the social networking platform in october for what facebook described as \u201c inauthentic activity .\u201d as of 20 december , kolfage was listed as a \u201c social media and advertising strategist \u201d for the rightwing . news website , which has a track record of publishing junk news and hyper - partisan conspiracy theories , some of which we have previously debunked . <PARA> kolfage also ran a now - defunct affiliate website of right wing news called freedom daily , whose long record of producing often racially inflammatory junk news we have repeatedly documented . in february 2018 , freedom daily was one of several such sites sued for defamation in federal court for <MASK> identifying a michigan teenager as being responsible for the killing of heather heyer , an anti - racist counter - protester at the august 2017 unite the right rally in charlottesville , virginia . <PARA> the description on his crowd - funding campaign page for the border wall reads : <PARA> the campaign is real , but it \u2019 s not clear how it might function , and whether it could make even a small contribution to the actual cost of any border - wall construction . <PARA> kolfage \u2019 s <MASK> that \u201c if the 63 million people who voted for trump each pledge $ 80 , we can build the <MORE> study conducted by democratic senate staff estimated it would cost as much as $ 70 billion to construct and $ 150 million per year to maintain . <PARA> in the first four days of the campaign , kolfage raised around $ 7 million , which equates to $ 1 . 75 million per day . even at that impressive rate ( one that is unlikely to be sustained beyond the initial excitement and media attention surrounding the campaign ), it would take 571 days to reach $ 1 billion . <PARA> this means kolfage \u2019 s campaign would only raise 20 percent of what trump asked for in 2019 alone , halfway through 2020 . <PARA> based on trump \u2019 s most recent , reduced estimate for the total cost of the wall ($ 15 - 20 billion ), it would take kolfage \u2019 s campaign between 23 and 31 years to pay for it , and that would only be possible if gofundme increased its current fundraising ceiling of $ 1 billion by between 1 , 400 and 1 , 900 percent . ( we asked gofundme whether it was considering raising that cap , but we did not receive a response .) <PARA> furthermore , in order to reach trump \u2019 s projected total cost of $ 15 - 20 billion , the 63 million americans who voted for him in 2016 would have to contribute between $ 238 and $ 317 each , not the $ 80 per head presented by kolfage . <PARA> in light of these facts , we asked kolfage several questions , including whether he accepted that \u2014 even if his $ 1 billion target was met in a timely manner \u2014 it still would not be sufficient to cover the cost of a border wall , and what purpose , therefore , his campaign could serve . <PARA> we also asked kolfage who or what entity he had designated as the beneficiary of the fundraising , and to whose bank account the funds could be released . ( the campaign page invites donors to send checks to kolfage himself , and says that \u201c 100 % of your donations will go to the trump wall .\u201d) we did not receive any response to our questions . <PARA> the campaign page does stipulate that , \u201c if we don \u2019 t reach our goal or come significantly close we will refund every single penny . we are working on a time frame to achieve .\u201d however , the campaign does not have a termination date or explanation of what might count as \u201c significantly close \u201d to the $ 1 billion target . <PARA> gofundme does have a policy and mechanism whereby a donor can demand a refund in the event of \u201c misuse \u201d by the campaign manager or the intended beneficiary of the funds ; but that policy is relatively narrowly defined and might not protect donors in all circumstances .",

        "text": "<MASK> : used underwear that has supposedly been previously worn by schoolgirls is being offered for sale in vending machines in japan . though we don \u2019 t know the current price for such items , in 1993 they sold for the equivalent of us $ 50 apiece . <PARA> we \u2019 d read that this practice ended in 1993 and reported as much in the <MASK> of this <MASK> ( which was penned in 2001 ), but since that time numerous readers living in japan have written to say that not only haven \u2019 t the machines gone away , but that they \u2019 ve themselves seen them . <PARA> japan is home to a thriving bura - sera industry \u2014 <PARA> of which traffic in the soiled panties of schoolgirls represents only one part \u2014 with \u201c bura - sera \u201d or \u201c buru - sera \u201d the term for a specific male fascination relating to that country \u2019 s schoolgirls . \u201c buru \u201d is anglicized japanese ( japlish ) for \u201c bloomers \u201d and \u201c sera \u201d for \u201c sailor \u201d; the term refers to the sailor suit , the predominant style of girls \u2019 junior and high school uniforms . dozens , if not hundreds , of magazines are exclusively devoted to bura - sera photographs , pictures that feature girls clad in school garb , holding up their skirts to display their panties . usually in such photos the girls \u2019 faces are hidden , but that is not always the case . <PARA> girlish youth and innocence are considered sexy in japan , a culture with a long <MASK> of regarding women more as sex toys than as people . this obsession with untouched adolescence results in the sad sight of women in their thirties emitting girlish giggles and clutching teddy bears in an effort to maintain their appeal to the opposite sex . although it can fairly be said western society also prizes youth in a woman , there the fascination has to do more with the looks of a girl than it does with her immaturity and presumed sexual innocence . a pretty 26 - year - old who would be considered lovely in the west would in japan be viewed by many as hopelessly long in the tooth . <PARA> western society looks for firm , youthful bodies housing the attitudes of grown women \u2014 we like them young , but we don \u2019 t like them to act young . in the west , a teen \u2019 s sex appeal is dependent upon her ability to look and act much older , thus the fascination with makeup and plunging necklines , accoutrements that make her appear less of a child and more of a woman . in japan , this ideal is reversed \u2014 sexy in the land of the rising sun adds up to childlike behavior and modes of dress that express this ideal . sometimes this amounts <MORE> there is no guarantee that all the panties marketed as having been worn by schoolgirls actually have been . such details are not scrupulously vetted ; no regulatory body checks to ensure the veracity of <MASK> made about these items . however , it is clear that at least some of the used undies do come from teen girls , thus this \u201c underwear of a japanese schoolgirl \u201d <MASK> is no myth . <PARA> japan has a tradition of vending through machines what western society would view as unusual consumables . in addition to the many items one would typically expect to find offered for sale in this manner , porn magazines , disposable cameras , new pantyhose , horoscopes , and many other goods are routinely mechanically vended . <PARA> part of the appeal of such machines is attributable to a matter of convenience , but concern for privacy also fuels the mania . there is less chance of embarrassment in buying condoms from a machine than from a store where the sale must be rung up and bagged by a clerk . likewise , purchases of \u201c pink \u201d videos ( what in the west are termed \u201c blue movies \u201d) are less likely to be blush - producing experiences when these transactions can be effected without anyone else \u2019 s looking on . <PARA> there was thus a waiting market for \u201c schoolgirl panties \u201d machines , in that those looking to obtain such items would not have to brave a bura - sera shop to fulfill their desires . these mechanical points of sale appeared in 1993 in chiba city ( chiba prefecture ), in an area known for its porn magazine and adult video vending machines . almost immediately , an outcry was raised against them , but there was a problem in getting them removed : whereas sellers required licenses to distribute other types of goods , no such requirement was on the books for soiled underwear , because no one had foreseen the possibility of trade in such an item . these machines existed outside the law in the sense that no specific <MASK> existed that could be invoked to combat them . <PARA> the solution was as creative as it is odd - sounding \u2014 the machines were countered by invoking the antique dealings law , a <MASK> which stipulates that an antique dealer or a dealer in second - hand items must obtain permission from local authorities . lacking those permissions , the items could not be vended . <PARA> in september 1993 , three businessmen were charged with selling used panties without a permit under the provenance of this law . this supposedly ended the presence of such salespoints in that country , but like we said at the top of this piece , countless readers have since written to tell us that the machines can still be found . <PARA> barbara \u201c vend me your rears \u201d mikkelson",

rosenblum alleges the crime in her complaint . per u . s . federal law , kidnapping is any instance in which a person or group \u201c unlawfully seizes , confines , inveigles , decoys , kidnaps , abducts , or carries away and holds for ransom or reward or otherwise any person , except in the case of a minor by the parent thereof ,\u201d and takes the victim to a new location . the federal government is likely to argue officers only arrested people who were suspected of committing crimes and had reason to detain them . <PARA> in sum , we rate this <MASK> a \u201c mixture \u201d of truth , <MASK> and unproven information \u2014 yes , the president ordered federal officers to portland during protests in summer 2020 , and at least some of those agents used unmarked vehicles , though no verifiable <MASK> showed they \u201c kidnapped \u201d people under the legal definition of the term , nor that they did not identify themselves as law enforcement during the apprehensions .",

messidi posted an update to the crowd - funding page , announcing <MORE> of pittsburgh gave a $ 155 , 000 check to the tree of life synagogue ( the funds raised by this campaign ).\u201d <PARA> on 28 november , tree of life \u2019 s president sam schachner and rabbi hazzan jeffrey myers wrote open letters of thanks to the islamic center of pittsburgh , celebratemercy , and mpower change , describing the donations as \u201c a powerful act of love .\u201d we obtained copies of both letters , which can be read below . <PARA> the letters were addressed to wasi mohamed , executive director of the islamic center of pittsburgh , who acted as an intermediary in the transfer of the funds . schachner and myers wrote : <PARA> those letters definitively confirmed what the muslim groups behind the crowd - funding campaign had said all along \u2014 that 100 percent of the money raised would go to the tree of life synagogue . those transfers had already taken place by the time the gateway pundit , conservative review , and townhall published their <MASK> . <PARA> furthermore , a 25 november <MASK> from the progressive jewish community web site the forward , an <MASK> cited by the conservative review itself , contained a link to a document signed by tree of life \u2019 s financial controller stacey hausman on 21 november which acknowledged the transfer of funds . <PARA> that document was a three - way agreement between celebratemercy , the islamic center of pittsburgh , and tree of life , about how the first $ 155 , 000 would be transferred to tree of life and distributed among the families of those killed and injured in the synagogue shooting . contrary to the conservative review \u2019 s <MASK> , the link to the document was not dead at the time the conservative review published their <MASK> : <PARA> so by the time the conservative review , gateway pundit , and townhall had published their <MASK> on 27 november , a document was already available online that outlined in detail how the funds would be transferred to tree of life , a document signed by a representative from tree of life . the agreement also made it clear that the money was not being \u201c funneled \u201d to the islamic center of pittsburgh ( as the conservative review <MASK> ) but rather that the center was acting as a temporary intermediary in the transfer of collected monies . <PARA> in their 28 november letter of thanks , the synagogue \u2019 s president and rabbi also confirmed what celebratemercy and mpower change had consistently outlined as the intended purpose of the additional $ 84 , 534 raised through the crowd - funding campaign : tree of life committed to using it for \u201c projects that will help foster muslim / jewish collaboration , dialogue and solidarity ,\u201d on the condition that the initial $ 155 , 000 proved sufficient to meet the needs of the victims and their families .",

hand account of the incident . that tiktok account is no longer available , but snopes recorded the videos in which <USER> said she wasn \u2019 t sure whether deluca dropped her flag or it was taken from her hands . she added : <PARA> <MASK> is also lacking to support the <MASK> that deluca was attacked by blm activists , specifically . in her interview with national file , she described one of the women who assaulted her as a \u201c white older woman \u2013 she had glasses on , a glittery bedazzled black lives matter shirt .\u201d however , in <USER> video , the incident that appears to have left deluca with a bloodied mouth is obscured by bystanders . so we can \u2019 t identify the person who appears to have punched deluca , or what they were wearing . <PARA> the woman whom deluca can be seen pushing wore a pink t - shirt with what appears to be a \u201c my roots \u201d design \u2014 a graphic that consists of a woman wearing glasses , whose hair is composed of images of iconic figures from black <MASK> , including nelson mandela , thurgood marshall , jessie owens , and barack and michelle obama . the same t - shirt was worn by others at the oct . 17 women \u2019 s march . a screenshot of the woman pushed by deluca can be viewed below , alongside a clearer image of the t - shirt , worn by another protester , and a postcard available for purchase online : <PARA> the t - shirt does not appear to mention the blm movement , so even if the woman whom deluca pushed later struck her , it would constitute poor <MASK> for the <MASK> that deluca was struck by blm activists , although that remains a possibility .",

raised species are riddled with contaminants , lack essential nutrients , and contain a less desirable balance of omega - 6 fatty acids versus omega - 3 fatty acids than do other popular types of seafood . <PARA> an internet meme making the social media rounds since 2017 goes so far as to <MASK> that tilapia is a \u201c mutant \u201d species not found in nature that is literally \u201c killing our families \u201d because it is so unhealthy to eat . <MASK> to form , the fear - mongering meme does not cite a single source to support its extreme <MASK> : <PARA> to begin with the most obvious flaw in this error - riddled presentation , it is illustrated with a commonly used stock photo of a tilapia fish showing that it does , in fact , have skin . tilapia also have bones ( as anyone who has ever cleaned or filleted one knows ). <PARA> please enjoy this educational video : <PARA> health concerns have been raised about the consumption of farm - raised versus wild - caught fish , mainly due to questionable aquacultural practices that can result in fish diseases , which some producers treat with antibiotics . however , environmental defense fund scientist tim fitzgerald told the new york times in 2014 that fish farming practices have been improving , and alert consumers can find \u201c healthy and eco - friendly farmed options \u201d by choosing their merchants carefully . fitzgerald recommended aiming for a mix of both wild and farmed seafood for best results . <PARA> tilapia fish are mostly vegetarian and subsist on algae and freshwater plants in the wild , although , as the meme indicates , under aquacultural conditions they are fed corn and soybeans . given that the vast majority of corn and soybean varieties grown worldwide are now genetically manipulated to be herbicide - tolerant and insect resistant , unless otherwise labeled the likelihood that farm - raised tilapia have eaten genetically modified products is quite high . <PARA> there is no scientific <MASK> to support the assumption that feeding farm - raised tilapia genetically engineered products makes the fish unsafe for humans to consume , however . in an <MASK> published on the u . s . department of agriculture ( usda ) web site , iowa <MASK> university food scientist ruth s . macdonald notes that there is no <MASK> that altered dna from gmo feed is transferred to the animals that consume it , nor that gmo foods generally pose a health risk to human beings . the scientific consensus on gmo safety remains strong . <PARA> the <MASK> that eating tilapia \u201c is worse than eating bacon or a hamburger \u201d appears to have been gleaned from web sites reacting to a 2008 study pointing out that farm - raised tilapia offers a less desirable ratio of health - promoting omega - 3 fatty acids to potentially inflammatory omega - 6 fatty acids . a summary of the research said : <PARA> we hasten to note that there is an obvious difference between saying that the inflammatory potential of hamburger and bacon is lower than that of tilapia , and saying that eating tilapia is \u201c worse \u201d than eating those other foods . more importantly , the overall implications of the study have been challenged by other experts . sanford health nutrition researcher william s . harris wrote that despite its particular fatty acid content , eating tilapia is still a healthy choice , and replacing it with bacon , hamburgers , or donuts is \u201c absolutely not recommended \u201d: <PARA> according to walter c . willett , professor of nutrition at harvard school of public health , the authors of the tilapia study overlooked the established health benefits of omega - 6 fatty acids : <PARA> as to the <MASK> that \u201c dioxin is found in this fish ,\u201d while it \u2019 s accurate to say that the toxic ( and sometimes carcinogenic ) chemical compounds known as dioxins sometimes turn up in both wild and farmed seafood ( as they do in other foods ), we came up short when we looked for <MASK> that dioxins are found in tilapia more often than in any other seafood . exposure to industrial contaminants such as dioxins is likely to vary according to where ( i . e ., in what countries ) the fish are harvested . <PARA> at least one scientific report found that farmed fish such as tilapia are no more prone to contamination by dioxins ( or mercury , for that matter ) than wild - caught specimens . another study found that tilapia , like other smaller , relatively short - lived species , are less likely to accumulate such contaminants in their flesh than larger , longer - lived species such as salmon . <PARA> the bottom line is that none of the supposed justifications for avoiding tilapia or <MASK> that \u201c it \u2019 s killing our families \u201d hold water . to the contrary , the u . s . food and drug administration ( fda ) included tilapia in its 2017 list of \u201c best choices \u201d for seafood consumption by pregnant women and children , recommending two to three servings per week . the fda also recommends eating a variety of fish , obviating the need to worry about balancing one \u2019 s intake of fatty acids .",

<PARA> there was an off duty county deputy at the theater . she pulled out her gun and shot the man 4 times before he had a chance to kill anyone . so since this <MASK> makes the point that the best thing to stop a bad person with a gun is a good person with a gun , the media is treating it like it never happened . <PARA> only the local media covered it . the city is giving her a medal next week . <PARA> <MASK> : according to news accounts , on the evening of 16 december 2012 , a 19 - year - old man named jesus manuel garcia showed up at the china garden restaurant in san antonio with a gun in an incident believed to have something to do with his former girlfriend ( who worked at the restaurant ). after garcia opened fire at the restaurant , he pursued a number of employees who had fled across a parking lot to an adjacent theater , where he was eventually stopped by an off - duty law enforcement officer who was working as a guard at the theater : <PARA> the employees inside the restaurant fled out a side door into the parking lot . investigators said garcia began chasing the employees and continued firing at them as they ran through the parking lot and into the mayan palace theatre next door . <PARA> as garcia was running through the parking lot , he shot the windshield of a san antonio police patrol car after an officer in the car shined a spotlight on him . the <PARA> officer was not injured . <PARA> garcia then ran inside the movie theater , where he continued his search for the restaurant employees . movie - goers in the lobby , bathroom , and some theaters reported hearing multiple gunshots . the gunshots caused people inside the theater to panic . <PARA> \u201c everybody was just coming out of the side of the theater , running out the emergency exits . and everyone was screaming and running ,\u201d a woman who was at the theater said . <PARA> authorities said one person was shot by garcia . <PARA> garcia was finally stopped by an off - duty bexar county <MORE> , yelled for people inside the theater to get down on the ground . when garcia came out of the restroom , castellano ordered him to drop his weapon . when he refused , she shot him multiple times . <PARA> \u201c i \u2019 m not going to lie ; it was frightening ,\u201d she said . \u201c but , you know , the training kicks in . and thank you to the sheriff \u2019 s office for all of the training that we \u2019 re given .\u201d <PARA> bexar county sheriff amadeo ortiz presented the 13 - year veteran with the medal of valor for taking down a gunman inside a south - side movie theater . <PARA> according to police and deputies at the scene , 19 - year - old jesus garcia ran into the santikos mayan palace after firing several shots inside a nearby restaurant [ and ] in the parking lot . <PARA> castellano , who was off duty , yelled for people inside the theater to get down on the ground . when garcia came out of the restroom , castellano ordered him to drop his weapon . when he refused , she shot him multiple times . <PARA> \u201c i \u2019 m not going to lie ; it was frightening ,\u201d she said . \u201c but , you know , the training kicks in . and thank you to the sheriff \u2019 s office for all of the training that we \u2019 re given .\u201d <PARA> some of the details in the example at the head of this <MASK> appear to be inaccurate : news reports indicate garcia didn \u2019 t shoot his ex - girlfriend ( she wasn \u2019 t even present at the restaurant at the time ), and it isn \u2019 t yet clear whether he was deliberately intending to shoot innocent victims at the theater ( as the gunman did in the july 2012 aurora , colorado , theater shootings ) or whether he was firing aimlessly in a fit of rage . <PARA> in general , the san antonio theater shooting received little coverage outside of local news media , primarily because it didn \u2019 t include any of the factors that typically propel such stories from local to national news : it was not an especially horrific crime ( or part of a larger crime ), it did not involve any deaths or the wounding of large numbers of people , and it featured no prominent persons : it was a shooting incident in which a single person was injured . the possibility that an armed guard may have prevented additional casualties by shooting the gunman might have made the incident more newsworthy than usual , but that aspect of the <MASK> was speculative , and as others have observed , the news media tend to highlight negative events rather than positive ones : \u201c reporters don \u2019 t report buildings that don \u2019 t burn .\u201d",

( the <MASK> exists in both forms : something about these dogs kills asthma , or <PARA> chihuahuas serve as canine illness sponges .) <PARA> consequently , many families of asthmatic children have rushed to purchase these dogs and install them as family pets . some believers in this cure insist the child must sleep with the chihuahua if the remedy is to be effected ; others also specify that the dog must lie on the child \u2019 s chest . <PARA> when those who pass along the news of this cure advance a source for their information , they will often says that the chihuahua remedy began with the aztecs . some will add that the aztecs revered the chihuahua as the \u201c ruler of the nose \u201d and thought it had the power to cure various ailments in addition to asthma . impressive as that sounds , there \u2019 s only scant reason to believe aztecs had anything to do with the development of the belief that this particular dog would cure this particular disease . <PARA> the aztecs certainly did like this little dog : while it is <MASK> that the chihuahua started out as a foodstuff for them , the small canine eventually came to be regarded as a spiritual guide that would help a dead aztec make his way in the afterlife , with part of that process involving the animal \u2019 s absorbing the sins of the person who \u2019 d died . this information bears enough of a resemblance to the \u201c chihuahuas cure asthma \u201d <MASK> ( i . e ., it involves the notion that chihuahuas were used to take on something noxious their human masters wanted to be rid of ) that the aztec connection cannot be completely dismissed <PARA> more plausible is the explanation that the <MASK> became attached to this particular pooch because a great many chihuahuas wheeze and make breathing noises the sound like someone struggling with asthma . it can therefore sound ( especially to those desperate for a cure ) that the dog is drawing the asthma from the sufferer and taking it up himself . ( for worried pet owners out there , we note that this not the case : asthma does not get passed from human to dog .) <PARA> unfortunately for asthma sufferers , the chihuahua remedy doesn \u2019 t work . while it is <MASK> that these creatures are somewhat less likely to provoke allergies than most other breeds of dogs , owning one will not in itself cure asthma . ( even in terms of providing canine companionship for allergy sufferers , these short - haired dogs aren \u2019 t a magic bullet : they can still stir up all the usual symptoms of asthma because it \u2019 s not fur that is the allergen ; it \u2019 s substances contained in dander and bodily secretions . however , smaller dogs and dogs with single - layered coats generally produce less dander , and chihuahuas possess both these qualities .) <PARA> the belief about chihuahuas as an asthma cure has been around for a very long time ; we found it written up in a 1956 folklore journal and a 1965 medical journal . one of the reasons for the <MASK> \u2019 s longevity has to do with the nature of asthma in children : about half of young sufferers lose their symptoms sometime during childhood or adolescence . that inexplicable loss , coupled with <PARA> the presence in the home of the four - legged asthma cure ( the chihuahua ), works to entrench belief in the fiction that the dog cures the disease . <PARA> in this sense , the belief is akin to the various \u201c wart cures \u201c that folklore advocates for the treatment of children afflicted with such bumpy growths : the body \u2019 s eventual triumph over the virus is mistakenly attributed to some external cure , such as rubbing these benign skin tumors with bean pods or snails or wishing them onto the occupants of passing hearses . <PARA> beliefs that canines can be pressed into accepting human illness and thereby freeing human sufferers from their physical maladies are quite old . for instance , an 1898 folklore journal examined a midwestern folk remedy that <MASK> : \u201c the negro sometimes sleeps with a young dog in order to transmit rheumatism to the dog .\u201d",

is the sign \u2019 s legend a message reflecting the former viewpoint ( i . e ., \u201c even president bush \u2019 s critics have to acknowledge that things have been worse under president obama \u201d), or the latter ( i . e ., \u201c even though things may be bad now , think about how much worse they were under the previous administration \u201d)?

it merely affords one \u2019 s body the ability to destroy the toxin they produce . <PARA> that fact does mean a child without a tetanus vaccination poses no additional risk to others . it is worth mentioning , however , that 2 in 10 people who develop tetanus die from the disease , and that the tetanus vaccine ( which is generally included in a three - vaccine combination ) is uncontroversially safe for use in nearly all populations . <PARA> obukhanych attempts to make a similar argument against hepatitis b vaccination , arguing that since it is a blood - borne disease , it is unlikely to be spread amongst children : <PARA> obukhanych confidently asserts that hepatitis b does not \u201c spread in a community setting ,\u201d but while non - sexual and non - needle based transmissions are rare , they are not impossible , as the <MORE> it provides <MASK> the ipv vaccine does not protect against the wild poliovirus . she does this to make the clever - sounding argument that a vaccinated child might pose a risk to unvaccinated children , but she does so by ignoring everything but a single sentence found in a single diagram in a lengthy new england journal of medicine study that sought to address the vaccine \u2019 s effectiveness against wild polioviruses . <PARA> in her post , she references a footnote to a table showing the viral load of the feces of a control group of infants and a group treated with ipv after they were inoculated with opv . her interpretation of the figure is that \u201c high counts of live virus were recovered from the stool of children in all groups , [ making ] it clear that ipv cannot be relied upon for the control of polioviruses .\u201d <PARA> in fact , the study \u2019 s authors viewed those results as <MASK> of ipvs success against wild poliovirus strains , which ( not to put too fine a point on it ) is the opposite of the argument she <MASK> the paper is making ( emphasis ours ): <PARA> the world health organization \u2019 s view tracks that study \u2019 s view of ipv as well , <MASK> that it \u201c has been used successfully to eradicate polio in a few countries , notably in scandinavia and the netherlands , [ and that in the ] numerous countries that have been introduced to ipv over the last decade no <MASK> of continued circulation of poliovirus strains has been observed , indicating that ipv may successfully inhibit community transmission of poliovirus .\u201d <PARA> obukhanych bills herself as a recovering \u201c mainstream \u201d academic who has seen the error of her field \u2019 s ways . she <MASK> a phd in epidemiology from the rockefeller university in new york and <MASK> on her patreon page that she \u201c held postdoctoral research training appointments in prominent immunology laboratories affiliated with harvard medical school and stanford university school of medicine .\u201d her publication record supports the notion that she held positions at , or worked with , these institutions , though she has few publications to her name . <PARA> despite not being a physician , she is a \u201c founding director \u201d of physicians for informed consent ( an organization described in multiple science - based medical blogs as a \u201c radical anti - vaccine \u201d group ), and she has produced a self - published e - book titled vaccine illusion : how vaccination compromises our natural immunity and what we can do to regain our health . she also sells access to her teleconferenced lectures for $ 20 . 00 a month . <PARA> describing her \u201c open letter \u201d published on an anti - vaccine blog as a \u201c harvard study \u201d is , in our view , quite a bit of a stretch .",

generically speaking , any form of forced labor can be called slavery . but what do we gain by doing so , besides blurring historical distinctions ? consider impressment , the 18th - century british naval practice of kidnapping young men and forcing them to serve on sailing vessels . that \u2019 s slavery , in a sense . so is being sentenced to hard labor in prison . but while these share features in common with the institution of chattel slavery in america , they are on a whole separate plane . <PARA> it isn \u2019 t \u201c bias \u201d that keeps legitimate historians from substituting the term \u201c slavery \u201d for \u201c impressment ,\u201d \u201c hard labor ,\u201d or even \u201c forced indentured servitude .\u201d it \u2019 s a simple respect for the facts .",

only the red dorsal stripe distinguishes them . <PARA> redbacks are found everywhere throughout the australian continent , especially alongside human habitation . <PARA> only females build webs . their smaller , less brilliantly colored male counterparts often lurk to the side . <PARA> humans must be careful . the spider won \u2019 t seek out people to sting , but should a hand stray into her web by accident , a trip to the emergency room may be in order as the venom acts directly on the nerves . <PARA> only the female bite is dangerous , and their bites have caused some human deaths . <PARA> the redback possesses a potent neurotoxic venom . it does not hunt its prey , but instead waits for a tasty morsel to wander by and become entangled in its web . <PARA> once the prey - usually a walking insect - becomes enmeshed in the redback \u2019 s web , it \u2019 s wrapped in silk . when it \u2019 s time to eat , the spider bites down on its intended victim , injecting its neurotoxic venom . the venom paralyzes the insect , and digestive enzymes begin to dissolve the prey \u2019 s insides . <PARA> antivenom for redback spider bites has been available since 1956 , and no known deaths directly attributable to redback bites have been documented in more than fifty years since then , which makes this latest case in ireland quite a subject of interest . however , note that the victim \u2019 s wife , jeanne , <MASK> her husband didn \u2019 t die soon after being bitten by a spider ; he had actually been bitten a year earlier , and then he experienced a long period of declining health with various symptoms before finally passing away in july 2014 : <PARA> \u201c but the bite he got had bled very badly . we went through a roll and a half of toilet roll to try and stop it . <PARA> \u201c ever since his health went down . <PARA> \u201c his stomach started swelling , they said it was his liver and his pancreas . <PARA> \u201c his testicles also swelled up very bad .\u201d <PARA> jeanne , 46 , went on to describe how john \u2019 s eyesight deteriorated and he started vomiting blood . <PARA> he eventually died in hospital last month and an inquest into his death has begun \u2014 but jeanne is already convinced it was the spider . <PARA> \u201c it had to be down to that sting . <PARA> \u201c he was in perfect health before the bite happened .\u201d <PARA> so there \u2019 s as yet no certainty that john francis kennedy was actually bitten by a redback spider , which had not previously been sighted in ireland , other than someone \u2019 s year - old recollection of what the spider in question looked like . and even if that species of spider did deliver a bite to the victim , it \u2019 s unproven at this point that his death was directly attributable to that bite . he may have died from something else completely coincidental to that bite , he may have been suffering from an undiagnosed medical condition that had already compromised his health and was exacerbated or compounded by the bite \u2019 s effects , or he may have suffered an allergic reaction to the bite ( rather than being killed by the venom itself ) \u2014 a host of alternative explanations are possible . <PARA> until additional ( and less tabloid - sensational ) details are provided about this case , it \u2019 s far too early to <MASK> this as a verified example of a redback spider bite death in ireland . and for those locals who fear that such critters are taking up residence in the area : <PARA> currently there are no national records of redback spider sightings .",

ago days no one knew about viruses , folk beliefs sprang up to explain the sudden appearance of warts on the healthy . a child who had developed one of these growths on his hands was said to have handled a toad , with the toad passing one of its bumps to the unsuspecting youngster . alternatively , he was said to have washed his hands in water that had been used to boil eggs . <PARA> yet if folks were mildly curious about where warts came from , they were obsessed with getting rid of them , spawning numerous rituals and curious customs that were supposed to effect wart cures . one school of thought held that rubbing a wart with a bean pod <PARA> and then in great secrecy burying the pod would rid one of the beasties \u2014 as the pod rotted away in the ground , so was the wart to subside . another belief dictated the same <MORE> rubbed with chickpeas , pebbles , or grains of wheat which were then tied up in small bundles and transported to crossroads . the contaminated items were then flung in any direction , with the person doing the pitching taking care not to see where they landed , the idea being that whoever picked up these items would have the warts transferred to him . <PARA> washing away warts involved bathing them with liquids held to have special properties , such as water collected from a depression in a stump , holy water , or the blood of animals like eels , cats , pigs , and moles . they could also be spit upon every morning . <PARA> yet that wasn \u2019 t the end of it . warts could be encircled with a horse hair or a silk thread . or they could be blown upon nine times in the light of a full moon . or the one with the warts could make faces in a mirror at the stroke of midnight for three nights in a row . <PARA> each of these superstitions had its adherents . because warts disappeared as mysteriously as they arrived , their departure often coincided with \u201c cures \u201d that had been attempted . before viruses were understood to cause such growths , it made sense to ascribe a wart \u2019 s defeat to whatever insanity had recently been performed , even if it did involve buried meat or decapitated eels . <PARA> we of more modern times have set our eels behind us and rely upon time to take care of most warts . for those persistent ones the fluttering pages of the calendar fail to off , we look to a variety of surgical and medicinal methods to rid ourselves of them . scraping , freezing , electrocauterization , and co2 laser are effective against the growths , with laser removal both the most precise method and possibly the one most associated with a lower recurrence rate than other methods . those looking for a low - tech and effective method might try occluding the wart with duct tape . as crazy as this method sounds , it has been shown to work in a surprising number of cases . mind you , a 2007 study into the same thing cast doubt on those findings \u2014 it found duct tape to have helped with the wart situation in only 21 % of the cases it studied , a result that put it on par with covering such lesions with conventional \u201c moleskin ,\u201d a cottony bandage that has been around for dog \u2019 s years . however , transparent duct tape was used in that second test of its effectiveness , rather than the gray - backed rubbery sort used in the 2002 study , a difference which might account for the opposing results . <PARA> barbara \u201c still beats rubbing them with a frog , though \u201d mikkelson",

        "text": "in mid - may 2020 , as people worldwide remained quarantined to limit the spread of the covid - 19 coronavirus disease , social media posts <MASK> not only were humans on earth sheltering - in - place during the pandemic , but our life source \u2014 the sun \u2014 had gone on \u201c lockdown ,\u201d too . <PARA> recirculating sensational headlines on the concept \u2014 including the new york post \u2019 s may 14 <MASK> \u201c the sun has entered a \u2018 lockdown \u2019 period , which could cause freezing weather , famine \u201c \u2014 numerous people reached out to snopes to investigate the validity of the <MASK> : that the power of our solar system \u2019 s star had decreased to the point that life on earth would be threatened by famine , earthquakes , and freezing temperatures . <PARA> first , we considered the definitions of key terms in helioseismology ( the study of the sun ) to make sense of the <MASK> . <PARA> per astronomers \u2019 research over centuries , the sun generates powerful magnetic forces that are constantly changing , affecting the intensity of ultraviolet radiation and x - rays from the ball of gas that illuminates earth . in areas of the star where the magnetic fields are particularly strong \u2014 thus restricting some heat from the sun \u2019 s core from reaching its surface \u2014 dark spots appear , or what astronomers call sunspots . in other words , sunspots are places on the sun that are cooler than other areas . sarah scoles , a writer for the peer - reviewed science magazine , of the american association for the advancement of science , wrote in 2019 : <PARA> in contrast , flashes of light on the star \u2019 s surface occur when magnetic fields tangle or cross each other , causing a sudden explosion of energy \u2014 a phenomenon astronomers call solar flares . <PARA> all of these factors \u2014 the number of sunspots , their locations , and the intensity of solar flares , etc . \u2014 are known as solar activity , which , like scoles pointed out , fluctuates on a relatively predictable cycle every 11 years or so . astronomers measure this 11 - year timeframe , the sun cycle , in two major phases : when sunspots gradually increase over roughly five or six years , peaking for a solar maximum , and when sunspots diminish over the next approximately five or six years until there are few or zero sunspots , called a solar minimum . nasa writes : <PARA> in late 2008 , the sun began its 24th solar cycle since scientists began taking accurate measurements of solar activity . the cycle \u2019 s solar maximum , or when the sun was at its most active <MASK> with its highest level of sunspots , occurred in april 2014 , according to the national oceanic and atmospheric administration ( noaa ). and from that <MORE> of scientists sponsored by noaa and nasa that makes such projections , as of april 2019 , the upcoming roughly 11 - year sun cycle ( the 25th ) was expected to \u201c likely be weak \u201d compared to others in modern <MASK> , yet similar to the previous cycle ( the 24th ) in terms of its number of sunspots and how they pendulate over time . nasa released the following graphic to help people visualize the prediction : <PARA> that means , as of this writing , astronomers were not predicting any catastrophic damages as a result of the 2019 - 2020 solar minimum . phillips said : <PARA> since the start of astronomers \u2019 research into the sun \u2019 s patterns , it has always produced sunspots after a solar minimum , even after the 17th century \u2019 s maunder minimum , or \u201c prolonged sunspot minimum ,\u201d from 1645 to 1715 , when sunspots were exceedingly rare for about 70 years . \u201c however , there is no <MASK> that the sun is currently \u2018 stuck \u2019,\u201d phillips said of the 2020 <MASK> . \u201c on the contrary , we are already starting to see the first sunspots of the next solar cycle . by the end of this year , we will probably be on the up - swing again .\u201d <PARA> lastly , to complete our examination , we looked at where the concerns about the sun had <MASK> ; the new york post \u2019 s <MASK> was a recycled report by the british tabloid newspaper , the sun , which appeared to have been the first publication to dub what is a normal occurrence in the sun \u2019 s 11 - year cycle a \u201c lockdown \u201d without any specific attribution . the tabloid <MASK> declaratively in the report \u2019 s first paragraph : <PARA> despite the plurality of that tagline (\u201c scientists say \u201d), the sun \u2019 s <MASK> appeared to have been based on just one source : phillips . the tabloid <MASK> <MASK> him directly , giving readers the assumption that he talked directly to writers of the report and shared comments to support the sensationalist headline and first paragraph . <PARA> but in his email to snopes , phillips set the record straight : he did not provide an interview to the sun and , instead , he said its writers used <MASK> on his website , spaceweather . com , under the misleading pretense that the solar minimum would cause catastrophic effects . of the tabloid <MASK> , the astronomer said : <PARA> in sum , given the sensational , inaccurate news reporting that spurred the <MASK> , the fact that solar minimums impact space weather but do not typically cause catastrophic impacts for humans on earth \u2014 as well as the prediction by scientists that the 2019 - 2020 solar minimum would be similar to the last one \u2014 we rate this <MASK> \u201c mostly <MASK> .\u201d",

        "text": "in mid - november 2020 , an email from u . s . president donald trump \u2018 s reelection campaign alleged millions of mail - in ballots were erroneously sent to people who did not request them . ( read more fact checks like this one here .) <PARA> \u201c millions of mail - in ballots were sent to people who never asked for them ,\u201d <MASK> a nov . 16 email obtained by snopes . <PARA> the <MASK> implied people \u201c who never asked \u201d for mail - in ballots wrongfully received them , and , because of that , the election was tainted with fraud and americans should reject the results of the popular vote . <PARA> firstly , let this fact be clear : americans have been voting by mail since the civil war in the 1860s . in the modern era , the majority of <MASK> for years have allowed anyone to request an absentee ballot and submit it via mail \u2014 while others only allowed people to vote absentee if they provided a qualifying reason for why they can \u2019 t make it to a designated polling <MASK> on election day , such as illness , physical disabilities , travel , or work . <PARA> meanwhile , five <MASK> allowed all eligible voters in all elections to submit ballots entirely by mail \u2014 colorado , hawaii , oregon , washington , and utah \u2014 while other <MASK> permitted local jurisdictions to run elections by mail under certain circumstances . <PARA> the covid - 19 pandemic , however , put new pressure on the country to expand existing vote - by - mail systems to avoid spreading the virus at polls . <PARA> several <MASK> passed new laws to allow all eligible residents to vote by mail , per the national league of <MASK> legislature \u2019 s compilation of <MASK> laws governing mail - in voting in 2020 , or added \u201c covid - 19 \u201d to their list of reasonable excuses to request an absentee ballot . <PARA> but at the core of trump \u2019 s allegation about \u201c millions of mail - in ballots \u201d being sent to people who didn \u2019 t want them were <MASK> \u2019 varying rules regarding ballot applications . <PARA> most <MASK> \u2014 but not all of them \u2014 require voters to submit an application that expresses their desire to vote by mail in order to receive the official ballot paperwork to cast a vote . additionally , some <MASK> permit voters to apply for \u201c permanent absentee ballot <MASK> \u201d so they automatically receive ballots via mail each election and do not need to submit applications for each one . the nlsl <MASK> : <PARA> that said , the handful of <MASK> that have for years conducted elections entirely by mail \u2014 colorado , hawaii , oregon , washington , and utah \u2014 send ballots to every person listed in their respective databases of eligible voters , no application necessary . <PARA> with covid - 19 , california , nevada , new jersey , and vermont also conducted the 2020 presidential election that way \u2014 every eligible resident received a ballot in the mail to vote for trump or biden , per nlsl . additionally , montana allowed counties to decide whether they would conduct the election that way , no requests for mail - in ballots necessary . <PARA> so , considering the number of registered voters in those 10 <MASK> ( there are more than 4 . 2 million in colorado alone ) there \u2019 s some truth to the <MASK> \u201c millions of mail - in ballots were sent to people who never asked for them \u201d in the trump - biden race , if you consider the application process the step in which people \u201c ask for \u201d ballots . <PARA> however , that argument is flawed by the fact that recipients of those ballots at one point registered to vote . and , in at least a handful of the 10 <MASK> , by registering to vote , they were joining a vote - by - mail system that sends ballots without applications first . <PARA> in short , it is <MASK> to imply that millions of ballots were improperly or erroneously mailed in the 2020 election , or suggest that the system was a nefarious scheme to undermine trump . <PARA> we should note here : the emails from trump \u2019 s campaign attempting to sound the alarm on a fictional election conspiracy asked supporters to chip in to a so - called \u201c official election defense fund \u201d or \u201c election defense task force ,\u201d both of which the campaign framed as costly initiatives involving ballot recounts or various lawsuits to challenge biden \u2019 s win . <PARA> but according to brendan fischer , director of the federal reform program at campaign legal center , the average donor \u2019 s money was not covering those expenses . \u201c small donors who give to trump thinking they are financing an \u2018 official election defense fund \u2019 are in fact helping pay down the trump campaign \u2019 s debt or funding his post - presidential political operation ,\u201d fischer tweeted . <PARA> in sum , while it was <MASK> millions of mail - in ballots were sent to people who did not submit applications for them in the 2020 presidential election , it was a mischaracterization of <MASK> \u2019 election laws to frame that fact as <MASK> of impropriety or fraud . rather , the ballots were sent to registered voters in accordance with <MASK> laws . for those reasons , we rate this <MASK> \u201c mostly <MASK> .\u201d",

( a contemporary account confirms that crewmen shouted \u201c huzzah ! her sides are made of iron !\u201d after one enemy shot bounced off a plank and fell into the water , but many more broke through the hull and inflicted damage , according to the same source .) <PARA> another cherished anecdote chronicles a six - month voyage during which , supposedly , the officers and crew of the uss constitution single - handedly consumed more than 252 , 000 gallons of liquor ( roughly three gallons a day per sailor ), and not a single drop of water . some of the details of the <MASK> vary from teller to teller , but the punchline is always the same . <PARA> here , for example , is a version imparted in a speech by then - u . s . secretary of the navy john h . dalton in 1997 : <PARA> you are permitted to scoff . despite their age - old reputation for heroic drinking , no seamen ( or any other humans ) could have guzzled that much booze and lived . not counting the rum confiscated from british ships ( an unknown quantity ), the volume of liquor allegedly consumed in six months by the constitution \u2019 s crew of 475 totaled 252 , 700 gallons , or 2 . 94 gallons per individual per day . assuming one remained conscious long enough to consume that much in a 24 - hour period ( which is doubtful ), one would not likely survive the experience , much less repeat it day after day , week after week , for six months . the human body can only tolerate so much alcohol . <PARA> to be sure , the constitution would have sailed with a sizable store of rum on board . like their british counterparts , american seamen received a daily ration of \u201c grog \u201d ( rum , or sometimes whiskey , mixed with water ), which had been settled upon in the mid - 1700s as the most practical alternative to plain water ( which tended to spoil on long voyages , mainly due to impurities in the wooden casks in which it was stored ), beer and wine ( also prone to spoilage ), or straight rum ( prone to causing behavioral issues ). however , the grog wasn \u2019 t dispensed willy - nilly , but rather in carefully measured increments prescribed by law , as the uss constitution museum explains : <PARA> so , although the ship would have been stocked with rum , the amount would have been only a fraction of the 79 , 400 gallons <MASK> . an actual list of supplies loaded aboard the constitution prior to a 1799 voyage , for example , included 37 , 500 gallons of water ( similar to the amount <MASK> in the <MASK> ), but only 3 , 000 gallons of rum . if that was insufficient to last the voyage , it wasn \u2019 t unheard of ( though it was unpopular ) to cut grog rations as necessary . <PARA> none of which is meant to suggest that the quantity of rum is the only credibility issue to be found in this <MASK> , which , in fact , is rife with historical inaccuracies . <PARA> for one , given the multiplicity of variants in circulation , the <MASK> has been set in at least three different time periods . the version relayed by dalton <MASK> it took place during the war of 1812 ; another says the voyage commenced in 1798 ; yet another , relayed by national park service curator harold peterson and <MASK> in the book oceanographic ships , fore and aft , stipulates the date of departure as 23 august 1779 : <PARA> here \u2019 s why this version doesn \u2019 t hold water : the uss constitution couldn \u2019 t have sailed in 1779 ( during the revolutionary war ), given that they weren \u2019 t finished building it until 1797 . <PARA> it could have sailed ( and , in fact , did sail ) in 1798 , but its mission would not have been \u201c to destroy and harass english shipping ,\u201d given that the u . s . and britain were not at war . what we do know about the constitution \u2019 s 1798 voyage is summarized thus by the uss constitution museum : <PARA> the constitution saw plenty of action during the war of 1812 ( 1812 - 1815 ), of course , but the timeline of its actual exploits during that period doesn \u2019 t match up with any of the events in the <MASK> . <PARA> we therefore share the conclusion of the uss constitution museum ( and others ), to wit that the fabled rum - soaked voyage of the constitution never took place . the <MASK> was fabricated , unquestionably , though we can \u2019 t say with any certainty by whom , or precisely when . it does appear to be of fairly recent <MASK> , however . the museum notes that the earliest variant discovered by its researchers is peterson \u2019 s version , ( though they also note that peterson was a careful scholar and unlikely to have invented the <MASK> himself ). the earliest variant we \u2019 ve found besides peterson \u2019 s dates from 1959 , having appeared in volume 74 , page 112 of the reader \u2019 s digest that year .",

we can put a stop to the democrats !\u201d <PARA> the underlying message of some posts echoed trump \u2019 s attacks on georgia republican <MASK> officials who oversaw the process for certifying votes in the presidential race . in tweets and emails to supporters soliciting donations , the trump campaign called on republican gov . brian kemp and secretary of <MASK> brad raffensperger to break <MASK> laws governing the democratic process and defy the outcome of the popular vote that awarded georgia \u2019 s 16 electoral votes to biden . he won by fewer than 13 , 000 votes out of about 5 million cast . <PARA> some parler posts obtained by snopes , such as the ones displayed below , lumped senate candidates loeffler and perdue into that group of republicans who were not acceding to the trump campaign \u2019 s requests to delegitimize biden \u2019 s win by spreading baseless allegations that dominion voting systems software had altered votes . <PARA> \u201c the president has basically taken hostage this race ,\u201d said brendan buck , once a top adviser to former house speaker paul ryan , per the associated press . <PARA> in short , some posts wanted georgia voters to write in trump \u2019 s name to supposedly help him win a senate seat . meanwhile , others promoted the # writeintrumpforga campaign not to necessarily elect trump but to \u201c punish \u201d loeffler and perdue , since participating voters would , in theory , otherwise have voted for the senate republican candidates . <PARA> the assumption behind the former approach \u2014 that trump had a realistic chance to serve in the senate \u2014 was <MASK> , but the latter reasoning had some validity to it , which we explain below . <PARA> first , though , let <MORE> below . at least one twitter user <MASK> to have seen one of the signs in real life . <PARA> \u201c if trump supporters deliver perdue and loeffler a victory , they should be acutely aware that they will be delivering trump and maga a serious political defeat ,\u201d read a <MASK> by the pac . <PARA> a website , writeintrumpforgeorgiasenate . com , was also part of that tongue - in - cheek campaign effort , per an attorney for an opposing political action group . the website read : <PARA> \u201c with enough write - ins in the georgia senate race , we can tilt the balance in georgia in trump \u2019 s favor ! if we can do this , we have a real chance at getting these rino senators to act on the illegitimate and corrupt election presided over by a democrat party that is invested in the communist takeover of our great nation . \u201d <PARA> the site says it was funded by the political group \u201c committee for american sovereignty ,\u201d which according to news reports was created in 2016 to help republican operatives \u2014 including trump \u2019 s longtime political confidant roger stone \u2014 undermine hillary clinton \u2019 s presidential campaign by spewing an unfounded conspiracy theory that bill clinton had an illegitimate biracial son . <PARA> the daily beast , however , reported that paul jensen , an attorney for the committee , refuted its connection to the website , and alleged its \u201c goal is to elect the democrat candidate , suggesting that a democrat - leaning entity , not the committee for american sovereignty , is behind it .\u201d <PARA> on nov . 23 , donald trump jr . refuted the messages urging trump supporters to abstain from voting for loeffler and perdue . <PARA> more than a week later , as trump prepared for a dec . 5 visit to georgia to campaign alongside perdue and loeffler , the president echoed that sentiment , saying in a tweet \u201c we must work hard \u201d to ensure victories for the republican senate candidates . <PARA> in sum , the outcome of the runoffs remained unknown ; therefore , it was unclear how any ballots , much less those with invalid markings for trump , would impact results . <PARA> but if , instead of voting for loeffler or perdue , a significant number of republican voters unofficially wrote trump \u2019 s name on their ballots \u2014 and , as a result , election officials had to throw out those ballots \u2014 democrats \u2019 vote margins would benefit . depending on the level of participation in that protest , it could undermine senate republicans \u2019 chance at securing the chamber \u2019 s majority . <PARA> nonetheless , <MASK> and federal laws governing elections would not allow voters the opportunity to elect trump to the senate in the runoffs . for those reasons , we rate this <MASK> \u201c mostly <MASK> .\u201d",

<PARA> [ rest of <MASK> here .] <PARA> <MASK> : the gist of this piece , a reproduction of a washington examiner editorial , is that senator harry reid of nevada furtively slipped language into a health care reform bill which would absolutely prevent congress from ever modifying or repealing the section of the bill to which it applied . although the language cited does appear in the bill , it has been <MASK> out of context and its applicability has been exaggerated . <PARA> it is <MASK> that beginning on page 1 , 001 of the referenced measure , section 3403 reads in part : \u2018... it shall not be in order in the senate or the house of representatives to consider any bill , resolution , amendment or conference report that would repeal or otherwise change this subsection .'\u201d however , that sentence fragment is a misleading , selective excerpt which doesn \u2019 t provide the full context . the passage reads , in full : <PARA> ( a ) in general \u2014 it shall not be in order in the senate or the house of representatives to consider any bill , resolution , or amendment , pursuant to this subsection or conference report thereon , that fails to satisfy the requirements of subparagraphs ( a )( i ) and ( c ) of subsection ( c )( 2 ). <PARA> ( b ) limitation on changes to the board recommendations in other legislation \u2014 it shall not be in order in the senate or the house of representatives to consider any bill , resolution , amendment , or conference report ( other than pursuant to this section ) that would repeal or otherwise change the recommendations of the board if that change would fail to satisfy the requirements of subparagraphs ( a )( i ) and ( c ) of subsection ( c )( 2 ). <PARA> ( c ) limitation on changes to this subsection . \u2014 it shall not be in order in the senate or the house of representatives to consider any <MORE> changes to this subsection . \u2014 it shall not be in order in the senate or the house of representatives to consider any bill , resolution , amendment , or conference report that would repeal or otherwise change this subsection . <PARA> what that means , in effect , is that congress may not make modifications to the referenced section if such modifications do not meet criteria specified elsewhere [\u201c subparagraphs ( a )( i ) and ( c ) of subsection ( c )( 2 )\u201d] in the measure . those criteria are : <PARA> ( a ) requirements . \u2014 each proposal submitted under this section in a proposal year shall meet each of the following requirements : <PARA> ( c ) no increase in total medicare program spending . \u2014 each proposal submitted under this section shall be designed in such a manner that implementation of the recommendations contained in the proposal would not be expected to result , over the 10 - year period starting with the implementation year , in any increase in the total amount of net medicare program spending relative to the total amount of net medicare program spending that would have occurred absent such implementation . <PARA> ( c ) no increase in total medicare program spending . \u2014 each proposal submitted under this section shall be designed in such a manner that implementation of the recommendations contained in the proposal would not be expected to result , over the 10 - year period starting with the implementation year , in any increase in the total amount of net medicare program spending relative to the total amount of net medicare program spending that would have occurred absent such implementation . <PARA> in other words , these prolix passages do not absolutely bar any changes to the measure ; they \u2019 re simply protections that prohibit congress from enacting modifications to the referenced section that would create an increase in net medicare program spending or cause it to go over budget . moreover , page 1002 specifically <MASK> that such protections may be waived by a three - fifths vote of the senate : <PARA> ( d ) waiver . \u2014 this paragraph may be waived or suspended in the senate only by the affirmative vote of three - fifths of the members , duly chosen and sworn . <PARA> ( e ) appeals . \u2014 an affirmative vote of three - fifths of the members of the senate , duly chosen and sworn , shall be required in the senate to sustain an appeal of the ruling of the chair on a point of order raised under this paragraph . <PARA> ( e ) appeals . \u2014 an affirmative vote of three - fifths of the members of the senate , duly chosen and sworn , shall be required in the senate to sustain an appeal of the ruling of the chair on a point of order raised under this paragraph .",

        "text": "<MASK> : few beverages have been as successful as gatorade , a carbohydrate - electrolyte sports drink favored by athletes performing at all levels of endeavor \u2014 from weekend warriors and sometimes - exercisers right up to professional players and olympic hopefuls . from its humble beginnings almost four decades ago , gatorade has grown to command 80 to 90 percent of north america \u2019 s sports drink market . <PARA> gatorade was formulated in 1965 by researchers at the university of florida in an effort to help the then - struggling florida gators football team . <PARA> dehydration was taking its toll on the players , who were fated to contest their home games in the heat and humidity of the florida swamp . the new beverage helped counteract the debilitating dehydration far better than pure water had , turning the gators into an effective second - half team . fueled by gatorade , in 1967 the gators won their first orange bowl . <PARA> other athletes who tried the drink soon swore by it , <MASK> it helped them go longer and finish stronger . but it was the kansas city chiefs of the late 1960s who brought what had previously been a little - known sports beverage to national prominence . like the gators , chiefs players were struggling with the effects of heat and humidity , albeit in missouri . ray graves , coach of the gators , told hank stram , the chiefs \u2019 coach , about the dramatic results his players were experiencing thanks to the invigorating concoction . a few cases of gatorade were shipped to the chiefs to try , and the same dramatic improvements in energy levels and performance were noted in their players . the chiefs made gatorade a part of their lives , winning the 1969 - 1970 championship with a 23 - 7 victory over the minnesota vikings in super bowl iv with gatorade at their <PARA> side . <PARA> gatorade came to be commercially produced after one of its developers at university of florida moved to indiana in 1967 , where he met a vice - president for stokely - van camp , a national company which produces canned and frozen fruits and vegetables . stokely - van camp secured the rights to gatorade from the university of florida and its researchers , and began marketing the drink nationwide . in 1983 quaker oats bought out stokely - van camp , and gatorade became a member of the pepsico family when quaker oats merged with the beverage giant in 2001 . <PARA> the success of the drink has brought fame but also fortune to university of florida . gatorade has fetched more than $ 80 million in royalties for the school since 1973 , when a series of legal disputes resulted in the creation of the gatorade trust for the benefit of the <MASK> inventors and the school . these monies have made numerous research projects possible in a wide array of disciplines . <PARA> the drink itself has changed little since its invention . it is still a combination of carbohydrates ( sucrose , glucose , and fructose ) and electrolytes ( potassium and sodium ). the first batch brewed by those long ago scientists is reported to have been rather nasty , but the addition of lemon juice made it drinkable . today \u2019 s gatorade is a sweet - tasting drink . <PARA> gatorade has since become an integral part of a number of sports , even beyond its use as a potable . coaches of winning football teams are routinely doused with barrels of it at the conclusion of games , with the baptism by gatorade having become almost a ritual . <PARA> barbara \u201c is it in you ?\u201d mikkelson",

( the lp actually appeared as a deity / reprise record , since the faux review had listed it as a deity release , and a single \u2014 i can \u2019 t get no nookie b / w cow pie \u2014 was issued as deity 0870 .) <PARA> even though the record bore no pictures of the \u201c masked marauders \u201d ( the cover merely featured a photograph of a woman ) and contained no identifying information about them on its outer sleeve , it \u2019 s hard to believe that even those who hadn \u2019 t read the review could have been taken in by the hoax . mick jagger complaining \u201c i can \u2019 t get no nookie \u201d? bob dylan warbling the 50 \u2019 s doo - wop classic \u201c duke of earl \u201d and donovan \u2019 s \u201c season of the witch \u201d? <PARA> buyers who still didn \u2019 t get it should have been clued in by an inner sheet included with the record that clearly spelled out the whole thing was a put - on ( and even if that was missing , the album \u2019 s closing track all but screamed \u201c this is a joke \u201d). nonetheless , fans avidly sought out the record , and people <PARA> swore they recognized jagger \u2019 s voice or mccartney \u2019 s bass playing and couldn \u2019 t possibly be mistaken . <PARA> mistaken they were , and eventually rolling stone itself exposed the whole thing . that the public \u2019 s gullibility knew no bounds was demonstrated all over again several years later , when the 1976 debut album by a group of canadian studio players called klaatu , which similarly lacked any photographs or information about the group itself , was widely <MASK> to have been a new beatles album . <PARA> an odd postscript to this <MASK> would be to note that in 1988 , george harrison formed a marauders - like band named the traveling wilburys with bob dylan , tom petty , roy orbison , and jeff lynne , all of whom were identified with pseudonyms using the surname \u2018 wilbury \u2019 on the album sleeve . <PARA> additional information : hear a bit of the marauders and their mick jagger sound - alike performing \u201c i can \u2019 t get no nookie \u201d:",

( the ashley flores e - mail itself lifted phrases from previous missing child hoax e - mails , such as christopher john mineo and kelsey brooke jones .) <PARA> some obvious clues point to this appeal \u2019 s being a prank rather than a genuine missing child alert : <PARA> staff sergeant rick williams <PARA> wichita falls police dept . <PARA> 1007 n . elm st . <PARA> wichita falls , texas 76310 <PARA> ( 940 ) 696 - 3671 <PARA> fax ( 940 ) 691 - 6346 <PARA> please look at the picture , read what his mother says , then forward this message on . <PARA> please look at the picture , read what his mother says , then forward this message on . <PARA> that block of information is also part of the hoax . there isn \u2019 t a staff sergeant rick williams with that particular police force , the address given doesn \u2019 t correspond with the official one given for the wichita falls police department ( 610 holliday ), and the phone number provided is registered not to the police in that city but to tammy trembley who lives in wichita falls , texas .

        "text": "partisan sources primarily on the right \u2014 including president donald trump \u2014 allege that many thousands ( trump <MASK> \u201c millions \u201d) of undocumented immigrants voted illegally in the 2016 presidential election . <PARA> no <MASK> exists to support these <MASK> . an advisory commission impaneled by president trump to investigate election fraud in 2017 was disbanded less than a year later without having demonstrated that large - scale voting abuse occurred . as of august 2018 , the u . s . department of justice ( doj ) had charged a total of 19 foreign nationals with voting illegally in the 2016 federal election . academic studies have shown that voter fraud in general is a rarity in u . s . elections . <PARA> trump and his supporters have nevertheless kept up a drumbeat of alarm over the prospect of non - citizens illegally voting , with the president declaring as recently as january 2019 that immigrant voter fraud is \u201c rampant \u201d across the united <MASK> . in april and may 2019 , a number of posts and memes shared on social media <MASK> that a federal law passed in 1996 requires that any non - citizen caught voting must be deported : <PARA> the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of 1996 ( iirira ) did contain two provisions specifically addressing voting by non - citizens (\u201c aliens \u201d). the first made it a federal crime for non - citizens to vote in elections involving candidates for national office . the second <MASK> that any non - citizen who voted in violation of any federal , <MASK> , or local law was both \u201c excludable \u201d and \u201c deportable .\u201d both of the <MASK> enacted in the legislation were revised and clarified over time but have not been repealed . <PARA> in its current form , 18 u . s . code section 611 declares it unlawful for aliens to vote in federal elections , with certain carefully demarcated exceptions : <PARA> apart from this <MASK> , federal law doesn \u2019 t expressly prohibit non - citizens from voting , though the laws of all 50 individual <MASK> do ( which has been the case since 1926 ). thus , with the exception of a very few municipalities in certain <MASK> where local ordinances allow non - citizens to vote in school board elections or on other local matters , it is illegal for non - citizens to vote in the united <MASK> . <PARA> for someone convicted of violating the federal prohibition on non - citizens voting in national elections , section 611 imposes a fine and / or imprisonment of up to one year . however , it does not address the subject of deportation , which is covered under another u . s . <MASK> and applies to aliens who violate <MASK> and local voting regulations as well as federal ones . <PARA> 8 u . s . code section 1227 (\u201c deportable aliens \u201d) lists the classes of non - citizens present in the united <MASK> who \u201c shall , upon the order of the attorney general , be removed .\u201d unlawful voting is covered in subsection 6 : <PARA> practically speaking , \u201c deportable \u201d in this instance doesn \u2019 t mean precisely the same thing as \u201c must be deported .\u201d non - citizens found guilty of so - called \u201c aggravated felonies \u201d ( such as murder , sex crimes , drug trafficking , etc .) are subject to automatic , mandatory removal from the country , but non - citizens convicted solely of unlawful voting ( unless they falsified citizenship documents for that purpose , which could result in an aggravated felony charge ) are entitled to a hearing before an immigration judge if deportation proceedings are initiated against them . the judge must rule , based on the <MASK> and consideration of the non - citizen \u2019 s application for relief or protection from removal ( if any ), whether to proceed with deportation . <PARA> that said , the permissible exceptions ( as cited in the <MASK> above ) are quite narrow . the only conditions under which it is not a deportable crime for a non - citizen to vote are when the act occurred in a local election where permitted by local law , or when the non - citizen is the child of u . s . citizens , has been a legal permanent resident since before the age of 16 , and reasonably believed at the time of the violation that they possessed citizenship . the latter exception aside , recent cases have demonstrated that neither the reasonable belief that one was a citizen at the time one voted nor unawareness that it is illegal to vote as a non - citizen is likely to spare someone convicted of the crime from deportation . <PARA> so , while deportation is neither automatic nor a certainty in unlawful voting cases involving non - citizens , it is by law a deportable offense , and the most likely outcome if proceedings are initiated by the government is removal from the country . \u201c illegal voting makes a person ineligible for citizenship , may cause them to lose their green card if they have one , and can put them into deportation proceedings where they may not have any ability to get relief from being ordered removed ,\u201d william a . stock , the national president of the american immigration lawyers association , told us . \u201c it puts any non - citizen on the path to deportation and restricts most of the ways to get off that path .\u201d",

checkers : the single - source , self - reported , uncorroborated implausible <MASK> . and not only was that <MASK> reminiscent of several other familiar arachnid - based urban legends that have circulated for more than <PARA> a century , such as those about spiders living or laying eggs under human skin , but the reporting agency ( australian northern territory \u2019 s nt news ) is one akin to america \u2019 s national enquirer or weekly world news : the online version of a tabloid that publishes silly , sensationalized <MASK> such as \u201c obama gets croc insurance ,\u201d \u201c frog gets struck down by lightning ,\u201d and \u201c best man left bleeding after being hit in eye by flying dildo .\u201d ( the <MASK> has since been published by more staid news sources as well .) <PARA> we \u2019 ve found no documented cases of spiders living and burrowing under human skin , or even any information suggesting that such an occurrence is possible . christopher buddle , an associate professor at mcgill university \u2019 s department of natural resource sciences , addressed thomas \u2019 <MASK> in an e - mail , saying the <MASK> didn \u2019 t match with what we know about spider behavior : <PARA> i think this is extremely suspect , unusual , and likely not possible . simply put : it is not plausible and i can think of no valid reason why a spider might \u2018 crawl beneath skin through a scar \u2019. the <MASK> that it was \u2018 feeding and moving up through the scar tissue \u2019 defies logic and defies what we know about the biology of spiders . i am also sceptical because the \u2018 <MASK> \u2019 ( the spider itself ) is not presented . <PARA> as noted , no corroborating information about this alleged medical case has been offered : no pictures of the skin - invading spider have been presented , no doctors involved in treating the patient have been <MASK> , and no witnesses to the spider removal other than dylan maxwell himself have been referenced . <PARA> perhaps there \u2019 s a germ of truth to this <MASK> that has been distorted through misdiagnosis or misunderstanding , but in the absence of any other <MASK> we remain extremely skeptical about the tale as presented .",

        "text": "several now - viral videos posted to twitter , facebook , and tiktok in may 2020 showed small insects crawling along the outside of strawberries after the fruit had been soaked in a saltwater solution . collectively , the videos received hundreds of thousands of views and sparked many questions about the methodology . <PARA> social media users filled a bowl with water and table salt . once the salt had dissolved , strawberries were said to have been submerged in the solution for \u201c about 30 minutes \u201d after which point small \u201c worms \u201d could be seen crawling around the outside of the berry . <PARA> though it is <MASK> that strawberries and other fruit may house small insects and the saltwater method is largely used by the agricultural industry as a way to detect such <MASK> , entomological experts at oregon <MASK> university told snopes that there is no scientific <MASK> that suggests a saltwater solution can , in fact , force pests out from infested berries . <PARA> the insect in question is an invasive flying pest called spotted wing drosophila ( swd ), or drosophila suzukii . endemic to asia , swd was first detected in north america in california in 2008 and has since spread to many regions of the united <MASK> where the insects are known to infect fruit crops and berries , according to michigan <MASK> university ( msu ). female flies lay their eggs in fruit where they will ultimately hatch into a delectable habitat prime for larval feeding . if the pest is not controlled through mitigation measures , msu adds that it is possible fruit may be harvested with larvae inside . <PARA> despite a lack of published scientific <MASK> , the saltwater method is one most often employed by commercial growers in order to determine whether an swd <MASK> has occurred , but berry lovers of any sort can also use it to detect creepy crawlies . <PARA> \u201c a backyard gardener can easily open up a suspect fruit and see 3 - to 5 - millimeter whitish larvae with the naked eye . larvae will move when exposed to light ,\u201d notes a guide published by oregon <MASK> university ( osu ). \u201c alternatively , a handful of fruit can be placed in a plastic bag , crushed , mixed with either a salt or vinegar solution , and then closely examined for larvae .\u201d <PARA> to do so , a salt or brown sugar solution should be prepared at least 24 hours before use to ensure that the salt or sugar dissolves entirely . add to 1 gallon of water a full cup of salt , or 2 . 5 cups of light brown sugar , and shake well \u2014 a well - dissolved solution increases the chance of larvae floating to the surface of the solution . fruit should be crushed and fully submerged in the solution , which will prompt larvae to exit , float to the surface and eventually drown . either sugar or salt will work , but the former will keep larvae alive longer and allow for a longer period of time to see movement . <PARA> although the saltwater method is used to detect pest <MASK> , experts note that it is largely unnecessary as commercial growers conduct rigorous testing to determine whether swd larvae are present before the fruit is accepted by stores . in fact , most fruit is known to contain small insects otherwise undetected by the human eye . [ as in the case of some of the circulated videos , some pests found on strawberries were not swd but likely small insects that live on the outside of the fruit .] <PARA> \u201c such washing with salt would not be necessary under [ sic ] these circumstances . strawberries are also quite porous , and i would not want to eat fruit that was soaked or washed in salty water ,\u201d said bernadine strik , a berry crops expert with the osu extension service . <PARA> testing fruit for insects is different than washing it , adds strik . according to the centers for disease control and prevention , water alone should suffice . if swd - infested berries are ingested , they are unlikely to do any harm . iowa <MASK> university extension and outreach notes that infested fruit is safe to eat , and ingestion poses no known risk to human health .",

        "text": "<MASK> : on 31 march 2006 , the orange county ( california ) register published several letters to the editor dealing with the subject of the immigration debate . one of those letters , by a reader named ernie lujan , was published under a heading of \u201c tear down lady liberty \u201d and read as follows : <PARA> illegal immigrants have been around since the early 1900 \u2019 s , except then they entered through ellis island in new york city . they came from countries such as italy , ireland , germany , poland and france . and now we accept them as <MASK> americans . <PARA> now these people whose ancestors came to this country to make a better life for themselves and their children want to build a great wall along the u . s . and mexico border and deny these hard - working people the same rights that their ancestors fought so hard and died for . <PARA> if you build this wall then you must also tear down the great <MASK> of liberty that sits in the new york harbor . <PARA> now these people whose ancestors came to this country to make a better life for themselves and their children want to build a great wall along the u . s . and mexico border and deny these hard - working people the same rights that their ancestors fought so hard and died for . <PARA> if you build this wall then you must also tear down the great <MASK> of liberty that sits in the new york harbor . <PARA> apparently another register reader penned a rebuttal to some of those immigration debate letters , one which was not published by the <PARA> newspaper and has instead been \u201c printed \u201d by her husband through the expedient of forwarding it via e - mail ( where it was circulated under the title of \u201c new immigrants \u201d). <PARA> this piece provides an apt illustration of the phenomenon that one can find in nearly every culture , in every era , a group of people who firmly believe that their civilization once experienced a golden age in which social conditions were much better ( if not perfect ), and modern society is an increasingly worsening corruption of that arcadian past . the trend continues today , as we commonly see responses to social , political , or economic issues that attempt to contrast the present with earlier eras , to hearken back to times when such problems were significantly amerliorated or simply did not exist . generally such reactions don \u2019 t ring <MASK> , referring not to the way things really used to be , but to idealized , mythical visions of the past couched in absolute terms . so it is with this letter , which attempts to contrast the \u201c modern immigrant \u201d with immigrants of a century ago , finding the former sadly lacking by comparison . as usual , it references a black - and - white past that never existed . <PARA> yes , many of the immigrants who streamed through ellis island into the united <MASK> around the turn of the century worked hard , obeyed the laws , did their best to learn english ( and otherwise become assimiliated into american culture ), raised children who willingly took up arms to defend their adoptive country in times of crisis , and made their way in the world ( and perhaps even prospered ) with little or no help from the government or anyone outside their immediate families and circles of acquaintances . however , plenty of immigrants in that same era did not fit that mold , such as those who : <PARA> what this piece illustrates is not so much substantive differences between \u201c old immigrants \u201d and \u201c new immigrants ,\u201d but rather the truthfulness of the proverb \u201c plus ca change , plus c \u2019 est la meme chose .\u201d",

        "text": "in february 2020 , after former film producer harvey weinstein was convicted of raping one woman and sexually assaulting another , an old video re - emerged online which appeared to show former first lady michelle obama praising weinstein as \u201c a wonderful human being .\u201d <PARA> obama \u2019 s remarks , and a short accompanying video clip , were promulgated chiefly by right - leaning , pro - trump twitter accounts , as shown below . the footage shows her describing weinstein as \u201c a wonderful human being \u201d and \u201c a good friend .\u201d <PARA> michelle obama did indeed once describe weinstein as a \u201c wonderful human being .\u201d the footage and remarks included in those social media posts were authentic and unedited . however , many posts did not include an important piece of context \u2014 obama made those remarks in 2013 , four years before dozens of women first publicly accused weinstein of rape , sexual assault , sexual harassment , and various other sexual improprieties . as a result , her praise of weinstein should not be interpreted as an endorsement of his offenses . <PARA> the former first lady was speaking in the east room of the white house on nov . 8 , 2013 , at a student film symposium . towards the beginning of her speech , she emphatically thanked weinstein for his role in \u201c organizing \u201d the event : <PARA> \u201c i want to start by thanking harvey weinstein for organizing this amazing day . [ audience applauds ]. harvey . this is possible because of harvey . he is a wonderful human being , a good friend , and just a powerhouse . and the fact that he and his team took the time to make this happen for all of you should say something , not about me or about this place , but about you [ points to audience ]. we are here because of you .\u201d <PARA> weinstein himself was present at the event , seated behind obama while she spoke : <PARA> the official transcript of obama \u2019 s full remarks can be read here . the obama white house website described the event as providing high school students from washington d . c ., boston , and new york \u201c an opportunity to learn about animation , special effects , makeup , costume , directing , music and sound effects , and heard from leaders in the film industry about how their education helped them succeed .\u201d <PARA> participants in the event included whoopi goldberg , blake lively , naomie harris , and \u201c cbs this morning \u201d host gayle king . <PARA> before beginning her college education at harvard university in the fall of 2017 , the obamas \u2019 eldest daughter malia worked as an intern for the weinstein company , according to news reports and court records . that was before october 2017 , when dozens of women first began to come forward to publicly accuse the influential producer of a range of sexual offenses across several decades , including rape , sexual assault , and sexual harassment . <PARA> although weinstein \u2019 s behavior had been the subject of <MASK> and speculation within the film industry for several years , it seems unlikely that the obamas had full knowledge of the allegations against him , given malia \u2019 s work placement just months before those stories first broke publicly . in light of michelle obama \u2019 s glowing tribute to weinstein in november 2013 , it seems equally unlikely that she was aware of his offenses at that time . we contacted the office of barack and michelle obama , asking when the former first lady first became aware of those allegations , but we did not receive a response in time for publication .",

        "text": "<MASK> : public awareness of what we now term <PARA> \u201c subliminal advertising \u201d began with the 1957 publication of vance packard \u2019 s book , the hidden persuaders . although packard did not use the term \u201c subliminal advertising ,\u201d he did describe many of the new \u201c motivational research \u201d marketing techniques being employed to sell products in the burgeoning post - war american market . advertisements that focused on consumers \u2019 hopes , fears , guilt , and sexuality were designed to persuade them to buy products they \u2019 d never realized they needed . marketers who could reach into the hearts and minds of american consumers soon found consumers \u2019 wallets to be within easy grasp as well . <PARA> it was james vicary who coined the term \u201c subliminal advertising .\u201d vicary had conducted a variety of unusual studies of female shopping habits , discovering ( among other things ) that women \u2019 s eye - blink rates dropped significantly in supermarkets , that \u201c psychological spring \u201d lasts more than twice as long as \u201c psychological winter ,\u201d and that \u201c the experience of a woman baking a cake could be likened to a woman giving birth .\u201d vicary \u2019 s studies were largely forgettable , save for one experiment he conducted at a ft . lee , new jersey movie theater during the summer of 1957 . vicary placed a tachistoscope in the theater \u2019 s projection booth , and all throughout the playing of the film picnic , he flashed a couple of different messages on the screen every five seconds . the messages each displayed for only 1 / 3000th of a second at a time , far below the viewers \u2019 threshold of conscious perceptibility . the result of displaying these imperceptible suggestions \u2014 \u201c drink coca - cola \u201d and \u201c hungry ? eat popcorn \u201d \u2014 was an amazing 18 . 1 % increase in coca - cola sales , and a whopping 57 . 8 % jump in popcorn purchases . thus was demonstrated the awesome power of \u201c subliminal advertising \u201d to coerce unwary buyers into making purchases they would not otherwise have <PARA> considered . <PARA> or so goes the legend that has retained its potency for more than forty years , which includes the belief the federal communications commission banned \u201c subliminal advertising \u201d from radio and television airwaves in 1974 , despite that fact that no studies had shown it to be effective , and even though its alleged efficacy was based on a fraud . <PARA> you see , vicary lied about the results of his experiment . when he was challenged to repeat the test by the president of the psychological corporation , dr . henry link , vicary \u2019 s duplication of his <MASK> experiment produced no significant increase in popcorn or coca - cola sales . eventually vicary confessed that he had falsified the data from his first experiments , and some critics have since expressed doubts that he actually conducted his infamous ft . lee experiment at all . <PARA> as usual , the media ( and thereby the public ) paid attention only to the sensational <MASK> <MASK> , and the scant coverage given to vicary \u2019 s later confession was ignored or quickly forgotten . radio and television <MASK> began airing subliminal commercials , leading to two congressional bills to ban the practice being introduced in 1958 and 1959 ( both of which died before being voted upon ). in 1973 , dr . wilson b . key picked up where vicary left off , publishing subliminal seduction , an indictment of modern advertisements filled with hidden messages and secret symbols \u2014 messages and symbols that only dr . key could discern ( including the notorious example of the word \u201c s - e - x \u201d spelled out in the ice cubes pictured in a liquor advertisement ). the old \u201c subliminal advertising \u201d controversy was stirred up again by dr . key \u2019 s book , leading to the 24 january 1974 announcement by the fcc that subliminal techniques , \u201c whether effective or not ,\u201d were \u201c contrary to the public interest ,\u201d and that any <MASK> employing them risked losing its broadcast license . <PARA> for neither the first nor the last time , a great deal of time and money and effort was expended on \u201c protecting \u201d the public from something that posed no danger to them . as numerous studies over the last few decades have demonstrated , subliminal advertising doesn \u2019 t work ; in fact , it never worked , and the whole premise was based on a lie from the very beginning . james vicary \u2019 s legacy was to ensure that a great many people will never be convinced otherwise , however . <PARA> sightings : the \u201c subliminal cut spurs popcorn sales \u201d is explicitly mentioned in a 1973 columbo movie (\u201c double exposure \u201c), and the acceptance of its principle as fact forms the basis of the episode .",

        "text": "in january 2019 , california <MASK> senator scott wiener ( d - san francisco ) introduced a bill ( sb - 145 ) to modify the <MASK> penal code to allow certain individuals convicted of sex offenses involving minors to apply for discretionary relief from having to register as sex offenders . the bill was passed by the legislature on aug . 31 , 2020 , and signed into law by gov . gavin newsom on sept . 11 . <PARA> the aim of the revised <MASK> , according to a 2019 press release from wiener \u2019 s office , is to redress the disparity between how heterosexual and lgbt sex offenders were treated under existing law : <PARA> a feb . 21 , 2019 <MASK> on the washington pundit website put a decidedly different spin on the proposal and foreshadowed the tone of the debate to follow . that <MASK> , entitled \u201c ca democrats introduce lgbtq bill that would protect pedophiles who rape children ,\u201d <MASK> : <PARA> these <MASK> were at best misleading and at worst <MASK> , beginning with the headline . the new law does not , under any reasonable interpretation , \u201c protect pedophiles who rape children .\u201d although the crimes addressed in sb - 145 fall under the heading of <MASK> rape ( given that the victims are under 18 , the <MASK> age of consent ), they do not include forcible sex crimes of any kind , as a spokesperson for sen . wiener , victor ruiz - cornejo , explained in an email : <PARA> moreover , it is not the case that the new law would , per the <MASK> \u2019 s <MASK> , \u201c allow a sex offender who lures a minor with the intent to commit a felony ( i . e ., a sex act ) the ability to escape registering as a sex offender as long as the offender is within 10 years of age of the minor .\u201d <PARA> the law doesn \u2019 t allow anyone to \u201c escape \u201d registering . rather , it allows people found guilty of unforced oral or anal intercourse with a minor 14 or older , if there is no more than 10 years \u2019 age difference between them , to apply to the court for the same discretionary relief from mandated sex - offender registration that is already afforded to those found guilty of vaginal intercourse with a minor . that is to say , a court will decide whether the offender must register , based on the facts of the case . <PARA> also , according to ruiz - cornejo , \u201c luring a minor \u201d for purposes of sex is not one of the crimes covered in the bill . \u201c senate bill 145 does not protect anyone from luring children ( under 14 years old ) or teenagers ( above 15 years old ) with the intent to commit sexual assault ,\u201d he told us <MORE> contacting a minor with intent to commit a felony ) or any substantive sex offense that would be appropriate , but any discretionary relief from mandatory registry provided for under section 288 . 3 would not apply to the luring charge under section 272 . <PARA> nothing in sb - 145 precludes a district attorney from filing a case in such a way as to prevent an individual who commits a sex offense against a minor under 14 from taking advantage of the discretionary relief provision , felizzatto said . \u201c those types of sex offenders are predatory and would not benefit from the changes in sb - 145 .\u201d <PARA> given that the second <MASK> paragraph of the washington pundit piece references \u201c existing law which already excludes lewd acts with children under 14 ,\u201d the paragraph that follows contains a blatant <MASK> , citing the example of \u201c a 22 - year - old luring a 12 - year - old \u201d to show how the proposed legislation supposedly \u201c shields \u201d child predators . <PARA> \u201c the bill does not apply to anyone under 14 years old ,\u201d ruiz - cornejo said when we showed him the passage . \u201c nor does the bill shield anyone , it simply grants the judge discretion .\u201d ( the washington pundit deleted the example and noted the correction after we contacted them to point out its inaccuracy .) <PARA> finally , the sentence \u201c sb - 145 , as currently written , appears to allow certain sexual predators to live among the population without anyone being aware \u201d simply repeats the erroneous <MASK> that discretionary relief will be granted to sexual predators . <PARA> we sought comment on the discrepancies in the <MASK> from the washington pundit \u2019 s publisher , who defended the website \u2019 s overall characterization of the bill . \u201c by eliminating the different treatments for vaginal vs oral and anal assaults , it doesn \u2019 t change the nature of the bill ,\u201d he said in an email . \u201c it actually expands on it and applies more protection to the pedophile . ( our definition of pedophile is an adult who sexually preys on children ).\u201d <PARA> he also stood by the <MASK> that the bill would \u201c protect pedophiles who rape children ,\u201d citing california \u2019 s age - of - consent law as a reason to ignore the distinction between forcible rape and \u201c consensual \u201d sex acts such as those that fall under the heading of <MASK> rape : <PARA> in march 2019 , wiener \u2019 s office issued an amended version of sb - 145 to clarify its intent and allay public confusion about which types of offenses were and were not included in the bill . after the bill finally became law in september 2020 , its provisions were once again widely misrepresented and assailed as \u201c pro - pedophilia .\u201d wiener called these <MASK> \u201c grossly disingenuous .\u201d",

( the use of \u201c cool paints \u201d would theoretically reduce the interior temperatures of automobiles , thereby lessening the demand for air conditioning .) as the board noted , a goal of 20 % reflectivity would be more difficult to achieve with dark - colored cars ( observing that \u201c jet black remains an issue , even at this level \u201d), so one potential implementation plan called for auto manufacturers to phase in one - third of their color palettes by the 2012 model year , with all colors having to meet the 20 % reflectivity goal by 2016 . <PARA> however , as the san jose mercury news reported , the carb never actually considered banning black cars , and all of the discussion about reflective paint requirements was merely part of a draft proposal which the arb ultimately decided against as not cost - effective : <PARA> \u201c it \u2019 s completely fallacious ,\u201d said stanley young , a spokesman for the <MASK> \u2019 s air resources board , the agency supposedly behind the ban . \u201c at no time was it mentioned , contemplated or proposed that <MORE> a significant number of vehicle colors \u201d because darker colors absorb more heat . even the arb itself , in a powerpoint presentation on the paint proposal , <MASK> , \u201c jet black remains an issue ,\u201d though it never said the color should be banned . <PARA> but eventually , the arb staff decided that the technology required to make car paint more reflective \u201c is not cost - effective \u201d today , and won \u2019 t be part of the new regulations , young said . <PARA> the carb has posted revised draft regulatory language for cool car standards and test procedures as of 27 march 2009 and <MASK> in a mailing list notice that : <PARA> of note , the proposal now specifies solar control requirements only for new vehicles windows ( glazing ). the <MASK> proposed regulation contained requirements for both vehicle paint and windows to improve their ability to reflect heat from the sun . the intent of the paint requirements was to introduce reflective paint ( currently used in architectural paints to keep houses and businesses cool ) into the automotive arena . the requirement was never at any point to limit consumer color choices or ban any colors . based on input from the automotive industry , paint , pigment suppliers , and comments from a public workshop held on <PARA> march 12th , arb staff has determined that a clear path to achieve solar reflectivity for the darker colors has not yet been identified . we are planning to address the paint - related portion of the proposal in a future regulatory action . <PARA> staff has also changed the glazing requirements from a reflective ( rds ) to a total solar transmission ( tts ) specification . this metric more closely aligns with the proposal \u2019 s goal of limiting solar transmission into the vehicle . in an effort to get the newest draft of the regulation out to stakeholders some numerical values are not currently indicated in the draft regulation . the intent is to provide the framework of various compliance options . the numerical value will be <PARA> specified in the final draft of the regulation which will be released 45 - days prior to the june 25 - 26 , 2009 board hearing . <PARA> staff has also changed the glazing requirements from a reflective ( rds ) to a total solar transmission ( tts ) specification . this metric more closely aligns with the proposal \u2019 s goal of limiting solar transmission into the vehicle . in an effort to get the newest draft of the regulation out to stakeholders some numerical values are not currently indicated in the draft regulation . the intent is to provide the framework of various compliance options . the numerical value will be <PARA> specified in the final draft of the regulation which will be released 45 - days prior to the june 25 - 26 , 2009 board hearing .",

        "text": "in the autumn of 2018 , controversy surrounded a caravan of thousands of migrants travelling mainly from honduras , but also from guatemala , towards mexico and the southern border of the united <MASK> . <PARA> president donald trump <MASK> ( without presenting <MASK> ) that the contingent included \u201c criminals and unknown middle easterners ,\u201d and as the caravan slowly approached mexico , some conservative opponents of illegal immigration stoked fears with <MASK> or misleading <MASK> that the migrants were burning u . s . flags , and that the caravan was a liberal conspiracy funded by the financier george soros . <PARA> public attention was also focused on the personal circumstances of some of the migrants and their motivations for travelling to the united <MASK> . like guatemala and el salvador , honduras is the site of rampant violence related to gangs and drug trafficking and has one of the highest murder rates in the world . <PARA> in june 2018 , the council on foreign relations , a non - partisan think tank with a focus on international affairs , wrote of this crisis that : <PARA> against that background , observers sympathetic to the plight of those who were part of the october 2018 caravan began sharing a meme which sought to reject an argument frequently made by those who opposed the migrants \u2019 right to enter the united <MASK> : that the migrants \u2019 actions were illegal . <PARA> on 22 october , the general board of church and society of the united methodist church , one of the largest christian denominations in the united <MASK> , posted the following meme to facebook : <PARA> the following day , the meme was further promoted ( in a modified format ) by the left - wing facebook page \u201c the other 98 %\u201d: <PARA> a convention in geneva vs . \u201c the geneva conventions \u201d <PARA> <MASK> 14 ( 1 ) of the 1948 universal declaration of human rights <MASK> : \u201c everyone has the right to seek and to enjoy in other countries asylum from persecution .\u201d <PARA> built on this foundation , the two major pieces of international law which set out the rights and obligations of countries as regards refugees and asylum - seekers are the 1951 convention relating to the <MASK> of refugees ( commonly known as the refugee convention ) and the 1967 protocol relating to the <MASK> of refugees . both documents can be found here . <PARA> the 1951 convention took place in geneva , switzerland , which occasionally prompts observers to refer to it as the \u201c geneva convention ,\u201d as the october 2018 meme does . however , \u201c geneva conventions \u201d should be reserved for describing a separate series of agreements signed in 1949 ( and afterwards ) which set out the humanitarian rules of war , placing obligations on countries around the treatment of wounded enemy combatants , prisoners of war , and so on <MORE> . <PARA> what the meme appears to be <MASK> is that if a migrant is fleeing violence , their entry into the united <MASK> is legal by virtue of the fact that they are fleeing violence . this is inaccurate . <PARA> whether a migrant is fleeing violence or persecution does not have a bearing on the legality or illegality of their entry into the united <MASK> , although obviously such factors could potentially form the basis of a successful asylum application later on . <PARA> the asylum application process <PARA> the procedures involved in requesting and getting asylum in the united <MASK> can be relatively complicated and time - consuming . however , based on guidelines published by the american immigration council and u . s . citizenship and immigration services ( uscis ), an agency of the department of homeland security , the following is a rough outline of how a migrant can obtain asylum in the united <MASK> : <PARA> \u2018 fleeing violence \u2019 <PARA> as we have outlined , the legality of a migrant \u2019 s entry or presence in the united <MASK> is determined by whether they have the correct authorization and documentation , and not whether or not they are fleeing violence or persecution in their home country . likewise , migrants have a right to apply for asylum in the u . s ., regardless of whether they entered or remained in the country legally or illegally . <PARA> however , it should be pointed out that fleeing gang violence of the kind often seen in honduras and guatemala , the home countries of those who joined the \u201c migrant caravan \u201d in october 2018 , may well not form the basis of a successful asylum application . <PARA> in june 2018 , attorney general jeff sessions published a major ruling which overturned a 2014 decision by the board of immigration appeals , relating to domestic abuse and gang violence as grounds for asylum . in brief , sessions ruled that asylum should be reserved for individuals who are suffering persecution or violence on the basis of their membership of a group that has a \u201c common immutable [ unchanging ] characteristic \u201d: <PARA> the attorney general drew a distinction between victims of group - based persecution and violence , and what he called \u201c victims of private criminal activity .\u201d on the question of gang violence , sessions wrote : <PARA> the american civil liberties union has challenged sessions \u2019 ruling in federal court , in a case that was still pending as of 25 october 2018 . <PARA> for the time being , however , the refugee convention alluded to in the united methodist church \u2019 s meme may not offer much protection or assistance to those central american migrants approaching the u . s . in the october 2018 caravan , even if they are fleeing violence , and regardless of whether they enter the country legally or illegally .",

<PARA> in june 2018 , then - new york attorney general barbara underwood sued the president , his son eric and daughter , ivanka , along with the donald j . trump foundation charity . underwood wrote that : <PARA> \u201c for more than a decade , the donald j . trump foundation has operated in persistent violation of <MASK> and federal law governing new york <MASK> charities . this pattern of illegal conduct by the foundation and its board members includes improper and extensive political activity , repeated and willful self - dealing transactions , and failure to follow basic fiduciary obligations or to implement even elementary corporate formalities required by law .\u201d <PARA> as a result , underwood asked the new york <MASK> supreme court to \u201c dissolve the foundation for its persistently illegal conduct , enjoin its board members from future service as a director of any not - for - profit authorized by new york law , to obtain restitution and penalties , and to direct the foundation to cooperate with the attorney general in the lawful distribution of its remaining assets to qualified charitable entities .\u201d <PARA> specifically , the attorney general asked the court to bar the president from running any new york - based charities for 10 years , and the other directors for one year . <PARA> in december 2018 , the attorney general and the defendants reached an agreement to dissolve the trump foundation and distribute its assets to a list of agreed charities . however , that agreement did not include underwood \u2019 s request that president trump , along with eric and ivanka , be barred from operating a new york - based non - profit organization in the future , for varying periods of time . <MORE> the case was subsequently resolved without those outright bans being implemented , and therefore we have change the rating to \u201c <MASK> .\u201d <PARA> did trump family members steal from a children \u2019 s cancer charity ? <PARA> the allegations involving members of the trump family and a children \u2019 s cancer charity are separate from the new york lawsuit against the trump foundation that sought to bar some of the family from running charities in that <MASK> . <PARA> amato \u2019 s viral tweet inappropriately conflated the two sets of allegations by <MASK> that the charity ban ( which was requested by the new york attorney general , but not granted by the court ) was the result of trump family members \u201c stealing \u201d from a children \u2019 s charity . <PARA> investigations by both the associated press in 2016 and forbes in 2017 found that the eric trump foundation had misled donors and mismanaged funds , funneling money into trump - owned businesses or other charities linked to the trump empire . <PARA> the associated press , for example , wrote that : <PARA> \u201c a charity operated by one of donald trump \u2019 s sons flouts philanthropic standards by financially benefiting charities connected to the trump family and members of the charity \u2019 s board , an associated press investigation shows . the ap found that eric trump has exaggerated the size of his foundation and the donations it receives . at the same time , the charity \u2019 s payments for services or donations to other groups repeatedly went to one of donald trump \u2019 s private golf clubs and to charities linked to the trumps by corporate , family or philanthropic relationships ...\u201d <PARA> among other <MASK> , the associated press alleged that : <PARA> the 2017 forbes <MASK> , which was included in amato \u2019 s widely shared tweet as a source , made similar <MASK> about the operations of the eric trump foundation . those allegations haven \u2019 t been tested in court and have not resulted in any legal action or prosecution . <PARA> it should also be noted that nobody involved is accused of \u201c stealing ,\u201d as such , with that word being understood in the conventional sense of meaning theft or embezzlement of funds . what is alleged is that the foundation engaged in misleading practices and that it inappropriately used donated funds to pay trump businesses \u2014 practices that could be regarded as \u201c self - dealing ,\u201d rather than theft or embezzlement . <PARA> in june 2018 , a spokesperson for then - new york attorney general underwood told the associated press that her office had opened an investigation looking specifically at the affairs of the eric trump foundation and st . jude \u2019 s research hospital . we asked the office of underwood \u2019 s successor what the <MASK> of that investigation was in october 2019 , but we did not receive a response .",

era rule that prohibits healthcare and insurance providers from discriminating against trans individuals . <PARA> so the source cited by onenewsnow did not involve warren saying , \u201c taxpayers must fund sex reassignment surgery .\u201d the phrasing of the website \u2019 s headline may have given some readers the impression it was a direct <MASK> , even though onenewsnow did not actually use <MASK> marks . it might also have led some to believe warren had proposed that all sex - reassignment surgeries must be taxpayer - funded , which is not the case . <PARA> nonetheless , an examination of the record , and confirmation from warren \u2019 s 2020 presidential campaign , make it clear that she does indeed support covering sex - reassignment surgery under taxpayer - funded programs like medicaid , as well as full legal access to the surgery , under private health insurance and obamacare . <PARA> we asked the warren campaign whether she supports gender - reassignment surgery , and other transition - related services such as medication , being made available at low cost or no cost , under taxpayer - funded programs such as medicare , medicaid , tricare ( for military service members and veterans ), as well as through obamacare and private health insurance policies . a campaign spokesperson was unequivocal in response : \u201c yes .\u201d <PARA> the campaign also directed us to a september 2019 interview warren conducted with \u201c hiv plus \u201d magazine , in which she gave further details about her stance on the issue . the interview refers to section 1557 of the affordable care act ( obamacare ), so a brief explanation is warranted . <PARA> section 1557 incorporated existing anti - discrimination law into the affordable care act ( aca ). it prohibited healthcare or insurance providers that receive federal funding ( include <MASK> - by - <MASK> medicaid programs ) from discriminating against patients on the basis of their sex , race , religion , national <MASK> , and so on . <PARA> in 2016 , hhs under president barack obama implemented a new rule that expanded those protections <MORE> identity which it defined as one \u2019 s internal sense of being \u2018 male , female , neither , or a combination of male and female .\u2019 in response to a subsequent lawsuit by several <MASK> and healthcare entities , on december 31 , 2016 , a federal court preliminarily enjoined the rule \u2019 s gender identity and termination of pregnancy provisions on a nationwide basis , finding them contrary to the applicable civil rights law , the religious freedom restoration act , and the administrative procedure act . <PARA> \u201c a second federal court agreed . because the preliminary injunction continues to be in effect , hhs cannot , and has not since the date of the injunction , enforced the rule \u2019 s provisions the court said are likely unlawful . the proposed rule would revise the provisions subject to those injunctions to conform with the plain understanding recognized by the court .\u201d <PARA> with that context and background in mind , the following is the most relevant exchange from warren \u2019 s september 2019 interview with \u201c hiv plus \u201d magazine : <PARA> warren \u2019 s declaration that she would as president \u201c direct hhs to interpret section 1557 under its 2016 guidance \u201d means she would enforce , once again , a set of rules that mean sex - reassignment surgery would be covered under federal programs such as medicare , medicaid , and tricare , including <MASK> - by - <MASK> medicaid programs . <PARA> as such , it is accurate to <MASK> that warren does propose and has proposed that taxpayers should cover the cost of some sex - reassignment surgeries , as they do other treatments and services , under those programs . <PARA> warren was also one of 31 u . s . senators who signed on to a june 2019 letter to trump \u2019 s hhs , which opposed and criticized the proposed reversal of the 2016 anti - discrimination enhancements . warren was joined in signing that latter by fellow presidential candidates and u . s . senators kamala harris , kirsten gillibrand , bernie sanders , amy klobuchar , and cory booker . <PARA> warren has therefore put on the record , several times in 2019 , her support for sex - reassignment surgery being included among the treatments and services covered under taxpayer - funded programs , as well as under obamacare and private health insurance policies . <PARA> however , the onenewsnetwork headline had a tendency to mislead some readers who may have interpreted its phrasing to mean that warren had said , word - for - word , \u201c taxpayers must fund sex reassignment surgery ,\u201d or that she had advocated taxpayers must fund any and all sex reassignment surgery , rather than simply adding one more procedure to the list of procedures taxpayers already fund under medicaid and similar federal programs . <PARA> as such , we issue a rating of \u201c mostly <MASK> .\u201d",

19 vaccine candidates , prompting widespread optimism about the availability of a safe and effective vaccine for the virus , perhaps even before the end of the year . <PARA> on dec . 2 , 2020 , the u . k . government gave emergency authorization for the distribution and application of the vaccine created by pfizer and a smaller german company called biontech . the distribution was scheduled to start during the week of dec . 7 . <PARA> biontech was founded by ugur sahin and \u00f6zlem t\u00fcreci , two immunologists and cancer researchers who also happen to be a married couple . their striking personal <MASK> became the focus of news coverage in late 2020 , and their achievements were described by some as an \u201c immigrant success <MASK> \u201d \u2014 sahin was born in turkey and immigrated to german with his family at the age of 4 , while t\u00fcreci was born in germany to a turkish immigrant father . <PARA> in november and december 2020 , social media users enthusiastically shared an old photograph of what they said was sahin \u2019 s family , <MASK> that \u201c the boy in the yellow t - shirt \u201d would later go on to lead the team that created the pfizer / biontech covid - 19 vaccine : <PARA> in one instance , another user <MASK> the photograph showed a family of romanian immigrants . <PARA> these widely shared posts were misleading . sahin and his family did immigrate to germany from turkey when he was a young child . but sahin \u2019 s family is not shown in the photograph in question , and sahin is not the boy in the yellow t - shirt . the widely shared tweet that referred to a romanian family in germany was entirely inaccurate . <PARA> as <MASK> reported by the turkish fact - checking website teyit , the picture in question was taken by the german photographer candida h\u00f6fer . it was featured in a 2016 collection of h\u00f6fer \u2019 s photographs , entitled \u201c t\u00fcrken in deutschland \u201d (\u201c turks in germany \u201d). <PARA> another of h\u00f6fer \u2019 s photographs shows just the mother and father from the family in question : <PARA> in august 2020 , diasporat\u00fcrk \u2014 an online community dedicated to collecting stories <MORE> verify sahin \u2019 s precise date of birth ( wikipedia <MASK> variously he was born on sept . 19 or sept . 29 , 1965 ) but an august 2016 news <MASK> gave his age as 50 , and the new york times reported in november 2020 that he was 55 years old . <PARA> as such , sahin would have been either 9 or 10 years old in 1975 , when h\u00f6fer \u2019 s photograph of a turkish family in d\u00fcsseldorf was taken . it \u2019 s possible the boy in the yellow shirt was that old , at that time , but it \u2019 s unlikely . <PARA> furthermore , as teyit correctly pointed out , the new york times noted in its profile of sahin and t\u00fcreci that sahin had left the city of iskenderun , turkey , whereas the family from the photograph emigrated from aksaray , some 170 miles away . <PARA> some social media posts and online <MASK> including the photograph of the family described them specifically as turkish muslim immigrants . we have not yet been able to determine sahin \u2019 s person religious convictions , if any , so this element of the narrative surrounding both the photograph , and sahin \u2019 s personal background , remains unclear . in november 2019 , sahin was the recipient of a mustafa prize , an iranian - administered award for scientists in the islamic world . <PARA> eligible nominees must either be professed muslims from anywhere in the world , or scientists of any religious persuasion from one of 57 muslim - majority nations ( including sahin \u2019 s native turkey ). as a result , sahin \u2019 s personal religious convictions cannot be deduced from his winning a mustafa prize in 2019 . <PARA> although the family shown in the photograph is not sahin \u2019 s , and the boy in the yellow shirt is not him , the milieu it depicted may well have been similar to the one in which sahin grew up . according to multiple reports , sahin \u2019 s father \u2014 like the father of the \u201c boy in the yellow t - shirt \u201d \u2014 immigrated to germany as a gastarbeiter (\u201c guest worker \u201d) in a ford factory in cologne . both men <MASK> arrived by themselves , before their respective families later joined them . <PARA> the purpose of the guest - worker programs was to bring an influx of skilled labor into germany in order to revive the german economy in the 1960s and 1970s . workers were <MASK> intended to stay for only two years , before returning to their countries of <MASK> , but the rules were later changed and allowed for family reunification in germany . <PARA> so in the case of sahin and the boy in the yellow shirt , their families \u2019 journey in german society began under the same legal mechanisms , and in similarly modest circumstances .",

( although it was attributed to \u201c john tabb ,\u201d an earlier version was credited to \u201c jeffery rightmire .\u201d) <PARA> as is often the case with e - mail polemics focused on purported welfare abuse and taxpayer outrage , the \u201c new american way of life \u201d offers an implausible , far - fetched scenario to condemn those who use public assistance to make ends meet : <PARA> points 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and 5 of the forward pertain to the imagined generosity of the housing program colloquially called \u201c section 8 ,\u201d the u . s department of housing and urban development \u2019 s ( hud ) assistance program that provides very low - income families with subsidized vouchers they can use towards paying a portion of their monthly rent . <PARA> while section 8 is frequently derided in the fashion referenced above , it \u2019 s very difficult to play the system in the manner described due to the low supply versus tremendous demand for housing and vouchers among those in need of it . applicants typically have to spend years on waiting lists before section 8 housing becomes available , and in many cases it takes years to even get one \u2019 s name on a waiting list in the first place . waiting lists for the program close to new applicants for years at a time on a not - infrequent basis , as a 24 august 2015 <MASK> in the albuquerque journal reported : <PARA> so it \u2019 s extremely unlikely the baby daddy landlord in this hypothetical scenario could simply make a residence available for the section 8 program and then immediately rent it to the tenant of his choosing . he \u2019 d typically have to wait years for his preferred renter ( i . e ., his girlfriend ) to get on a section 8 waiting list , then more years for her to work her way to the top of the list , before he could double - dip by getting the government to subsidize his girlfriend \u2019 s paying him rent to live in a house he owns . the baby daddy in this scenario ( one who can afford to buy his own house ) would probably be far better off financially if he simply lived in the house with his girlfriend , or rented it out to someone other than his girlfriend . <PARA> there is a persistent misperception that the patient protection and affordable care act ( also known as ppaca , the aca <MORE> one of the two children as a dependent , than the mother can \u2019 t be legally collecting benefits ( such as snap ) for both children . <PARA> for starters , one cannot simply declare herself to be mentally ill or have back problems , then sit back and collect disability payments for the rest of her ( working ) life . such <MASK> have to be documented by medical professionals as genuinely disabling conditions , and even then those living with disabilities find that securing benefits isn \u2019 t quite so easy . presuming the woman in this anecdote is fairly young , she would have to have accrued sufficient work credits to qualify for lifelong disability payments ( an unlikely scenario ), and then she would still have to meet separate criteria for a qualifying condition ( which precludes having earned more than $ 1 , 090 per month in that year ). the condition under which a person qualifies also must be one that limits ability to do any other work : <PARA> according to data from the agency , more than half of disability <MASK> are denied , and the wait for hearings has increased ( partly due to an aging pool of applicants ). the anecdotal <MASK> \u2019 s purported plundering of disability benefits also conflicts with her concurrent sponging of educational grants , as the usefulness of the latter is negated by the former : a full - time student wouldn \u2019 t qualify for lifelong disability payments , and college would be unnecessary for the matriarch of a household who intended to remain home for life collecting benefits for her fabricated disability . <PARA> as the excerpt above concludes , the figures bandied about in the e - mail encompass virtually all programs available to low - income americans and extrapolates the fictional family described routinely accesses all of them . some of the benefits described ( such as free college for single mothers or free utility programs ) don \u2019 t seem to exist , and several of forms of assistance ( such as section 8 or disability ) are not administered in the simplistic manner suggested by this item . <PARA> furthermore , while this item asserts that the complex welfare hustling plan described here is \u201c perfectly legal ,\u201d several aspects of it involve defrauding the system in an expressly prohibited ( and largely criminal ) fashion . were any family to hide assets or lie about household income on application forms , they would be subject to severe penalties and prosecution should their perfidy be unraveled . the scheme also rests upon the ( fallacious ) notion that access to assistance programs is easy to both maintain and retain . <PARA> finally , the causes of the national debt are fairly complex . however , social security , medicare / medicaid , and defense broadly account for most government spending . <PARA> <MASK> published : 31 august 2015",

paid cellphone , also citing privacy laws . <PARA> on housing , cambridge officials and the family \u2019 s landlord ducked questions on whether the brothers were ever on section 8 assistance . <PARA> the public paid for tamerlan tsarnaev \u2019 s attorney when the russian national successfully fought criminal charges in 2009 that he battered a former girlfriend . <PARA> the [ governor \u2019 s ] administration clamped down the lid on herald requests for details of tamerlan tsarnaev \u2019 s government benefits , citing the dead terror mastermind \u2019 s right to privacy . <PARA> across the board , <MASK> agencies flatly refused to provide information about the taxpayer - funded lifestyle for the 26 - year - old man and his brother and accused accomplice dzhokhar tsarnaev , 19 . <PARA> on ebt card <MASK> or spending , <MASK> welfare spokesman alec loftus would only say tamerlan tsarnaev , his wife and 3 - year - old daughter received benefits that ended in 2012 . he declined further comment . <PARA> on unemployment compensation , labor department spokesman kevin franck refused to say whether tamerlan tsarnaev ever collected , saying it was \u201c confidential and not a matter of public record .\u201d <PARA> on dzhokhar tsarnaev \u2019 s college aid , university of massachusetts dartmouth spokesman robert connolly said , \u201c it is our position \u2014 and i believe the accepted position in higher education \u2014 that student records including academic records and financial records ( including financial aid ) cannot under federal law be released without a student \u2019 s consent .\u201d <PARA> on cellphones , the federal communications commission would not say whether either brother had a government -

        "text": "a popular <MASK> that has been in circulation online since at least 2010 is one that involves long - haired native americans serving as scouts in the vietnam war . the earliest mention of the tale we found was an 8 december 2010 post from the self - described \u201c indiana jones of the superfoods and longevity universe ,\u201d david \u2018 avocado \u2019 wolfe . <PARA> as the <MASK> goes , a woman married to a veterans affairs medical hospital psychologist caught wind ( via her husband ) of top secret information about how the military recruited scouts on native american reservations for the vietnam war . but once the scouts \u2019 hair was cut to regulation military length , they lost their preternatural tracking skills . later tests showed that long , flowing hair was an essential component of those skills : <PARA> the author of the tale attempted to explain a possible scientific rationale for such an occurrence : <PARA> this <MASK> presented two separate areas in need of fact - checking : the historical <MASK> that the united <MASK> military recruited native americans as scouts during the vietnam era and later commissioned a study to find out why they were not performing as expected , and the scientific <MASK> that hair functioned as an aid in military scouting activities . <PARA> the historical account given here is dubious at best , and the <MASK> that it stemmed from a \u201c secret \u201d project challenges us to prove a negative . logical fallacies notwithstanding , the confirmable facts are that numerous native american soldiers served in vietnam , a large majority of whom volunteered for their service before being drafted and were integrated into regular units , and no historical accounts exist of specialized scouting units composed of long - haired native american soldiers . <PARA> we reached out to the military regarding the possibility that such a program may have occurred , and f . lee reynolds with the united <MASK> army center of military <MASK> provided us with the following <MASK> : <PARA> an actual united <MASK> military project to recruit scouts from a specific ethnic group did exist , but the targeted group was viet cong defectors recruited to serve as intelligence scouts . this setup makes a good deal more sense relative to the native american <MASK> , given the viet cong \u2019 s actual knowledge of the land and its inhabitants . <PARA> the scientific <MASK> are no less dubious . while it is borderline accurate to say that hair plays a role in the nervous system , that does not mean it serves as some sort of \u201c antenna \u201d into the ineffable aspects of our own consciousness . the reality is a bit less grandiose , according to the new england journal of medicine : <PARA> in other words , the two primary functions hair has on a sensory level are to signal physical movement of the hair and to detect pathogens . in both cases , however , it is not the hair itself that is talking to the nervous or immune systems , but the cells of the follicle to which the hair is attached . it is unclear how the subtle movement of one \u2019 s hair or the ability to detect pathogens via the scalp would have any bearing on scouting in the vietnam war . <PARA> the <MASK> <MASK> on this subject went on to <MASK> that hair both emits and receives electromagnetic signals to and from the brain : <PARA> the notion that hair emits electromagnetic energy is demonstrably <MASK> . hair is a terrible conductor of electricity and is actually comparable in electrical resistivity to rubber , which commonly used to protect against the flow of an electric current . other less well - defined terms such \u201c intuition \u201d are harder to refute , but it should be noted that not a single version of this <MASK> provided any sort of mechanism outside of the implausible and vague notion of electromagnetic signals . <PARA> kirlian photography , the only piece of \u201c <MASK> \u201d provided for the nebulous <MASK> of hair as an intuition antenna , is a common topic on new age , alternative health , and metaphysical websites . in broad terms , it is a collection of techniques used to photograph an electric field , which new age and alternative health practitioners sometimes describe as an \u201c aura \u201d that is medically or spiritually informative . <PARA> science finds no support for such a <MASK> , however . any differences in a before / after photographs of hair would almost certainly represent nothing more than the moisture content of the hair or lack thereof , as later studies into the topic revealed . <PARA> as native american writer and creator of the blog \u201c native skeptic \u201d noah nez wrote on a post for the center for inquiry , hair plays an important role in many tribes \u2019 religious beliefs , but those views have often been co - opted by various new age movements : <PARA> this fanciful tale relies on the unsourced and unverifiable <MASK> from a website that frequently peddles highly shareable stories having little to no scientific legitimacy , and it appears that the tale of long - haired native american scouts in vietnam belongs to that genre . not a single piece of historical <MASK> supports the <MASK> of native american scout recruitment by the u . s . military , and no scientific <MASK> that holds up to any level of scrutiny supports the idea of heightened intuition resulting from longer hair .",

        "text": "the release of the film american sniper ( based on the autobiographical book american sniper : the autobiography of the most lethal sniper in u . s . military <MASK> ) on 16 january 2015 brought the late chris kyle \u2019 s <MASK> to a wide audience . while the former navy seal achieved a fair degree of fame before his death in february 2013 , the release of the movie based on his book prompted renewed interest in both the events it depicted and other <MASK> kyle made during his lifetime . <PARA> three particular incidents kyle maintained he was involved in have caused the most controversy . they are : <PARA> chris kyle \u2019 s <MASK> he \u2019 d fired upon and killed dozens of \u201c looters \u201d after hurricane katrina hit new orleans in 2005 preceded the other two tales . the <MASK> circulated through postings on several web sites and through a number of news <MASK> , as well as being passed from person to person in both the online and offline worlds : <PARA> indeed , the account does not hold water simply on the grounds cited in the passage <MASK> above . imagining that seals were deployed to new orleans in the chaotic days that followed katrina is not exceptionally hard , considering the level of disorder that followed the <MASK> wrought by the hurricane . but the notion that dozens of americans were shot dead on mere suspicion of ( relatively minor ) crimes , on american soil and with the full support of a system of law that otherwise does not allow for such summary punitive actions , challenges credulity to a very large degree . moreover , thirty or so bodies of local residents slain in such a manner never turned up as corroborative <MASK> of such a <MASK> . the circumstance kyle <MASK> would have required the silence and compliance of all witnesses , the families of the dead , all involved law enforcement agencies , and untold others who might have become aware of killings meted out under inarguably public circumstances . had kyle and his fellows truly dispatched such a large number of looters or \u201c residents who were contributing to the chaos \u201d ( who had neither been charged with nor convicted of any crime , much less a capital one ), some other <MASK> of this tale would have emerged . one person disappearing under such circumstances is unusual ; thirty or so is truly unbelievable . <PARA> the second <MASK> involved a similar measure of street justice purportedly meted out by kyle to what many would deem deserving recipients . in that tale , kyle was nearly the victim of a carjacking at a gas <MASK> , but the deadly sniper was quicker than his would - be assailants : he drew and fatally wounded the unnamed men . <PARA> the <MASK> got odder , though , when police responded to the situation ( in <MORE> inappropriate time : while they were mourning the loss of a fellow seal at a bar : <PARA> yet again , the <MASK> eventually developed another intriguing twist when kyle elaborated upon it during a 2012 appearance on fox news channel \u2019 s the o \u2019 reilly factor . during that segment , kyle <MASK> the previously unnamed individual he described was none other than jesse ventura , the former professional wrestler , governor of minnesota , and member of the navy \u2019 s underwater demolition teams during the vietnam war era . <PARA> while the <MASK> about the aftermath of hurricane katrina and the carjacking incident were met with some general disbelief , the mention of ventura \u2019 s name introduced a separate credibility issue for kyle in the form of a lawsuit filed by ventura against kyle after the latter \u2019 s appearance on o \u2019 reilly \u2019 s show . after kyle died in 2013 the suit continued against his <MASK> , and a jury eventually found kyle \u2019 s <MASK> had improperly profited from <MASK> made by the decedent that had no basis in provable fact and awarded ventura $ 1 . 8 million dollars in damages : <PARA> however , it should be noted the jury in the case did not specifically have to determine whether kyle had in fact punched out ventura ( for whatever reason ) in order to find in favor of the plaintiff , and its verdict may not have been unanimous : <PARA> so while chris kyle \u2019 s historical legacy as one of america \u2019 s most lethal snipers in foreign wars may be confirmed and corroborated , his <MASK> about various \u201c take charge \u201d incidents in the u . s . are lacking in substantiation . no record of any shooting deaths matching the description of kyle \u2019 s purported carjacking victims has ever surfaced , nor has anyone produced the supposed security camera video of the incident ( or even <MASK> such a video truly exists ). new orleans authorities did not log some thirty unaccounted - for shooting deaths in the wake of hurricane katrina ; and even if kyle \u2019 s <MASK> proved in any way plausible , the government - sanctioned street execution of american citizens on american soil without due process would have prompted a large - scale civil rights scandal . <PARA> moreover , the single <MASK> of this group that stood a legal test of its veracity failed : kyle \u2019 s <MASK> about jesse ventura were sufficiently non - provable that a jury ( deliberating in a country that , by and large , holds a large measure of respect and pursuant leeway for american servicemen ) saw fit to award damages to ventura totaling seven figures , even with the knowledge that kyle himself hadn \u2019 t lived to see the sanction and the damages would be levied against his widow and other beneficiaries of his <MASK> .",

        "text": "<MASK> : spanky . alfalfa . buckwheat . darla . just a few of the easily recognizable names that were a fond part of the childhoods of generations of kids : beloved characters from the 221 our gang comedy <PARA> shorts that hal roach produced between 1922 and 1944 . roach \u2019 s approach was to make films featuring kids being kids , full of fun and spontaneity , not films full of precocious children acting like adults . with the advent of television , the our gang shorts ( shown under the name the little rascals became standard after - school viewing fare for generation after generation of youngsters . <PARA> the depiction of black characters in these films was generally standard for its time . buckwheat , in particular , spoke and acted in a manner considered stereotypical of blacks , and in time the our gang comedies joined a long list of film works considered \u201c racist \u201d by some for containing such portrayals . when cbs brought the long - running and immensely popular radio program amos \u2018 n \u2019 andy to television in 1951 , the series lasted only two seasons , due in part to pressure from groups ( primarily the naacp ) who objected to its portrayals of blacks . nonetheless , old episodes of amos \u2018 n \u2019 andy continued to run successfully in syndication for many years until another round of protests during the height of the civil rights movement in the 1960s finally prompted cbs to permanently withdraw it from syndication ( and attempt to destroy the negatives ) in 1966 . <PARA> around 1989 , the <MASK> began circulating that entertainer bill cosby had bought up the rights to <PARA> the little rascals episodes for the express purpose of keeping them off of television because of their demeaning portrayal of blacks . this <MASK> has nothing to it , of course : king world productions has owned and licensed the rights to the little rascals for over thirty years . the series has been syndicated to television many times and the video rights to some episodes were licensed to cabin fever entertainment in 1997 , but bill cosby has never owned any part of the rights to the little rascals . <PARA> this <MASK> is similar to another <MASK> that circulated in the mid - 1990s : that ted turner had bought up the rights to the tv show the dukes of hazzard to keep it off of television because of its demeaning portrayal of southerners . ( the series is currently syndicated on tnn .) neither <MASK> seems to have been based on anything more than a <MASK> concocted to explain the long absence of a favorite series from the tv screen , and perhaps a desire to poke a little fun at the \u201c political correctness \u201d movement . the connections are obvious : bill cosby is black , ted turner is from atlanta ; hence their alleged interest in protecting the reputations of the groups these programs supposedly besmirch . in bill cosby \u2019 s case , the connection is a little stronger : cosby was one of prominent names who campaigned to pressure cbs into withdrawing amos \u2018 n \u2019 andy from syndication back in the 1960s .",

( although neither of the latter two <MASK> formally seceded from the united <MASK> nor was controlled by a confederate - aligned government , both were <MORE> in - chief and not the official national flag of nazi - era germany : <PARA> another \u201c myth vs . fact \u201d section <MASK> : <PARA> herein lies the problem with symbols : they have no inherent meanings ; they have only whatever meanings people choose to read into them , and different people can associate very different meanings with the same symbol . the confederate battle flag is now regarded in many different ways \u2014 as a symbol of slavery , as a rallying banner for white supremacists , as a quaint historical artifact , as a memorial to those who fought gallantly and bravely ( even if it was in the service of cause no longer considered virtuous ), as a general emblem of rebellion against authority , as a benign display of regional pride , or even as a fond reminder of two \u201c good ol \u2019 boys \u201d who were \u201c never meanin \u2019 no harm .\u201d <PARA> it is <MASK> that for several decades after the civil war , the confederate battle flag was not widely regarded as a negative symbol . its use was largely limited to historical ceremonies associated with veterans \u2019 events and war memorials ; the flag did not become the symbol most prominently associated with the confederacy until several decades after the civil war ended , and it was not widely perceived as a politically polarizing symbol until it was appropriated by segregationist politicians and groups in the middle of the twentieth century . <PARA> however , the fact remains that the confederate battle flag has long since become the pre - eminent symbol of the confederacy and what it stood for , and across the span of several decades it has been co - opted by segregationist and white supremacist groups such as the dixiecrats , the kkk , and the aryan nation . certainly one can be a racist or a white supremacist without associating himself with \u201c southern pride \u201d or a confederate battle flag , but for better or worse , no one group is any more \u201c authorized \u201d to use the confederate battle flag as their symbol than another . the confederate government and its military forces ceased to exist 150 years ago and therefore have no say or control over the usage of the southern cross . <PARA> the sons of confederate veterans may sincerely object to the confederate battle flag \u2019 s use by neo - nazis , skinheads , and other extremist groups , and perhaps some of the men who fought and died for the confederacy would as well if they were alive today . but just as with the swastika , it \u2019 s likely to be a very , very long time before that symbol can be <MASK> and regarded in anything approaching a neutral manner , and probably not until the social issues underlying the public perception of that symbol have been more thoroughly canvassed .",

        "text": "as american cities erupted in protests against racism and police brutality following the death of george floyd in minneapolis in may 2020 , social media users began spreading posts alleging that some group \u2014 or person \u2014 with nefarious intentions had coordinated a scheme to incite and abet violence during the demonstrations by pre - placing piles of bricks along protest routes . <PARA> the <MASK> could be summarized like this : government officials , law enforcement , billionaires , or protesters themselves had strategically placed caches of cinder blocks in cities nationwide \u2014 including boston , dallas , kansas city , and new york city \u2014 so protesters could quickly grab the bricks and break windows or cause other property damage . among the most popular posts was a video of someone who recorded a pile of bricks purportedly near a dallas courthouse and called the pallets a \u201c setup \u201d while another person <MASK> , \u201c they put them there on purpose , bro .'\u201d <PARA> it is unequivocally <MASK> that protesters in many major u . s . cities used bricks to cause destruction ( or , in some cases , to injure police ) during the protests against police brutality following the death of george floyd \u2014 a 46 - year - old , unarmed black man who died after a white minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes . <PARA> but less is known about where , or from whom , the protesters got the bricks , and if the <MASK> on social media alleging a coordinated scheme on behalf of government , activists , or a powerful figure had any truth . <PARA> what follows is a multi - prong examination into the <MASK> . first , we describe the different groups behind the assertion , and then we investigate this specific theory : that the government , police , or another powerful entity formed a scheme to pre - place the bricks along protest routes so officers could retaliate against people who used them or to incite destruction . lastly , we examine the possibility that the bricks were strategically placed on streets by protesters themselves . <PARA> an array of people <MASK> pallets of bricks appeared in protest hot spots as some nefarious scheme , essentially forming three distinct groups that blamed different entities or people for the alleged conspiracy . <PARA> first , some people said police officers or government authorities pre - placed the stacks of bricks to create what protesters called a \u201c trap \u201d set up by officers to quickly catch anyone who used them and have a reason to use excessive force . many believers of that theory used the hashtag # baitbricks on social media to spread awareness of the alleged government - run scheme and circulated the below - displayed poster as a safety message for protesters : <PARA> they included followers of the qanon movement and accounts that suggested without <MORE> our protest \u201d were part of a construction project , and the department asked the contractor to remove them from the street . <PARA> a similar <MASK> played out in fort myers , florida , where city officials told the local nbc news <MASK> the bricks in question were part of a project to install optic fiber in the area . \u201c the bricks have been here for a long time ,\u201d said a resident , who works in the downtown area . <PARA> meanwhile , in fayetteville , north carolina , someone recorded a video in which viewers can see protesters and what the narrator called \u201c some random - ass bricks \u201d near them . but those stacks , too , had apparently been in the area before demonstrations began and were part of a project to improve the walkway for pedestrians . <PARA> a video that was uploaded to youtube on may 24 ( the day before floyd \u2019 s death ) about the city \u2019 s reopening during the covid - 19 pandemic confirmed this theory ( it shows the bricks ), as well as a 2018 document called \u201c fayetteville comprehensive pedestrian plan \u201d that listed the site as one in need of crosswalk and signal improvements . additionally , bbc misinformation specialists confirmed with the city of fayetteville that construction crews had placed the bricks on the sidewalk recently for restoration work . <PARA> those misunderstandings aside , at least two government - run departments \u2014 the kansas city police and houston public works \u2014 said they had received and investigated reports of \u201c bricks and rocks \u201d during the demonstrations . <PARA> the former agency \u2014 without providing photographic <MASK> or further details \u2014 suggested the \u201c stashes \u201d were purposefully placed \u201c to be used during a riot ,\u201d essentially suggesting an effort by someone or a group to cause property destruction with the cinder blocks . <PARA> furthermore , in reference to the <MASK> that protesters , perhaps those who consider themselves anti - fascists , had pre - placed the bricks , it is important to note that not all activists who resist fascism use weapons or cause property destruction during protests . however , some antifa members believe any violence that does occur during protests is a form of self - defense to combat extreme right - wing ideologies . <PARA> in sum , since no <MASK> suggests there was a coordinated effort on behalf of government entities or billionaires to pre - place bricks on protest routes to incite violence during the 2020 demonstrations against police brutality , and considering the amount and variety of <MASK> that showed many of the reports of suspicious bricks on social media were misunderstandings , we rate this <MASK> \u201c mostly <MASK> \u201d \u2014 with the caveat that it is possible that antifa members or other protesters could have strategically placed bricks in easily accessible spots to facilitate causing property damage .",

        "text": "on feb . 25 , 2020 , during a democratic primary debate in south carolina , u . s . sen . elizabeth warren held a robust back - and - forth exchange with fellow candidate and former new york mayor mike bloomberg . at one point warren told a <MASK> that she has told many times before \u2060\u2014 how her time as a public school instructor came to an end , and how that spurred her on to a career in public service . on that particular occasion , she also segued into an attack on bloomberg , as follows : <PARA> it \u2019 s a <MASK> warren has made on several occasions . in her 2014 book \u201c a fighting chance ,\u201d she wrote : <PARA> \u201c in 1970 , just after i finished college in houston , jim was transferred to ibm \u2019 s office in new jersey . soon after we moved , i got my first real job , as a speech therapist for special needs kids at a nearby public school . i was twenty - one , but i looked about fourteen . by the end of the school year , i was pretty obviously pregnant . the principal did what i think a lot of principals did back then \u2014 wished me good luck , didn \u2019 t ask me back for the next school year , and hired someone else for the job .\u201d <PARA> at a rally in oakland , california , in may 2019 , warren told largely the same <MASK> , in much the same way , <MASK> that the principal , upon seeing that warren was pregnant , \u201c wished me luck , showed me the door , and hired someone else for the job .\u201d <PARA> the board of education in riverdale , new jersey , hired warren as a speech therapy instructor in the fall of 1970 . according to local news reports , warren worked two days per week . <PARA> the following spring , in april 1971 , the board approved a new contract for warren , according to riverdale board of education minutes first published by the right - leaning washington free beacon in october 2019 . the minutes for the april 21 , 1971 , meeting show that the board voted unanimously to approve \u201c issuance of contracts \u201d to several teachers , including warren , for the following school year . <PARA> the next day , apr . 22 , the news of paterson , new jersey , reported that warren was one of 10 non - tenure teachers \u201c hired \u201d and \u201c appointed \u201d by the riverdale board of education , although the <MASK> noted that \u201c the 1971 - 72 contract has not been settled .\u201d <PARA> in telling the <MASK> of how her employment at a new jersey public school district came to an end , warren never mentioned the fact that the board of education <MORE> someone else for the job . and that was it . i lost my job . \u201d <PARA> the executive principal at riverdale at that time was edward pruzinsky , who died in 1999 . as a result , we cannot verify the accuracy of warren \u2019 s description of that conversation , or even whether such a conversation took place . without any documentary <MASK> for a private conversation between warren and pruzinsky , we can \u2019 t corroborate nor dismiss her <MASK> that she lost her job as a result of becoming pregnant . as a result , we are issuing a rating of \u201c unproven \u201d and left to examine the plausibility of her <MASK> , if not its accuracy . <PARA> warren \u2019 s 2019 / 20 account is plausible . broadly speaking , women in the united <MASK> in the early 1970s were indeed subject to employment discrimination \u2014 whether formal or informal , blatant or subtle \u2014 in the event that they became pregnant . the first substantial legal protections against such discrimination came with the 1978 pregnancy discrimination act . <PARA> warren \u2019 s <MASK> also appear plausible in the specific context of riverdale school district . in 2019 cbs news spoke to two former teachers who worked at riverdale at the same time as warren . one of them said , \u201c the rule was at five months you had to leave when you were pregnant . now , if you didn \u2019 t tell anybody you were pregnant and they didn \u2019 t know , you could fudge it and try to stay on a little bit longer . but they kind of wanted you out if you were pregnant .\u201d <PARA> the fact that local newspapers reported that warren had resigned in order to \u201c raise a family ,\u201d and that school board minutes stipulated that board members had voted to \u201c accept with regret \u201d her resignation , do not hold significant weight . a school board official could quite plausibly have informally forced or persuaded warren to resign her post , allowing them to present what was an act of discrimination as a young mother \u2019 s regrettable but voluntary choice . <PARA> however , we cannot rule out the possibility that warren , as she indicated in her 2007 interview , did indeed decide for herself that she did not have the requisite qualifications to continue as a speech therapist for the time being , and that she , with her first child on the way , made a voluntary choice without pressure from school board officials to decline the new contract that was on the table . <PARA> the senator \u2019 s 2019 / 20 account of how her time as a public school instructor came to an end is plausible , but its credibility is undermined by the fact that she did not provide the same explanation when she discussed the issue in 2007 .",

collected data on every danish women born between 1935 and 1978 concluded there was no increased risk of breast cancer from abortions , organizations such as the world health organization , u . s . national cancer institute , american cancer society , and many others now reject the existence of any such link . the conclusions drawn from that study , as published in the new england journal of medicine ( nejm ), were that : <PARA> from a political standpoint , the issue saw a resurgence in attention under the socially conservative administration of george w . bush , which changed the language on an national cancer institute fact sheet regarding breast cancer and abortions against the wishes of that organization \u2019 s scientists . this issue was discussed , later , in an august 2003 us congressional report from the committee on oversight and government reform that investigated changes to science policy under the bush administration : <PARA> the notion that reproductive choices affect breast cancer risk is not new , nor is it controversial . it is widely accepted , for example , that carrying a pregnancy to term reduces one \u2019 s risk of developing breast cancer later in life . this issue is often conflated with the question of abortions increasing a woman \u2019 s risk , because since carrying a pregnancy to term may reduce risk of breast cancer , having an abortion may offset that reduced risk . that is not the question at hand , however : the question , strictly defined , is \u2018 will having an abortion make you more likely to get breast cancer when compared to women who never give birth ?\u2019 <PARA> the scientific basis for the breast cancer - abortion link has its roots , most notably , in a 1980 paper in the american journal of pathology that investigated one potential mechanism proposed for relationships between abortion and breast cancer : that leftover undifferentiated cells in a woman \u2019 s breast ( which occur as part of hormonal changes that help to prepare a woman for breastfeeding and appear during pregnancy , and which would become fully differentiated by the end of a pregnancy ) are more susceptible to cancer <MORE> studies , discussed above , aimed to demonstrate ( successfully ) that case - control studies are a poor design to analyze a purported connection between abortions and breast cancer . <PARA> two of the listed studies included on the list were not , strictly speaking , studies , as they were conference presentations that received little to no peer review ( i . e . laing et al 1994 , bu et al 1995 ). many of the studies on the list ( e . g ., segi et al 1957 , daling et al 1994 , daling et al 1996 ) cautioned that while they may have demonstrated correlations , their data were not sufficient to establish causation or even to represent actual trends . <PARA> four of the studies on the list reached conclusions explicitly counter to the <MASK> that they demonstrate an increased risk of breast in populations of women who have had abortions : <PARA> arguably the most notable publication on this list , both in scope and in citations , is a 1996 paper authored by brind himself ( who created this list in the first place ), a meta - review of 28 studies ( many of which are also featured individually on the list ). his own study concluded : <PARA> typically , meta - reviews have <MASK> inclusion standards delineating what studies are of high enough quality to be analyzed . in brind \u2019 s study , however , \u201c no quality criteria were imposed , but a narrative review of all included studies is presented for the reader \u2019 s use in assessing the quality of individual studies .\u201d numerous scientists have serious issues with it on this basis . a team of harvard epidemiologists used brind \u2019 s methods in their own study , concluding that the causation he so confidently <MASK> the could not be made with the data he used . <PARA> mads melbye , author of the 1997 danish cohort study , took issue with brind \u2019 s study as well , as covered in a <MASK> of the topic : <PARA> our classification of \u201c <MASK> \u201d acknowledges that some scientists and studies suggest a link between abortion and breast cancer , but that suggestion is rooted in the fact that the methodologies utilized in the studies supporting such a link are widely accepted as flawed by the majority of the scientific community and by the fact that large cohort studies , better suited to test this question in the first place , suggest that no link exists . <PARA> observational studies of any kind will always come with limitations and wiggle room for politically motivated players to exploit , as was the case 2002 . as a whole , however , we regard use of these data to make a causal link between breast cancer and abortions , without any discussion of their significant caveats involved , intentionally misleading enough to be disqualifying .",

breaking international \u201c farewell tour \u201d in 2000 , but never strayed far from the public eye , popping up in 2008 for a grammy awards show duet with beyonc\u00e9 and embarking soon thereafter on a highly <MASK> 50th anniversary tour throughout the u . s . and europe . <PARA> turner suffered some serious health setbacks between 2013 and 2018 , but bounced back to help mount a theatrical production based on her life and music ( tina : the tina turner musical , which opened in london in april 2018 ), and pen a best - selling autobiography ( tina turner : my love <MASK> , published in october 2018 ). <PARA> the public was largely unaware of turner \u2019 s health problems until she spoke of them in her memoir , revealing that she suffered a stroke in 2013 from which she was still recovering when she was diagnosed with early - stage intestinal cancer and kidney failure . the cancer was successfully treated by the removal of part of her colon , but by that time her kidney disease had progressed to the point where a transplant was required and she would have to go on dialysis until a kidney donor was found . <PARA> at that point , turner wrote , the future looked so bleak to her that she considered requesting assisted suicide : <PARA> turner \u2019 s current husband , record producer erwin bach , came to the rescue by offering to donate one of his own kidneys . in a further stroke of good fortune , their blood types matched , and a transplant was performed in april 2017 , followed by a long process of recovery . \u201c my body keeps trying to reject the new kidney , which is not uncommon after a transplant ,\u201d turner wrote . \u201c this means i have to take strong doses of immuno - suppressants to weaken my antibodies and prevent them from attacking an organ they don \u2019 t recognize .\u201d even so , she felt that the operation had quite literally given her a new lease on life . <PARA> \u201c after a transplant , it seems that there \u2019 s always another test , another doctor \u2019 s appointment or biopsy to get through ,\u201d turner wrote . \u201c but i \u2019 m still here . we \u2019 re both still here , closer than we ever imagined \u2014 and that \u2019 s cause for celebration .\u201d <PARA> those words were written in 2018 , a year that would <MORE> have really nice doctors .\u201d <PARA> nevertheless , <MASK> began to circulate , and continued to circulate well into 2019 , to the effect that turner was \u201c gravely ill \u201d and \u201c near death \u201d due to any number of alleged ailments . some of the illnesses named in these <MASK> were stroke , stomach cancer , intestinal cancer , and the rejection of a kidney or liver transplant . <PARA> the earliest of them appeared to be a side - effect of the extensive press coverage her book had received . despite the fact that turner \u2019 s stroke had occurred five years earlier ( and no subsequent instances had been reported ), we began receiving inquiries from readers in october 2018 ( the month the autobiography came out ) asking if it was <MASK> that she had just suffered a stroke . similarly , although turner <MASK> in the book that tests showed no recurrence of her cancer after she underwent surgery in 2016 , readers were still asking us in early 2019 if it was <MASK> that she was dying of intestinal or stomach cancer . <PARA> the public was also misled by erroneous reporting from tabloid newspapers and gossip websites . for example , in october 2018 , a number of these sites repeated \u201c unconfirmed reports \u201d that turner was \u201c fighting stomach cancer .\u201d in november , national enquirer , radar online , and other unreliable sources <MASK> that turner was so close to death that she was \u201c planning her own funeral .\u201d ( the same sources played up an alleged rivalry between turner and the late aretha franklin , saying turner wanted her funeral to be bigger than franklin \u2019 s .) <PARA> but three months later , in a february 2019 interview with the sunday post , turner sounded upbeat and optimistic . \u201c i don \u2019 t have any big plans but i don \u2019 t like to rule out any possibilities either ,\u201d she said . \u201c i still love my music and some days i feel like performing again . i \u2019 ll be around for a while yet and who knows what might happen . we \u2019 ll see but in the meantime keep the music in your life . i \u2019 ve gotta say it \u2013 music is simply the best .\u201d <PARA> on 3 march 2019 , tina turner was photographed onstage with the cast of tina : the tina turner musical at the show \u2019 s german premiere in hamburg . please note that she looks neither \u201c gravely ill \u201d nor \u201c near death \u201d in the photo below or in video of the occasion . <PARA> unfortunately , turner \u2019 s management declined to answer questions about the <MASK> of the singer \u2019 s health when we reached out to them for comment , but based on the <MASK> , <MASK> of tina turner \u2019 s imminent demise appear unfounded .",

        "text": "on the morning after the oct . 8 , 2020 , vice presidential debate between republican u . s . vice president mike pence and democratic u . s . sen . kamala harris of california , snopes readers asked us to look into one of the debate \u2019 s flashpoints \u2014 the democratic ticket \u2019 s stance on hydraulic fracturing , commonly known as fracking , a controversial method of accessing fossil fuel deposits , typically natural gas . <PARA> in particular , readers asked snopes whether democratic presidential candidate joe biden was proposing a ban on fracking . at one point in the oct . 8 debate , which took place at the university of utah in salt lake city , pence told harris : <PARA> \u201c i know joe biden says otherwise now , as you do , but the both of you repeatedly committed to abolishing fossil fuel and banning of fracking .\u201d <PARA> a week earlier , the reelection campaign of u . s . president donald trump published an ad that <MASK> biden \u201c will end fracking \u201d and contained a brief clip of biden saying \u201c no more \u2014 no new fracking .\u201d <PARA> on oct . 7 , shortly before the vice presidential debate , trump himself tweeted that \u201c joe biden and kamala harris both want to ban fracking .\u201d <PARA> this fact check will focus on the <MASK> that biden \u2019 s policy on fracking was to ban it , because that \u2019 s the specific question raised by snopes readers in the hours after pence and harris \u2019 debate . however , it \u2019 s worth briefly addressing the other components of the blanket <MASK> made by both pence in the oct . 8 debate and trump in his oct . 7 tweet , and that analysis is available later in this <MASK> . <PARA> the official biden - harris clean energy policy proposes \u201c banning new oil and gas permitting on public lands and waters .\u201d it does not propose an outright ban on fracking . in recent years , federal lands have accounted for around 10 % of u . s . oil and gas production , so biden \u2019 s policy would allow the vast majority of fracking to continue , especially at first , since it would only stop new leases . <PARA> as the washington post has reported , biden has repeatedly emphasized on the campaign trail that he would not ban fracking , but would instead seek to end new leases on federal lands . on one occasion , during a primary debate in march 2020 , biden caused confusion about his policy on fracking . he had the following exchange with u . s . sen . bernie sanders of vermont : <PARA> later in the debate , sanders pointed to the absence of a complete ban on fracking from biden \u2019 s platform , saying : \u201c you cannot continue , <MORE> on federal lands , but does not call for an outright ban on fracking . <PARA> during the oct . 8 vice presidential debate , pence said : <PARA> \u201c i know joe biden says otherwise now , as you do , but the both of you repeatedly committed to abolishing fossil fuel and [ the ] banning of fracking .\u201d <PARA> the official biden - harris platform proposes to end fossil fuel subsidies , and to encourage a worldwide ban on fossil fuel subsidies . during a campaign event in somersworth , new hampshire , in february 2020 , biden told hecklers ( 9 : 45 ), \u201c we are going to get rid of fossil fuels ,\u201d but then he added , \u201c we \u2019 re going to phase out fossil fuels .\u201d <PARA> at a town hall event in new castle , new hampshire , in september 2019 , biden told an audience member ( 25 : 17 ), \u201c i guarantee you we \u2019 re going to end fossil fuel .\u201d this prompted an attack by pence during the october 2020 debate . the vice president said : \u201c joe biden looked a supporter in the eye and pointed and said , \u2018 i guarantee , i guarantee that we will abolish fossil fuels .'\u201d <PARA> however , what pence failed to mention was what biden said next : \u201c before 2050 , god willing . no , it can \u2019 t be done by 2030 . no . there is not one single person that \u2019 s argued it can be done by then . but it can be done by 2050 , it may be 2045 .\u201d <PARA> during the primaries , harris \u2019 platform called for \u201c replacing dirty fossil fuels with clean renewable energy ,\u201d proposed to \u201c phase out all fossil fuel development on public lands \u201d and <MASK> : \u201c we must begin intentionally and deliberately transitioning away from fossil fuels , shifting from being an exporter of fossil fuels to an exporter of clean energy technology .\u201d <PARA> there \u2019 s no doubt that both biden and harris , like many others , are proposing a broad , long - term transition away from fossil fuels to what is known as \u201c clean energy .\u201d in their platforms , both have emphasized new employment opportunities and protections for workers whose jobs and livelihoods are affected by that transition , which they say will take decades . as we \u2019 ve shown , biden has explicitly <MASK> that the phasing out of fossil fuels cannot be completed until 2045 at the earliest \u2014 a 25 - year transition . <PARA> the trump - pence rhetorical strategy has been to <MASK> present that movement as a sudden halt or overnight legal prohibition on fossil fuel production that would prove catastrophic to employment prospects in the united <MASK> . in reality , the biden - harris platform is much more nuanced .",

        "text": "the \u201c one ring \u201d telephone scam is similar in form to the venerable 809 area code scam in that both involve trying to dupe unwary phone customers into calling a foreign phone number in order to stick them with hefty charges . while the 809 scam involved sending pages , faxes , voicemails , or e - mail messages that supposedly relayed important information ( e . g ., news about a distressed family member or a notification of prize winnings ) in order to lure the recipient into calling a provided phone number , the \u201c one ring \u201d scam employs a simpler technique \u2014 the scammers place calls to blocks of phone numbers ( sometimes with the use of robo - call devices ), disconnect each call after a single ring , and hope that the owners of some of those numbers will be curious enough to call back : <PARA> once hooked , the victims of the \u201c one ring \u201d scam are supposedly separated from their money through a variety of means : keeping them on the line for as long as possible while they rack up international call tolls , duping them into unknowingly calling premium - rate phone numbers ( akin to the 900 pay - per - call services ), or enticing them into signing up for pricey services , as described in a may 2019 alert issued by the federal communications commission ( fcc ): <PARA> as with the 809 scam , however , it appears that the prevalence of the one - ring scam and the potential damages its victims might suffer are considerably lower than exaggerated warnings about it often suggest : <PARA> it \u2019 s certainly not <MASK> , as <MASK> in the example cited above , that the mere act of calling a particular number would allow a phone user \u2019 s contacts and banking information to be stolen by someone else . that sort of information would be compromised only if another party somehow hacked into the user \u2019 s phone ( via a malicious app or other code ) and / or the user actively did something to enable access to it . ( in either case , there \u2019 s no obvious reason why such a scheme would require the victim to place a call to the information - stealer rather than the other way around .) <PARA> some versions of this warning maintain that \u201c you may also be charged a monthly fee for joining some club you know nothing about . by calling the number , you \u2018 authorize \u2019 them to place a fee on your cellphone bill .\u201d however , it seems to be more the case that victims aren \u2019 t subscribed to services simply through the act of calling a phone number , but rather that the scammers use social engineering techniques ( including harassment ) to persuade them to subscribe to pay services or give out their credit card information : <PARA> other versions of the warning caution that cell phone owners who return one - ring calls are charged $ 19 . 95 for an \u201c international call fee \u201d and then a \u201c$ 9 . 00 per minute charge \u201d on top of that . but verizon currently lists rates for placing calls to the 222 country code mentioned in the above fcc alert ( mauritania ) at about $ 3 . 00 per minute , so a victim who returned such a call and stayed on the line for a couple of minutes before hanging up might realistically be out $ 6 or so in toll charges . phone customers can generally get any \u201c premium service \u201d ( i . e ., \u201c international call fee \u201d) charges tacked on to such a call reversed by contacting their phone service providers and documenting the circumstances of the call . <PARA> many forms of this warning list specific country / area codes that phone users should never place calls to ( because of their association with various phone scams ), including 473 ( grenada ), 268 ( antigua ), 876 ( jamaica ), 809 ( the dominican republic ), 375 ( belarus ), 371 ( latvia ), 222 ( mauritania ), and 284 ( the british virgin islands ). there is , of course , nothing wrong with connecting to numbers with these country / area codes if you happen to know whom you \u2019 re calling : all cautions regarding the one - ring scam ( and similar schemes ) apply only to solicitations to contact entities unknown to you . if you have to call a number associated with a dialing code that \u2019 s unfamiliar to you , you can use a code lookup site to check it out first .",

        "text": "<MASK> : the last few years have seen several television programs dedicated to the examination and \u201c debunking \u201d of urban legends and similar types of stories . one entry in this genre was a show entitled mostly <MASK> stories : urban legends revealed , which aired on cable <MASK> <PARA> the learning channel ( tlc ) in the u . s . <PARA> one of the features of this program was its use of quizzes as bridges across commercial breaks \u2014 just before each commercial break it presented the audience with an urban legend - related tidbit and challenged viewers to guess whether it was <MASK> or not ; after the commercial break the ( supposedly ) correct answer was revealed . we noted with some amusement that most of these quizzes dealt with fairly obscure items covered on our web site ; we were even more amused when the 18 march 2003 episode posed the question of whether the nursery rhyme \u201c sing a song of sixpence \u201d was used as a coded message for recruiting pirates . of course , that was nothing compared to the hilarity which ensued in our house when \u201c mostly <MASK> stories \u201d revealed this item to be <MASK> : \u201c the notorious pirate blackbeard used this code to recruit hands , whom he paid sixpence a day ,\u201d they disclosed . <PARA> what \u2019 s so funny ? the notion that the nursery rhyme \u201c sing a song of sixpence \u201d was used as a recuiting song for pirates was invented by us as an example of a <MASK> so incredibly silly that no one could possibly believe it to be <MASK> . we created the <PARA> lost legends section of our web site as a humorous repository for completely absurd \u201c <MASK> \u201d stories based on premises too ridiculous to be believable as our way of demonstrating the potential pitfalls of taking any one source \u2019 s unvarnished word for anything , and for one of the entries in this section we came up with a wild tale about the nursery rhyme \u201c sing a song of sixpence \u201d having <MASK> as a coded message used to recruit crew members for pirate ships , complete with a line - by - line explication of how it was sung in taverns by confederates of the notorious pirate blackbeard to assemble crews for his prize - hunting expeditions . the whole idea was supposed to be far too outrageous to be taken seriously ( picture in your mind \u2019 s eye grim - faced pirates intent upon supplementing their crews roaming from pub to pub , belting out a children \u2019 s rhyme ), and in case any readers somehow missed the obvious humor , the page ( like all entries in the lost legends section ) included a link to supplemental page explaining that it was all just a gag perpetrated for the purpose of teaching folks not to ignore their common sense even in the face of a presumed authority . <PARA> that a television program devoted to testing the veracity of urban legends could take this bit of nonsense at face value is an irony we never contemplated . <PARA> we have to agree with the conclusion of the courier mail journalist who noted ( albeit for the wrong reason ) that : <PARA> in the modern world , people are confronted with a barrage of information . trying to come to grips with such a sensory assault can be a problem . information is one thing , but processing info until it is useful can be quite another . hence the common distinction between information and trivia . trivia can be interesting but is generally not particularly useful . knowing that the rhyme \u2018 sing a song of sixpence \u2019 was <MASK> used to recruit pirates for blackbeard \u2019 s ship is not often going to help anyone perform their job better , write a better assignment or make a breakthrough contribution to society . <PARA> subsequent airings of the tlc episode featured a revised version of this \u201c fact \u201d:",

year - old , jack andraka gained fame for prototyping a potential test for pancreatic cancer that was purportedly quicker and cheaper than existing methods , for which he was awarded the grand prize at the 2012 intel international science and engineering fair . in 2014 , then - forbes healthcare reporter ( and current medical reporter at <MASK> ) matthew herper described the concept this way : <PARA> herper , in his capacity as the author of that year \u2019 s forbes 30 under 30 list of promising young scientists , had reviewed a draft of a paper andraka had written about his test along with six other expert reviewers . in a piece titled \u201c why biotech whiz kid jack andraka is not on the forbes 30 under 30 list ,\u201d he relayed the concerns of five anonymous reviewers and one non -

linked immunosorbent assay ) tests . specifically , elisa tests that identify the presence <MORE> hours to run . suggesting it takes 14 hours inflates significantly the speed comparison in favor of andraka \u2019 s test . <PARA> church also <MASK> that the cost comparison employed by andraka was flawed because it compared only the manufacturing costs on his invention \u2019 s side but included profit and overhead on the elisa test side : <PARA> as for sensitivity , church argued that the results presented by andraka varied too much to say anything about sensitivity ( a measure that gets at potential <MASK> positives ). <PARA> andraka was able to spend six months in the lab of a johns hopkins medical center researcher where he tested his test using blood from mice who had pancreatic cancer compared to those who didn \u2019 t . such tests , even if they produced promising results , would not be the same as demonstrating efficacy as a diagnostic tool for pancreatic cancer in humans . <PARA> outside of accuracy \u2014 i . e ., the ability to correctly identify humans with pancreatic cancer \u2014 the early detection of the disease was also central to the project , something andraka would not have been able to test directly for his work at hopkins . ira pastan , the national cancer institutes researcher who discovered mesothelin , the biomarker used in andraka \u2019 s test , told the sydney morning herald that the protein is not actually elevated in the blood in early pancreatic cancer patients and thus could not be indicative of the early stages of the disease . other scientific studies support pastan \u2019 s objection . <PARA> a 2013 study into the diagnostic efficacy of mesothelin on pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma ( a form of pancreatic cancer ) concluded that the biomarker was \u201c a weak diagnostic classifier on its own \u201d but may be of use as part of a larger panel test . mesothelin is also present in cases of other cancers as well , including \u201c malignant mesothelioma and ... ovarian , and lung adenocarcinomas . in a 2015 <MASK> provided to sydney morning herald reporter nick bryant by john hopkins university , the institution made clear the results were far too preliminary to declare such accuracy or to speculate on its future success : <PARA> andraka does not hold an international patent on his device . although he applied for one in 2012 , that application was ultimately denied based on lacking an \u201c inventive step .\u201d <PARA> all told , media outlets like the epoch times continue to run with an out - of - date and highly clickable fairytale that has not been accurate since at least 2014 . andraka himself acknowledges the shortcomings of his earlier scientific pronouncements and is thankful for the criticism he has received , telling ( for example ) the sydney morning herald in 2015 that \u201c i really appreciate their concerns because their concerns made my project better . it was definitely a learning curve .\u201d",

        "text": "when restaurant workers place a lemon wedge on your glass of water , tea , or soda , they are apparently spiking your drink with germs . <PARA> a new study by a new jersey microbiologist found nasty bacteria on two - thirds of the lemons that were tested from 21 restaurants . <PARA> \u201c it was gross ,\u201d said anne lagrange loving , assistant science professor at passaic county community college .\u201d <PARA> loving decided to do the study after noticing a waitress with dirty fingernails delivering a drink to a table . <PARA> \u201c they put lemon in my diet coke , i didn \u2019 t ask for it , and so i decided to do a study .\u201d <PARA> loving and her team swabbed for bacteria as soon as drinks hit the table at restaurants all around paterson , new jersey . <PARA> \u201c you would think they had dipped the lemons in raw meat ,\u201d she said , referring to the high levels of bacteria that she found . <PARA> the swabs of lemon wedges revealed everything from high counts of fecal bacteria to a couple of dozen other microorganisms \u2014 most of which can make you sick . they found bacteria on the rind and on the flesh of the lemons . <PARA> health laws require lemons to be handled with gloves or tongs . but its common practice for waiters and waitresses to simply pop the little lemon wedge onto a drinking glass with their bare hands . <PARA> if an employee \u2019 s hands aren \u2019 t clean , however , then touching the lemons is likely to contaminate them with bacteria according to loving . <PARA> this is not the first time that anne loving has gone looking for bacteria in unusual places . she did a study several years ago and found bacteria on communion cups . <PARA> \u201c you \u2019 d just have to know me ,\u201d she laughed . \u201c i \u2019 m a germ freak .\u201d <PARA> but , loving says , the results of the study point to a significant problem . <PARA> \u201c people need to know that the lemons have bacteria on them that can make them sick .\u201d <PARA> <MASK> : the <MASK> cited above references a study ( published in <PARA> the journal of environmental health in december 2007 and co - authored by anne lagrange loving , an assistant professor of science at passaic county community college ) in which a total of 76 lemon wedges served with water or soda were sampled from 21 different restaurants and analyzed for microbial growth . the study found that 69 . 7 % of the lemon wedges sampled produced some form of microbial growth from the rind and / or the flesh , encompassing a total of 25 different microorganisms including bacteria and yeasts . the study noted that \u201c the microbes found on the lemon samples in our investigation all have the potential to cause infectious diseases at various body sites .\u201d <PARA> however , this study in itself doesn \u2019 t demonstrate that restaurant patrons are at high risk for contracting some serious illnesses due to food workers \u2019 not observing sufficiently rigorous sanitary standards . for one thing , the study did not determine the <MASK> of the microbial contaminants : <PARA> it is not possible to definitively identify the <MASK> of the microorganisms . while the enterobacteriaceae and nonfermentative gramnegative bacilli could have come from the fingertips of a restaurant employee via human fecal or raw - meat or poultry contamination , they might have contaminated the lemons before they even arrived at the restaurant . the gram - positive cocci and corynebacterium isolates may have been introduced onto the lemons from the skin or oral flora of anyone who handled them , before or after they arrived in the restaurant . the bacillus species are ubiquitous and could have had numerous sources , including airborne spores landing on the fruit or on the knife used to cut the lemon . <PARA> the study also did not determine the likelihood of customers \u2019 contracting infectious diseases from restaurant - served lemon wedges , nor did it cite any examples of such an occurrence : <PARA> [ t ] he likelihood [ of the microbes \u2019 causing infectious diseases ] was not determined in this study . an extensive search of the literature yielded no reported outbreaks or illnesses attributed to lemon slices in beverages . establishment of an infection would depend upon the number of microbes introduced ; this investigation did not include a quantitative determination of the numbers of microorganisms on the lemons . other factors that would contribute to the establishment of an infection would include whether the organisms were resistant to multiple antibiotics , the general health and age of the individual , the <MASK> of the immune system , and the integrity of the mucous membranes of the lips and mouth . <PARA> what the study uncovered , basically , is a potential problem that requires more study : <PARA> although lemons have known antimicrobial properties , the results of our study indicate that a wide variety of microorganisms may survive on the flesh and the rind of a sliced lemon . restaurant patrons should be aware that lemon slices added to beverages may include potentially pathogenic microbes . further investigations could determine the source of these microorganisms , establish the actual threat ( if any ) posed by their presence on the rim of a beverage , and develop possible means for preventing the contamination of the lemons . it could also be worthwhile to study contamination on other beverage garnishes , such as olives , limes , celery , and cherries , and to investigate whether alcoholic beverages have an effect not seen with water and soda .",

( a short - sale is a sale where the banks accepts less money than is owed on the home ). after some chit - chat , she proceeded to tell us that she and her sister ( who also lived in the area ) were buying each other \u2019 s homes via the short - sale process . i mentioned to her that i thought relatives could not be involved in those transactions . she smiled and said \u201c we have two different last names so no one knows the difference \u201d. <PARA> she went on to tell us that each of them owed over 100k on their homes and were in the process of buying each other \u2019 s homes for about 10 - 15k cash . to top it off , they were each receiving $ 3 , 000 . 00 in government provided relocation assistance at the closing . <PARA> my buyers and i were amazed that she was outright admitting to fraud and yet , she continued . she began to tell us that the best part of her scheme was that because they currently were not working that they ( both ) are now receiving section 8 vouchers . i said i thought those were for renters and she said \u201c that \u2019 s the best part ; me and my sister are going to be renting each other \u2019 s homes so we don \u2019 t even have to move , and obama is going to give us each $ 800 . 00 a month to pay the rent !\u201d she then picked up a picture she had framed of obama and did a little happy dance around her living room and while she kissed the picture she was singing \u201c thank you obama .... thank you obama .\u201d <PARA> so here is the bottom line ... both of these scammers got at least $ 80 , 000 . 00 in debt forgiven , $ 3 , 000 . 00 in cash for relocation ( when in fact they did not relocate ) and to boot , you and i will now be paying ( through our taxes ) $ 1 , 600 . 00 in rent for each them each and every month .... perhaps forever ! <PARA> and i also would not be at all surprised if they are receiving food stamps and whatever other programs are available for <MORE> on a property that he <MASK> bought for $ 900 , 000 but that is now valued at only $ 300 , 000 , his property is described as being under water . the second refers to a process which has been used by some borrowers to keep afloat financially by shedding their under water properties . <PARA> when a property owner holds an under water mortgage and can no longer make his mortgage payments , one remedy is for the lienholder to agree to a short sale : that is , to allow the owner to sell the property for less than the amount still owed on the loan . a short sale leaves the lender taking a loss , but it is often preferable to the alternative of the lender \u2019 s having to foreclose on the property and resell it <PARA> themselves ( with no guarantee the resale would bring in any more money than the short sale did ). <PARA> the unpaid balance still owed to a lienholder by the property owner after a short sale is known as a \u201c deficiency .\u201d if the owner with the aforementioned $ 600 , 000 mortgage short sells his home for $ 250 , 000 , he has incurred a $ 350 , 000 deficiency . a short sale may or may not relieve the borrower of the obligation to repay that deficiency : whether it does depends on the agreement made between the lienholder and the property owner prior to the short sale . ( the amount of a deficiency is considered by the irs to be a benefit which is taxable as income , but the mortgage forgiveness debt relief act of 2007 currently allows taxpayers to exclude income from a discharge of debt on their principal residence .) <PARA> the january 2013 item reproduced above purportedly tells of two women who are supposedly gaming the system by agreeing to buy each other \u2019 s homes at short sales ( in contravention of the rules ), then collect a monthly housing assistance stipend for being renters in the homes they formerly owned . the item contains no verifiable details such as names , dates , or addresses ( only the mention of a city or <MASK> which changes from version to version ), but the scenario described would require a number of implausibilities to all be <MASK> : <PARA> also , little of what is referenced here has any direct connection to president obama . although the hafa program which provides $ 3 , 000 in relocation assistance was introduced by the treasury department under the obama administration in 2009 , the mortgage forgiveness debt relief act ( which exempts deficiencies in short sales from being considered taxable income ) was passed in 2007 during the administration of george w . bush , and section 8 housing assistance was established under the housing act of 1937 passed during the administration of franklin d . roosevelt .",

        "text": "a video purportedly showing 81 - year - old arthur hickenlooper completing an athletic obstacle course went viral in september 2017 , after it was posted to the facebook page for the television game show american ninja warrior : <PARA> because of the apparent youthful vigor exhibited by the contestant , viewers were skeptical the video was on the level . the most common theory about \u201c arthur hickenlooper \u201d was that he was actually a younger athlete disguised as an older man : <PARA> a few aspects of the video also made us skeptical . for example , around the 20 - second mark , the video shows a woman who is supposedly arthur \u2019 s wife , ruth hickenlooper . however , this woman also appears to be the mother of american ninja warrior host matt iseman : <PARA> coincidentally , joan iseman also \u201c competed \u201d during the daytona episode of american ninja warrior , although that competition looked to be something of a farce : <PARA> deceptive edits were likely used at the end of the video to make it appear as if iseman \u2019 s mother had completed the course . changes in sleeve position and nail polish color , however , indicate that a different person actually completed the course before iseman was edited in at the end of the video . the following comparison shows the actual athlete with a light green nail polish and rolled up sleeves ( left ) and a picture of iseman \u2019 s mother with long sleeves and dark nail polish ( right ) on the victory stage : <PARA> if the video of arthur hickenlooper were real , surely host iseman would have mentioned that arthur \u2019 s wife , ruth hickenlooper , was also his mother , joan iseman . <PARA> the viral video also included two suspicious photographs purportedly showing \u201c hickenlooper \u201d: <PARA> we have not been able to find the sources for either of these photographs , but we were skeptical that they truly showed an 81 - year - old athlete . although the subject \u2019 s face seemingly belongs to an 81 - year - old man , the rest of his body did not bear any of the wrinkles you \u2019 d expect to see an octogenarian . <PARA> the announcers in the video also called arthur hickenlooper a \u201c bit of a local legend \u201d who still competed in ( and won ) athletic competitions in denver . however , we found no record of an 81 - year - old arthur hickenlooper competing in colorado ( or anywhere else ). arthur \u2019 s name may have been a nod to colorado governor john hickenlooper . <PARA> if arthur hickenlooper wasn \u2019 t a real 81 - year - old , then who wore the \u201c old man \u201d mask for this episode ? our best guess was brent steffensen , an american ninja warrior competitor who posted the video on all of his social media accounts , and who bore a distinct resemblance to \u201c hickenlooper \u201d: <PARA> indeed , steffensen confirmed in an email that he did , in fact , compete on american ninja warrior as the 81 - year - old arthur hickenlooper : \u201c well , now that the cat is out of the bag i can officially say that yes , arthur hickenlooper was actually played by yours truly , lol . gotta say that it was a ton of fun !!\u201d <PARA> the idea of dressing up a younger athlete in an \u201c old man \u201d costume is not new . thrillist published a video in july 2016 which purportedly showed an elderly weight lifting at muscle beach in santa monica . that video included footage of the prosthetics that were applied to kenneth leverich , a former junior olympic weightlifter , to make him appear as if he were an old man . we suspect a similar process was used to create \u201c arthur hickenlooper \u201d for american ninja warrior :",

        "text": "\u201c i had a miscarriage on palm sunday last year . we think he was a boy and named him david raphael . my only prayer when the doctor told me at 11 weeks that my baby had died a month earlier ( at 7 weeks <MASK> ), was that i would have something to bury . the doctor said he would either be too small to find or that his fragile body would be crushed in the miscarriage process and there wouldn \u2019 t be anything left . on palm sunday afternoon he came out . the entire sac was in tact and there he was still floating in the amniotic water . i took a picture so i wouldn \u2019 t forget that moment and how god answered my prayer . i think it would be an amazing photo to show people contemplating abortion . even though he was only 7 weeks when he died , you can see his little arms and legs forming . my 4 year old was looking through my phone when i wasn \u2019 t looking one day and found the picture . he came up to me with it and asked me whose baby it was . even a child can tell that at 7 weeks , the fetus is a little person .\u201d <PARA> <MASK> : on 27 february 2015 , the facebook page \u201c abby johnson : prowoman , prochild , prolife \u201d posted the above - <MASK> <MASK> along with a <PARA> photograph that purportedly depicts a fetus miscarried at the 11 - week mark . according to the post , the pictured fetus ceased to develop past the seven - week mark , but its expulsion was delayed for an additional four weeks . <PARA> one aspect of the <MASK> that should be noted is that it was <MASK> made anonymously and then picked up and shared on the referenced facebook page , so neither the photograph nor the accompanying description constituted a first - person account . <PARA> the <MASK> itself is not unbelievably extraordinary . while miscarriage ( defined as a pregnancy that ends before the 20 - week mark ) is often a private tragedy whose mechanics are little understood by those who haven \u2019 t experienced it , passing an intact <MASK> sac is neither rare nor remarkable . first person tales of such experiences abound , particularly on the internet where they can be shared in relative anonymity among others who have also endured them . anecdotal online accounts of similar experiences are legion : <PARA> if your body is threatening to have a miscarriage now , i am letting you know this so that you will know what you want to do if this happens to you . if you pass the <MASK> sac you do not need to feel morbid , guilty or strange to want to open it and see your baby . these are completely normal and natural feelings <MORE> is growing rapidly and this results in the the head growing faster than the rest of the body . <PARA> the embryo has a large forehead , and the eyes and ears continue to develop . the inner ear starts to develop , but the outer ear on the side of the head won \u2019 t appear for a couple more weeks . <PARA> the limb buds start to form cartilage , which will develop into the bones of the legs and arms . the arm buds get longer and the ends flatten out \u2014 these will become the hands . <PARA> the embryo has a large forehead , and the eyes and ears continue to develop . the inner ear starts to develop , but the outer ear on the side of the head won \u2019 t appear for a couple more weeks . <PARA> the limb buds start to form cartilage , which will develop into the bones of the legs and arms . the arm buds get longer and the ends flatten out \u2014 these will become the hands . <PARA> so while the <MASK> listed above cannot be solidly verified , it does not describe an experience out of line with some early miscarriages : <PARA> many early miscarriages simply look like heavy menstrual periods , sometimes with tiny blood clots in the discharge . if the miscarriage happened with development beyond four or five weeks <MASK> age , it is possible that there may be a small , transparent <MASK> sac with the rudimentary beginnings of a placenta on its edge . if your miscarriage happened beyond six weeks , you may pass an identifiable embryo or fetus in the early stages of development , which may be as small as a pea or larger than an orange depending on how far along you were when the baby stopped growing . ( remember that it is a good idea to see a doctor if you are miscarrying , especially if you are in the later part of the first trimester or beyond ). sometimes even in a later first - trimester miscarriage there may not be recognizable tissue , as sometimes the baby stops growing and begins to deteriorate before the onset of the miscarriage bleeding . <PARA> the assertion that fetal tissue is normally \u201c crushed \u201d by the expulsion process is inaccurate : rather , early miscarriages generally do not produce a quantity of tissue sufficient to identify as a fetus : <PARA> if you miscarry naturally or with medication , you will probably complete the miscarriage at home . the process may be over quickly or may take several days . if you are less than eight weeks pregnant when the miscarriage occurs , the expelled tissue will look no different from heavy menstrual bleeding . the further along you are in pregnancy , the heavier the bleeding and more severe the cramps . you may see the fetus and placenta .",

        "text": "a phone network outage coinciding with the coronavirus pandemic in the summer of 2020 became fertile ground for <MASK> in mid - june , when some cellphone users in the u . s . <MASK> they couldn \u2019 t send or receive calls and text messages . soon after , facebook posts <MASK> that the network outage enabled a suspiciously timed \u201c covid - 19 tracker \u201d to be added to apple and android phones . <PARA> snopes readers sent us numerous posts with variations on the above <MASK> , but the reality was far less dramatic . we learned that the june network outage primarily occurred with t - mobile customers , and the covid - 19 exposure notifications technology in iphones and androids had been rolled out much earlier . also , that tracker technology cannot be activated unless users choose to turn it on . <PARA> here \u2019 s what we know : on june 15 , 2020 , t - mobile and its subsidiary sprint , along with some verizon and at & t users , reported service outages . at & t and verizon reported their networks were operating normally \u2014 verizon , for instance , said the problems stemmed from \u201c another carrier \u2019 s \u201d network issues , which meant that their users \u2019 calls to and from t - mobile accounts were failing . meanwhile , t - mobile announced a circuit failure on its end was the root cause for the outage . <PARA> the <MASK> in the meme displayed below began circulating a few days later connecting the outage to the covid tracking : <PARA> but the new tracker feature already appeared to be available , though not entirely functional , in cellphones , weeks before the outage . an android user , for instance , shared a screenshot of what appeared to be an added feature in google settings on may 12 , presumably an early version of these so - called \u201c trackers \u201d: <PARA> a verified google employee responded to the query on the same forum : <PARA> the exposure notifications is an application programming interface ( api ), not a phone application , that offers app developers a number of standardized operations they can use . developers working for public health agencies around the world issue applications using this api created by apple and google . the google employee emphasized that if the user opted not to download any application that used that notification , then the notification would not be turned on and would not be able to collect any data . <PARA> if android users click on the covid - 19 notifications feature , which is available through google settings , they have to both install a participating app from their region to activate the exposure notifications and enable bluetooth to use the feature . <PARA> on may 20 , google and apple announced the official rollout of the exposure notification api , which uses bluetooth technology to help governments reduce the spread of covid - 19 . apple and google barred authorities from using their technology to collect gps data or require users to enter personal data . the companies are relying on encrypted bluetooth metadata to identify person - to - person transmission of the disease . snopes covered how bluetooth technology traced covid - 19 transmissions here . <PARA> we reached out to both apple and google about the <MASK> . <PARA> a representative for apple did not address our question about the alleged link between the outage and tracker but instead provided a general <MASK> regarding privacy . in that <MASK> , the rep confirmed to snopes that users must explicitly choose to turn on the exposure notifications system for it to work , and it does not collect or use their device location . identities are also protected from google , apple , and other users . users can choose to report a positive covid - 19 diagnosis , and any data collected is only for covid - 19 response efforts . details about how google and apple say they will protect privacy can be found here and here . <PARA> a google representative , however , did confirm \u201c no connection \u201d exists between the june 15 mobile phone network outage and the exposure notifications roll - out . <PARA> we should note that privacy advocates from the electronic frontier foundation ( eff ) are wary of google and apple \u2019 s approach to tracking covid - 19 transmission , and have highlighted a number of security risks , while acknowledging that \u201c bluetooth proximity is the most promising approach so far to automated covid tracking .\u201d <PARA> in sum , because only one major telecommunications network faced widespread disruptions in june , while the exposure notifications application was rolled out in may , the timing makes the overarching <MASK> that the rollout and the outage are related impossible . in addition , cellphone users must themselves download an app , meaning it can \u2019 t be sneakily added on phones . that said , although google and apple have said they have put many privacy safeguards in place , critics still question whether those safeguards are adequate . given all of the above , we rate this <MASK> as \u201c mostly <MASK> .\u201d",

mail back in 2004 did . that viral missive <MASK> that starbucks had not only refused a request for free product from some u . s . marines serving in iraq , but had retorted that \u201c they don \u2019 t support the war [ in iraq ] and anyone in it \u201d: <PARA> a september 2008 version changed \u201c marines \u201d to \u201c royal marines ,\u201d thereby altering the group of soldiers being slighted from american to british . we first encountered the starbucks <MASK> in late april 2004 when it turned up in our inbox . <PARA> we got in touch with the e - mail \u2019 s writer and asked him about the events that led to his penning the note about starbucks \u2019 response to marines who had come to them looking for a donation of coffee . sgt . wright heard the <MASK> from a friend , who had gotten it from someone else . he talked things over with the marine who had supposedly contacted starbucks , and that , coupled with that night \u2019 s televised news about the goings on in iraq , made his blood boil . he pounded out his thoughts into the form of an e - mail , which he mailed to ten of his friends . <PARA> it is that e - mail which continues to circulate to this day . sgt . wright has since learned that what he heard was in error , and he has subsequently tried to set things right by issuing the following retraction : <PARA> sgt . wright has been unable to produce the reply his buddy supposedly received from starbucks , and the folks at starbucks deny engaging in any correspondence on such matter prior to this <MASK> coming along . given that no copy of the letter appears to exist , neither one resting in the hands of the sergeant \u2019 s comrade , nor one residing in starbucks \u2019 files , the <MASK> about the java vendor \u2019 s harsh response to a coffee - hunting marine should be dismissed . <PARA> as for what starbucks has to say about the matter , they have long since refuted the <MASK> on their website , <MASK> : <PARA> although starbucks does not themselves directly donate to military personnel , they do get their coffee into the hands of those serving in the u . s . armed forces through their partnership with the uso . <PARA> under the terms of the starbucks \u2019 corporate giving policy , had such a request as presented in the much - circulated e - mail been <MORE> the military or military families , and related organizations . <PARA> the <MASK> that starbucks would ever have said \u201c they don \u2019 t support the war and anyone in it \u201d is <MASK> , in light of what various news accounts show us about the coffee retailer \u2019 s attitude towards those who serve in the armed forces . in addition to what starbucks themselves say of their beneficences to soldiers , we know from different newspaper <MASK> of other instances of glad - hearted support . in july 2004 , a starbucks in cincinnati was reported to have been practically overflowing with people making yellow ribbons in support of keith \u201c matt \u201d maupin , a soldier whose fate was then uncertain ( it has subsequently been reported that his remains have been found and positively identified ), along with red , white , and blue ones to show support for american troops in iraq . in june 2004 in cleveland , when the mother of one serviceman called her local starbucks to arrange for the shipping of some java to her son , the employees at that store insisted on paying for 30 pounds of coffee as their gift . <PARA> as to another of the <MASK> made in the e - mail , while it is <MASK> someone working at a new york city starbucks did indeed charge ambulance workers $ 130 for three cases of water on september 11 , 2001 , it would not be quite fair to say starbucks did this . however , act of a single , misguided employee or not , the corporation alone bears responsibility for afterwards spurning a number of opportunities to offer the rescue workers their money back or apologize to them \u2014 though the coffee giant finally took both those actions , they did so only after the <MASK> attracted online and print media attention . <PARA> in addition to the \u201c rescue workers charged for water \u201d and the \u201c spurned servicemen \u201d <MASK> that is the focus of this piece , starbucks has been the butt of a number of other unsavory <MASK> and mistaken beliefs just in the past few years , including : <PARA> starbucks , like any other successful corporation that has a strong public presence , is fated to operate with the damocles sword of public opinion hanging above its head . no corporation can fund everyone who comes to it looking for assistance , which means some deserving groups will always be refused . in less emotionally - charged times , the logic of such a policy is better understood , but the current climate makes it a dicey public relations proposition at best to say no to anything having to do with soldiers . <PARA> variations : an april 2007 version of this <MASK> changed starbucks to oscar mayer and coffee to hot dogs . in response , oscar mayer posted a denial on its web site :",

construction border fencing at otay mesa , california . he <MASK> that , in order to test the structure \u2019 s resistance , the administration had invited 20 \u201c world - class mountain - climbers \u201d to attempt to scale various border - fence prototypes . \u201c this was the one that was hardest to climb ,\u201d trump said , gesturing toward the fence . he continued : <PARA> \u201c we \u2019 ve all seen the pictures of young people climbing walls with drugs on their back . a lot of drugs , they \u2019 re unbelievable climbers . this wall can \u2019 t be climbed . this is very , very hard . what the panel does on top , as i said , is structural , but it \u2019 s also very hard to get by that panel . plus , it \u2019 s designed to absorb heat . so it \u2019 s extremely hot . the wall is \u2014 you won \u2019 t be able to touch it , you can fry an egg on that wall . it \u2019 s very , very hot . so <MORE> known as azteca uno ), and can be viewed below : <PARA> trump appeared to reference this very video in his september 2019 remarks , saying \u201c we \u2019 ve all seen the pictures of young people climbing walls with drugs on their back . ... this wall can \u2019 t be climbed .\u201d so the president was saying that the wall next to him , at otay mesa , could not be climbed , unlike the type of wall seen in the march 2016 video footage . it is therefore particularly disingenuous for online commentators to use that very footage to undermine or ridicule trump \u2019 s <MASK> . <PARA> the two fence models bore certain similarities , but did appear to have significant differences . in particular , the fence climbed in a matter of seconds at nogales , in march 2016 , visibly did not have a panel at the top ( as the newer model does ) \u2014 a feature that might well have prevented the young men from surmounting the fence and making their descent on the other side . <PARA> the graphic below shows the top of the fence climbed in march 2016 , on the left , and the top of the fence that the president said \u201c can \u2019 t be climbed ,\u201d in september 2019 : <PARA> in a september tweet , <USER> used a still image of several men climbing a fence in order to illustrate the <MASK> that , contrary to the president \u2019 s assertions , \u201c mexicans have turned trump \u2019 s wall into a tourist attraction and are playing a game to see who can climb it the fastest .\u201d <PARA> however , that image did not show the specific model of fence the president described as a \u201c very , very hard thing to climb .\u201d rather , it showed a stretch of fencing at san ysidro , california , captured by nbc news in november 2018 : <PARA> the san ysidro fence was clearly different from the one unveiled by trump in september 2019 . it appeared to be considerably shorter , and it also lacked the paneling present at the top of the otay mesa fence , as shown in the graphic below : <PARA> overall , the social media posts that endeavored to ridicule or undermine trump \u2019 s boasts about the new model of border fencing at otay mesa were grossly misleading , because they used video and still images taken from other fences at other locations and at earlier dates , and those fences had significant and substantive structural differences from the fencing unveiled in september 2019 . <PARA> posts that used video footage of two young men scaling a border fence in march 2016 were especially disingenuous , because trump himself specifically contrasted the integrity of the fencing seen in that footage with the newer model of fencing that he showed off to the media in september 2019 .",

[ their symptoms were ] indistinguishable from a lot of outbreaks that we \u2019 ve seen [ that involved only ] synthetic cannabinoids .\u201d <PARA> \u201c the idea that this is somehow unique or different from the clinical effects of the synthetic cannabinoids alone [ has not been demonstrated ], at least so far ,\u201d rusyniak said . the indiana incident , is , however , distinct from the previous events alleged to be part of the trend in that the primary drug was synthetic marijuana , not methamphetamine . <PARA> there are two cases , though only one has been confirmed , in which a crystallized form of bug spray is alleged to have been added to methamphetamine , and these events resulted in symptoms consistent with an aggressive methamphetamine high . the final case , in contrast , involved the unconfirmed assertion that bug spray , in liquid form , was sprayed to synthetic marijuana ( to enhance the high or perhaps throw drug dogs off the scent ) and resulted in symptoms consistent with a synthetic marijuana overdose . the collection of these three events does not coherently create a narrative that can be considered an \u201c alarming trend ,\u201d but because at least one credible report documents a case in which someone intentionally injected raid ( mixed with methamphetamine ), we rank the assertion of a surge in the number of people using \u201c bug spray \u201d to get high as mostly <MASK> .",

( coca - cola is <MASK> to follow a similar policy .) <PARA> though the exact formulation is not known to the public , the company is adamant that dr pepper doesn \u2019 t now contain prune juice , nor did it at any time in the beverage \u2019 s <MASK> . <PARA> no one really knows how this belief came to be attached to the soft drink , although speculation runs rampant that a long - ago competitor \u2019 s deliveryman tried to discourage those on his route from stocking their stores with the product by making this outrageous <MASK> to undermine it . dr pepper is a dark liquid , making the notion that another dark liquid could be been surreptitiously slipped into the concoction fall within the realm of possibility . that , plus its unclassifiable flavor is enough to <PARA> render the <MASK> faintly plausible . prunes , of course , are somewhat reviled for their association with prompting bowel movements , an association that supplies the \u201c ewww !\u201d factor necessary to keep the <MASK> going . ( not that this was always the case , however : sixteenth century <MASK> attributed sexual potency to prunes , which resulted in prunes being freely handed out in brothels .) <PARA> the prune <MASK> is not the only bit of lore attached to this popular drink : controversy also exists over how the beverage gained its name . this ubiquitous texas <PARA> refresher was created in 1885 by waco pharmacist charles alderton , who worked for morrison \u2019 s old corner drug store . according to lore , wade morrison , owner of <PARA> the store and himself a pharmacist , had <MASK> toiled in a virginia drugstore owned by dr . charles pepper . while employed there , he had fallen for the doctor \u2019 s daughter , even going so far as to propose marriage . his hopes were dashed , however , when her disapproving father summarily put an end to things , causing the heartbroken swain to pull up stakes and move to texas . when alderton was casting about for a name for his new concoction , morrison supposedly offered the sardonic suggestion of \u201c dr . pepper \u201d. <PARA> in another version , morrison , still carrying a torch for his beloved miss pepper even after he \u2019 d settled in texas , persuaded his partner to honor her by naming it after her father . <PARA> that \u2019 s the lore of the matter , but the facts are a bit different . pepper \u2019 s daughter was born in 1874 , which means morrison left for texas when the girl was but eight years old . her extreme youth rules out all of the \u201c failed romance \u201d explanations morrison was fond of regaling the credulous with . the most likely explanation for the name is the confluence of two factors : the then - common habit of preceding product names with \u201c dr .\u201d to make them sound more healthful , and morrison \u2019 s once having worked for a physician with an unusual surname . <PARA> here \u2019 s another oddball pepper fact : the period after the \u201c dr \u201d went missing in 1950 when the company changed the font used to write the name . when presented in this new style , the lower case \u201c r \u201d consisted of a small slanted line with a dot at its upper right . well and good , but when a period was trailed after that new - fangled \u201c r \u201d, the period and the r \u2019 s dot seemed to form a colon and alter the \u201c r \u201d into an \u201c i \u201d. with the period there , \u201c dr . pepper \u201d looked like \u201c di : pepper \u201d. the solution was to drop the period . <PARA> the font has changed again since then , but the period remains awol . <PARA> barbara \u201c blackout period \u201d mikkelson",

to - middle - class americans . <PARA> specifically , biden \u2019 s tax plan would roll back the act \u2019 s income tax reductions for the country \u2019 s top bracket of taxpayers , as well as expand that category to include americans with incomes over $ 400 , 000 annually , rather than just those who earn more than $ 518 , 400 . <PARA> his proposal would also require that group of top earners to limit deductions and pay an additional social security payroll tax , per an analysis by howard gleckman , a senior fellow with the nonpartisan urban - brookings tax policy center . millionaires and billionaires would be subject to taxes on long - term capital gains at ordinary \u2014 not preferential \u2014 income tax rates . <PARA> additionally , biden \u2019 s plan would increase the top tax rate for corporations from 21 % to 28 % and impose a 15 % minimum tax on companies \u2019 book income , according to his campaign website . it would also reduce tax subsidies for commercial real <MASK> and fossil fuels and incentivize renewable energy investments , among other changes . <PARA> all of that said , the country \u2019 s richest taxpayers and corporations would cover the majority of biden \u2019 s proposed tax increases \u2014 not average americans \u2014 both in dollar amounts and as a share of their incomes . <PARA> but let \u2019 s look at the anticipated impact at <MORE> s plan ( we explain more below ), though the highest - income households would pay higher income taxes directly and see substantially larger increases than anyone else . gleckman made the following estimations : <PARA> that added burden on low - and middle - income households \u2014 representing about 2 % of the proposed change \u2014 would be an indirect result of employers shifting the cost of the higher corporate tax rate to some workers . corporations on a grand scale would slightly lower wages and investment income , which would , on average , more than offset the effects of biden \u2019 s new tax credits , the center concluded . <PARA> alicyn mcleod , a tax adviser and writer for accounting today , said in october 2020 : <PARA> in sum , the overwhelming majority of americans \u2014 those who earn $ 400 , 000 or less annually \u2014 would not see their taxes increase as a direct result of biden \u2019 s tax proposal , and the top 1 % earners would shoulder the brunt of his proposed hike . but low - to - middle - class workers would see slightly lower investment returns and wages as a result of corporate tax increases , according to economists \u2019 analysis including a a budgetary model by the wharton school of the university of pennsylvania . <PARA> biden \u2019 s plan would raise about $ 3 . 38 trillion in additional tax revenue over 10 years , according to the university \u2019 s model . <PARA> concurrently , per gleckman \u2019 s analysis , that would amount to an increase in federal revenue by about 1 . 5 % of the country \u2019 s gross domestic product ( gdp ). gdp is the economy \u2019 s total output of goods and services , and economists rely on it greatly to measure the economy \u2019 s health and how fiscal or regulatory policies could impact it \u2014 not raw dollar amounts that don \u2019 t consider inflation and population changes . <PARA> to determine the legitimacy of trump \u2019 s <MASK> , we considered federal tax proposals and their impact on gdp over decades . of almost two dozen congressional tax bills that increased federal tax revenues between 1940 and 2012 , for example , the five largest tax increases raised annual revenue between 1 . 33 % and 5 . 04 % of gdp , according to a 2013 compilation of such records by the u . s . department of treasury . <PARA> the following table compiled by the tax foundation , another independent public policy think tank , showed where biden \u2019 s plan would stand in comparison to those other proposals : <PARA> according to those findings , biden \u2019 s tax proposal , if enacted by congress , would amount to the fifth - largest tax increase since the 1940s \u2014 not the biggest hike in modern u . s . <MASK> .",

nobody would have introduced him back then as \u201c hollywood \u2019 s newest sensation \u201d), but its details are flat - out wrong . <MORE> following week \u2019 s episode ( entitled \u201c the cat and mouse \u201d). however , as leonard maltin has noted : <PARA> a recording of that suspense episode bears maltin out on this point . joseph cotten \u2019 s introduction of sonny tufts at the conclusion of that episode was a perfectly straightforward one : <PARA> in retrospect , it \u2019 s easy to trace the arc of this legend , which wasn \u2019 t contemporaneous with tufts \u2019 early days in the movie business ( when it allegedly took place ) but only began to spread several years later , when tufts had become the subject of much public ridicule for other reasons . tufts never rose above his <MASK> as a minor actor , and by the 1950s his drinking problems had established him as far more of a hollywood joke than a hollywood star . among his reported drunken escapades were : <PARA> o 1948 : actor edward troy fractured his knee while \u201c riding piggyback on movie star sonny tufts \u201d at an arizona resort hotel . <PARA> o 1950 : tufts and three companions were arrested for public drunkenness after los angeles police spotted them \u201c tight - rope \u201d walking along white traffic lines in the middle of a street . <PARA> o 1951 : tufts \u2019 wife sued him for separate maintenance , <MASK> that he had been jobless for over a year and was \u201c dissipating their community property \u201d on alcohol and lavish living . three days later , tufts ( along with hawaiian actress luukiana kaeloa ) was arrested as a \u201c transient drunk \u201d after engaging in a heated argument with a night club cook over an unpaid bill for $ 4 . 55 worth of fried chicken . <PARA> o 1954 : tufts was sued by two female dancers who <MASK> he had bitten both of them on the thighs ( in separate incidents ). <PARA> o 1955 : tufts was sued by a 22 - year old woman who <MASK> the actor approached her in a restaurant , \u201c mauled her , then pinched her so hard she screamed .\u201d <PARA> o 1957 : tufts and a female companion were jailed for public drunkenness after he passed out on a sunset strip sidewalk in hollywood ( and his companion then fell on top of him ), suffering a cut above his left eye which required four stitches to close . <PARA> radio was the one medium in which tufts had once essayed roles on equal footing with hollywood \u2019 s leading stars , and after he declined in <MASK> to little more than a hollywood punchline , one could look back with wonder that he had ever worked among such august company . from there it was a short step to retroactively creating a gag set years earlier , about a real actor \u2019 s supposed reaction to someone whose name would later became a joke .",

marriage ) as \u201c substantially similar .\u201d <PARA> what this meant was that , in principle , even voters whose last names had changed since they registered to vote could cast full ballots ( as opposed to a provisional ballots ) without any requirement to bring additional documentation to the polling <MASK> . the only differences in their voting experiences were that they would have to sign sworn affidavits and check a box labeled \u201c similar name \u201d on their ballots . <PARA> it \u2019 s possible that some voters might be discouraged from voting by these requirements ( especially the requirement to sign a sworn affidavit ), or that some election clerks might not be comprehensively trained in the relevant procedures , or that a confusion or delay over names might prompt a voter who was pressed for time to give up on casting a ballot . <PARA> however , the meme was wrong in its <MASK> that the photo id <MORE> , which is well summarized here . in 2017 , the texas <MASK> legislature passed a new photo id law called s . b . 5 , which somewhat relaxed the id requirements and gained u . s . court of appeals approval in april 2018 . <PARA> a spokesperson for the secretary of <MASK> \u2019 s office confirmed to us that the procedures relating to \u201c substantially similar \u201d names had not changed under s . b . 5 and remained as they were under s . b . 14 . therefore , the meme \u2019 s <MASK> about divorce documents and birth and marriage certificates were as inaccurate about the law in october 2018 as they were in october 2013 . <PARA> the latest official guidelines for election judges and clerks in texas outline the procedures that are relevant to voters whose last names have changed since they registered to vote : <PARA> these guidelines have not changed since 2014 , when s . b . 14 was still in place . <PARA> conclusion <PARA> the 2013 meme referred to a real voter id controversy in texas and a 2011 law ( s . b . 14 ) which did create certain specific requirements for voting that could disproportionately impact women because of the tradition of hanging surnames after marriage . however , s . b . 14 did not , in 2013 , \u201c prevent \u201d women from voting outright , as the meme <MASK> . nor did a 2017 version of the photo id law ( s . b . 5 .) \u201c prevent \u201d anyone from voting outright . <PARA> rather , the photo id law ( in both its incarnations ) meant voters whose names were different on their photo ids than on the voter rolls could still cast ballots provided they signed sworn affidavits and checked a box labeled \u201c similar name .\u201d <PARA> the meme made two more specific factual <MASK> . first , that a \u201c voter card must match [ a ] birth certificate .\u201d this is inaccurate : texas law requires that the name on a voter \u2019 s photo id must be at least substantially similar to their name as listed on the voter roll . the voter \u2019 s birth certificate does not come into the equation . <PARA> second , the meme alleged that \u201c if a woman has been married , divorced and re - married then she must bring both marriage certificates and divorce documents in order to vote !\u201d this is also <MASK> . in order to cast a ballot ( i . e . \u201c in order to vote \u201d) a voter whose last name has changed need only sign an affidavit swearing that they are the same person listed on the register , and check the box on their ballot paper marked \u201c similar name .\u201d there is no requirement to present marriage certificates or divorce documents at polling <MASK> .",

        "text": "now that it seems nearly every human activity has a computer - or internet - based equivalent ( e . g ., cybersex , e - mail , online chats ), it should probably come as no surprise that even a concept such as \u201c black friday \u201d also has a digital counterpart , one dubbed \u201c cyber monday .\u201d <PARA> just as black friday ( the day after thanksgiving ) is supposedly the busiest \u201c brick and mortar \u201d shopping day of the year in the u . s ., so cyber monday ( the monday after thanksgiving ) is supposedly the busiest online shopping day of the year . but even though black friday may be the day that the largest number of consumers traipse through malls and shopping centers to look at goods , it isn \u2019 t really the highest - volume sales day ( in terms of dollars spent ) of the year . likewise , although cyber monday might be a day when a lot of computer users pile onto the internet to check out wares offered by online vendors , it isn \u2019 t the day most of them are buying stuff online . <PARA> in terms of overall online sales , cyber monday historically ranks as one of the busiest e - commerce days of the year . certainly many , many consumers ( including those who braved the black friday sales crush but didn \u2019 t come away with the purchases they wanted , and those who didn \u2019 t even try ) hit the internet that day to browse e - commerce sites , as the thanksgiving holiday has ended , thoughts have turned towards christmas , and people have returned to work ( where many of them have more solitude and better internet access than they do at home ). but although e - shoppers may do a lot of looking and browsing and comparing and even a good deal of buying on cyber monday , they aren \u2019 t placing nearly enough orders to make that day the year \u2019 s # 1 online sales day . <PARA> so where did the concept of cyber monday as the \u201c busiest online shopping day \u201d <MASK> ? as businessweek noted in 2005 , the term was something created by a retailers association as a promotional scheme : <PARA> so what \u2019 s up with this cyber monday idea ? a little bit of reality and a whole lot of savvy marketing . it turns out that shop . org , an association for retailers that sell online , dreamed up the term just days before putting out a nov . 21 press release touting cyber monday as \u201c one of the biggest online shopping days of the year .\u201d the idea was born when a few people at the organization were brainstorming about how to promote online shopping , says shop . org executive director scott silverman . they quickly discarded suggestions such as black monday ( too much like black friday ), blue monday ( not very cheery ), and green monday ( too environmentalist ), and settled on cyber monday . \u201c it \u2019 s not the biggest day ,\u201d silverman concedes . \u201c but it was an opportunity to create some consumer excitement .\u201d <PARA> the genesis of the concept goes back even further . shop . org member shmuel gniwisch , chief executive of the online jewelry site ice . com , recalls getting an e - mail from shop . org [ in 2004 ], suggesting that online retailers come up with their own marketing hook to match black friday . \u201c the online guys got together and said , \u2018 let \u2019 s give people something different ,'\u201d he says . \u201c the reality is , we didn \u2019 t notice anything special \u201d on the monday after thanksgiving . <PARA> typically , the busiest \u201c real \u201d shopping day of the year occurs on the saturday before christmas , and the busiest e - shopping day takes place on a monday or tuesday a week ( or two ) before the week in which christmas falls . ( according to paypal , the most popular cybershopping day in 2008 was not the monday after thanksgiving , but the second monday in december .) also , because more consumers now have high - speed internet access at home , many of them no longer wait until they return to work on the monday following the four - day thanksgiving break to look for deals ; instead , the day that generates the most web traffic to online retail sites is thanksgiving day itself , as avid shoppers use the internet to plan their strategies for black friday weekend sales at \u201c brick and mortar \u201d stores : <PARA> but the tide seems to be changing as americans spend more time online . in 2016 , american customers spent more than $ 3 billion on cyber monday , according to marketing blog adobe digital insights , making it the biggest single day in online commerce ( so far ). <PARA> black friday is still a contender , though \u2014 the day after thanksgiving generated more than $ 650 billion in spending in the united <MASK> in 2016 , up about 3 . 6 percent from the year before , including online sales . \u201c super saturday \u201c, for its part , was so successful that it was rolled into several days of sales and promotional events leading up to christmas . <PARA> in late november 2017 , reports appeared that cyber monday had , as promised , become the single largest online shopping day of the year , with americans spending a record $ 6 . 59 billion , up nearly 17 percent from the year before .",

        "text": "<MASK> : on 13 october 2015 the gun control advocacy group everytown for gun safety tweeted the above - reproduced graph that visually contrasts the rate of gun murders in the united <MASK> versus compared to fifteen other countries . a large bar representing the united <MASK> depicted a rate of 3 . 7 gun murders per 100 , 000 residents per year , with the pictured country with the next highest rate being italy , with a mere 0 . 68 murders per 100 , 000 resident . <PARA> small print at the bottom of the chart cited a january 2011 <MASK> in the journal trauma , titled \u201c homicide , suicide , and unintentional firearm fatality : comparing the united <MASK> with other high - income countries \u201d as the source for its <MASK> . ( notably missing from the <MASK> \u2019 s title was its final word : \u201c 2003 .\u201d) that citation provided some context for the comparative data illustrated by the chart , primarily that the provided <MASK> referenced \u201c high - income countries .\u201d but that context was misleadingly elided in the creation of the chart , leaving viewers to surmise that the united <MASK> was first ( by far ) among all countries with respect to gun murders . moreover , the 2015 chart cited research published in 2011 , which in turn referenced homicide rates from 2003 ( not 2015 ). <PARA> using the same centers for disease control ( cdc ) mortality data tool we used to verify a similar gun death rate <MASK> , we were able to locate the specific metric ( rate of gun - related homicides per 100 , 000 people ) referenced by the chart . in 2003 ( the year from which the 2011 <MASK> \u2019 s data was pulled ) the rate was 4 . 11 ( not 3 . 7 ), and the rate in 2013 ( the most recent year for which such <MASK> were available ) was 3 . 55 . <PARA> although those difference may not meaningfully impact the chart \u2019 s assertions , other factors render it highly misleading . as noted earlier , the chart title (\u201c gun murders per 100 , 000 residents \u201d) hints that the united <MASK> comes in at the top globally in rate of gun murders , but the <MASK> from which the chart was sourced (\u201c homicide , suicide , and unintentional firearm fatality : comparing the united <MASK> with other high - income countries , 2003 \u201d) contrasted the u . s . only with what it categorized as \u201c high - income \u201d nations . ( compared to all countries in the world , the united <MASK> ranks significantly lower in this metric .) while an argument could be made about the validity of comparing gun homicide rates in countries with similar economic conditions , viewers who stumbled upon the chart out of context had no way of knowing that it referenced only a specific subset of the world \u2019 s nations . <PARA> as we noted in a previous <MASK> about gun deaths in the united <MASK> compared to the rest of the world , the u . s ranks behind dozens of other nations ( for both gun - related murders and non - gun - related homicides . the uk guardian newspaper ported comprehensive gun homicide numbers onto a spreadsheet in 2012 [ doc ] based on then - recent data compiled by the united nations office on drugs and crime ( unodc ) culled from various agencies worldwide , and that information enabled readers to more meaningfully assess how the u . s compared to other countries in terms of the actual rate of gun homicides . the combined data provided a total per capita gun homicide rate for the u . s . of 2 . 99 , which ranked it behind 27 other nations ( including brazil , puerto rico , honduras , and south africa ). <PARA> so while the chart provides a roughly accurate rate of firearm - related murders in the u . s per 100 , 000 people , it elides several meaningful bits of context ( including its use of older <MASK> ) and fails to denote that several other countries maintain higher rates of gun murders than the united <MASK> when the world as a whole is considered . <PARA> <MASK> published : 2 november 2015",

<PARA> it is also <MASK> that soros survived the german occupation of budapest by becoming a nazi \u201c collaborator .\u201d fox news pundit glenn beck alleged in november 2010 , for example , that the 14 - year - old soros \u201c help [ ed ] the government confiscate the lands of his fellow jewish friends and neighbors ,\u201d and , worse ( in beck \u2019 s view ), was unrepentant about it : <PARA> \u201c i don \u2019 t want to question the 14 - year - old ,\u201d beck disingenuously <MASK> during a series of broadcasts devoted to painting soros as an evil \u201c puppet - master \u201d of the left . \u201c i would have , however , liked to question the 80 <MORE> was in danger of exposure , shipped him off to spend the summer of 1944 with his mother ( who herself was living under an assumed name at a lakeside resort some distance from budapest ). george soros spent no further time with baumbach . <PARA> did soros serve jews with death or deportation notices ? <PARA> another \u201c nazi collaborator \u201d trope holds that young george soros helped send fellow jews to their deaths by delivering deportation notices on behalf of budapest \u2019 s jewish council ( judenrat in german ), an organization tasked by the nazis with helping enforce nazi policies on the hungarian jewish population : <PARA> however , as in the case of the \u201c confiscation \u201d <MASK> already discussed , here we find innocuous facts about george soros \u2019 s adolescence twisted and exaggerated into a grotesque lie . according to soros \u2019 s father , school - age jewish children were required to run errands for the council . among those errands ( he came to find out ) was delivering deportation notices to prominent jews . but although george did , in fact , spend all of two days as a jewish council errand boy , he didn \u2019 t perform his assigned tasks exactly as ordered , taking it upon himself to warn the recipients of the notices that they ought not to comply : <PARA> did soros say helping the nazis was the happiest time of his life ? <PARA> in a foreword george soros wrote for a 2011 reprint of masquerade , he described the ten months of the nazi occupation as \u201c the happiest times of my life \u201d: <PARA> predictably , this <MASK> has been repurposed by soros \u2019 s political enemies , usually in tandem with the <MASK> <MASK> that he was a nazi collaborator , as an admission of moral bankruptcy : <PARA> but at no time did soros say \u201c helping nazis \u201d was the happiest time of his life . as he has reiterated on numerous occasions , what he was referring to was the exhilaration of surviving the most perilous situation he and his family would ever face , under the guidance and tutelage of his father , whom george soros saw as a heroic figure . \u201c it was his finest hour ,\u201d soros said of his father in his 2007 book , the age of fallibility : <PARA> anti - defamation league <MASK> <PARA> one of the ironies of these attacks on soros based on his survival of the nazi occupation is that they use his own ( and his father \u2019 s ) candid remembrances of the experience to vilify him . as holocaust survivor and anti - defamation league director abraham foxman <MASK> in response to glenn beck \u2019 s attempted takedown of soros in 2010 , regardless of how one feels about the adult george soros and his politics , the attacks are morally repugnant and unacceptable :",

million times within its first 72 hours of existence . the video , though quite brief , packs a lot of emotional wallop in a few words \u2014 most of which were copied verbatim from a viral facebook post <MASK> attributed to reeves in 2015 : <PARA> with all due respect to mr . reeves ( who , as far as we know , had nothing to do with the making of the video ), we are now obliged to assess its veracity , <MASK> by <MASK> : <PARA> at age 3 , his father left . <PARA> more - or - less <MASK> . reeves was born in beirut , lebanon to a british mother and a chinese - hawaiian father in 1964 . biographical accounts vary as to precisely how old keanu was when his ne \u2019 er - do - well father , samuel nowlin reeves , abandoned the family . some say samuel left when keanu was age two , some at age three , and the father himself is on record saying he moved out when keanu was five , though he was still in his son \u2019 s life until he was about 13 . \u201c i spent my last vacation with him when i was 13 years old ,\u201d keanu said in a 2002 interview . \u201c on our last day we sat on the veranda and stared at the dark sky . he hardly said anything that evening . the next day he brought us to the airport . then we didn \u2019 t hear anything from him for 10 years . no calls , no letters , nothing .\u201d <PARA> he attended 4 different high schools and struggled with dyslexia , making education very difficult . <PARA> mostly <MASK> . reeves said in a 2008 interview with the daily mail that he attended four high schools in the space of five years but was \u201c okay academically .\u201d vanity fair reported in 1995 that both keanu and his sister , kim , are dyslexic . however , reeves has also said that he didn \u2019 t do all that badly in school . he was asked about it by tara brady of the irish times : <PARA> at age 23 , his best friend river phoenix died of a drug overdose . <PARA> <MASK> . actor river phoenix , whom reeves had known for a few years and became close friends with <MORE> . but the child was stillborn , and it cost them their relationship . <PARA> <MASK> . people magazine published this account of the stillbirth in april 2001 : <PARA> ( note : the image supposedly showing jennifer syme in the video is actually a photograph of someone else .) <PARA> 18 months later , jennifer was killed in a car accident . <PARA> <MASK> . this account is from people magazine : <PARA> his sister had leukemia . she was cured , and he donated 70 percent of his money from \u201c the matrix \u201d to hospitals that treat leukemia . <PARA> partly <MASK> . as best we can put together from press reports over the years , kim reeves , who is a few years younger than keanu , was diagnosed with leukemia around 1991 and , after battling the disease for nearly a decade , was in remission as of 1999 . a woman \u2019 s day ( australia ) <MASK> published in april of that year said keanu had \u201c lovingly supported \u201d his sister throughout her illness . media reports as recent as 2015 still describe kim reeves as \u201c battling leukemia \u201d \u2014 as if there was a relapse \u2014 but it \u2019 s unclear to what extent that \u2019 s based on hard <MASK> . the <MASK> that keanu reeves donated 70 percent of his matrix earnings to hospitals that treat leukemia appears to have been fabricated , though we \u2019 ve found plenty of <MASK> to indicate he is a frequent and generous contributor to all sorts of charitable causes . in a ladies home journal <MASK> published in 2009 , he said he had started a private charitable foundation : <PARA> he doesn \u2019 t own a big house like other stars , and he doesn \u2019 t wear fancy clothes . <PARA> mixture . you wouldn \u2019 t describe reeves \u2019 s $ 4 million two -

        "text": "although many scams involve the use of telephones to contact or extract information from potential victims , a few varieties of fraud target telephone service itself as a means of obtaining ill - gotten revenue from unsuspecting prey . one common variety of telephone service fraud involves obtaining information or employing trickery that allows the scammer to place long - distance calls and bill them to someone else ( as in the #- 9 - 0 scam ), and another common variety involves duping consumers into running up hefty fees on their own telephone bills ( as in the 809 area code scam ). <PARA> in december 2005 , many uk residents were targets of the latter variety of scam , one that attempted to lure them into placing calls to a premium rate number and keep them on the line for several minutes . ( premium rate or \u201c pay - per - call \u201d numbers typically generate revenue by providing information or entertainment in exchange for a per - minute fee , which is billed to the caller \u2019 s phone number . such services are commonly known as \u201c 900 numbers \u201c in north america and \u201c 090 numbers \u201c in the uk , although other prefixes may be used as well .) <PARA> the bait for this scam was the distribution of official - looking postcards bearing the name \u201c parcel delivery services \u201d ( pds ) to residences , each card <MASK> that a package was awaiting delivery ( usually one said to contain a digital camera ) and that the recipient needed to call pds to obtain a \u201c security confirmation code \u201d to effect delivery of the parcel . what many consumers failed to notice ( or heed ), however , was the small print on the card informing them that the phone number provided was a premium rate number with a whopping \u00a3 1 . 50 per - minute fee . as the bbc wales x - ray consumer investigation service found when they placed a call to the pds number : <PARA> not surprisingly , investigators failed to turn up any complainants who actually received digital cameras from pds , and phonepayplus ( formerly the independent committee for the supervision of standards of telephone information , aka icstis ), the group that oversees premium rate services in the uk , removed access to the service ( which was using up to 20 different phone numbers ) on 29 december 2005 . ( pds was run through studio telecom , a service provider registered in belize , which had previously been fined and barred by phonepayplus for using misleading direct mail promotions to generate calls to their service .) <PARA> because the internet - circulated warning did not just up and go away in december 2005 once the problem was sreolved , people continued to spread the alert in e - mail , prompting phonepayplus to add an explanation to their web site in october 2007 ( and again in updated forms in october 2009 and november 2010 ): <PARA> although the specific warning e - mail reproduced at the head of this page is out of date , it represents a common form of telephone fraud that has been used in the past and will likely be used again , so the public is well advised to be aware of it . uk telephone customers who find unexpected premium rate charges on their phone bills can obtain more information by looking up the associated phone numbers via the number checking facility on the phonepayplus web site , and they can file complaints about premium rate services through phonepayplus \u2019 online complaint form . u . s . residents can file complaints about premium rate services through an online form available on the web site of the federal trade commission ( ftc ).",

( the artist \u2019 s point was supposedly to highlight the hypocrisy demonstrated by people \u2019 s making an apparently sick and ill - fed dog the center of attention when it was presented as an art exhibit , even though many of them would ignore the same dog if they encountered it roaming the streets .) <PARA> we haven \u2019 t yet been able to confirm whether the circumstances of the exhibit were as commonly represented , however . the most extreme <MASK> about this exhibit maintain that the dog was continually mistreated , confined in the gallery and denied food and <PARA> water for several days until it finally starved to death . other accounts <MASK> that the exhibit was deliberately set up so that the dog <PARA> appeared to be neglected while the gallery was open to the public , but the animal was otherwise properly cared for . yet other reports ( such as an <MASK> about the exhibit published in the nicaraguan newspaper la prensa ) <MASK> the gallery \u2019 s director as asserting that the dog was in fact well - fed , and that it had not died ( of starvation or any other cause ) but had escaped from the gallery during <MORE> it seems that there is little more that can be done to address this issue , and as we have very limited resources , we must direct them where we can most effectively promote animal welfare . we will , however , continue to monitor the situation in case further action can be taken at any time . <PARA> the wspa is well aware of this situation . it does appear that the facts have been <MASK> in some news <MASK> , however . the artist is costa rican , and this one - time exhibit happened in a nicaraguan art gallery last october . it involved one dog , and this dog was not replaced by another after it had died . while there is an animal cruelty law in costa rica , there is no such legislation in nicaragua ; so unfortunately the artist did not break the law by mistreating this dog . as far as we are aware , he is not planning on doing this exact same thing again , but the controversy now lies in the fact that he has been chosen to represent costa rica at the central american biennial , set to take place in honduras this year , with an exhibit apparently not involving a dog this time . <PARA> the news of the exhibit did not seem to get picked up by the costa rican press until about a month after it happened . even then there was very little coverage and it was never made clear whether the dog actually died , how long it was there and why nobody did anything if it was suffering . following this , people around the world began protesting against vargas , and our costa rica office issued a <MASK> in response to this act . a member society of ours in honduras ( ahpra ) also took action and wrote a <MASK> which was sent to the appropriate authorities in honduras . <PARA> the wspa costa rica office has also contacted the ministry of art and culture , to urge them to consider disallowing vargas from representing costa rica at the central american biennial . the response was that since vargas was participating at the biennial with a different exhibit , they could not ban him from attending . <PARA> this issue is of concern to the wspa , and it is unfortunate that this artist will be able to gain publicity through this second exhibition despite his previous display involving mistreatment of this dog . the wspa is completely opposed to the use of animals for entertainment purposes . despite this , it seems that there is little more that can be done to address this issue , and as we have very limited resources , we must direct them where we can most effectively promote animal welfare . we will , however , continue to monitor the situation in case further action can be taken at any time .",

        "text": "<MASK> : in mid - 2014 , a <MASK> started to circulate online <MASK> that nabisco had announced the creation of a fried chicken flavor of oreo cookies . although the concept might have seemed implausible to some , the company had previously unveiled unusual flavor variations of the popular oreo cookie ( including watermelon and candy corn ), so several blogs reported the <MASK> as straight news . <PARA> however , the <MASK> was almost immediately quashed by nabisco on 17 july 2014 , when a representative of the company officially denied the existence of the unusual flavor : <PARA> [ a ] pr person confirmed on behalf of the company , in a response to an inquiry , that the fried chicken flavor doesn \u2019 t exist . <PARA> \u201c the flavor you are referring to is in fact not real ,\u201d said lindsay kaplan , a weber shandwick employee , wrote in an email . <PARA> \u201c the flavor you are referring to is in fact not real ,\u201d said lindsay kaplan , a weber shandwick employee , wrote in an email . <PARA> on the same day , a representative for nabisco explained in a separate interview that the fried chicken oreo image was fan - generated and was not <MASK> of a limited edition or test flavor : <PARA> \u201c a fan who really liked the fruit punch flavor came up with the fried chicken oreo packaging photo as a sort of joke . it \u2019 s clearly gotten some traction over the internet , but the fried chicken oreo flavor is fake .\u201d <PARA> the <MASK> died down after nabisco \u2019 s initial denial , but it resurged in early 2015 in part because during the intervening months , a similar <MASK> featuring red velvet flavor oreos arose that bore many of the same elements as its predecessor : like the <MASK> fried chicken oreos , red velvet oreos were allegedly spotted in test markets , and images of the packaging were shared on the internet . and , after initial denials , nabisco did later introduce the red velvet product as a limited edition product . <PARA> it \u2019 s possible that the path blazed by red velvet oreos from <MASK> to real - life convinced social media users that the fried chicken oreo was also destined for a glass of milk near you . but there is no <MASK> that nabisco has yet seriously considered manufacturing a flavor with such limited appeal .",

this was someone \u2019 s baby . one is thus encouraged to view the car thief more as a kidnapper than a mere vehicle booster and to agree with the thrust of the <MASK> : the scoundrel got what he deserved . <PARA> it is that theme of just deserts served up in full portion that speeds this legend along . no one relishes the thought of being victimized in a crime , and compounding that distaste is the knowledge that all too often the perpetrators get away with their misdeeds . in this legend at least , the wrong - doer was brought to justice by his criminal action . had he not been making off with a stolen vehicle , he wouldn \u2019 t have lost his life . <PARA> just as the dead thief legend surfaces in the wake of major u . s . earthquakes , so too does the beloved chestnut about a mysterious hitchhiker who just prior to the disaster delivers a dire prophecy from the back seat of a car moments before disappearing into thin air . the doom - saying hitchhiker is a version of the well - known vanishing hitchhiker legend . <PARA> barbara \u201c hitch in the plans \u201d mikkelson",

( in idaho , a woman must wait 24 hours after receiving \u201c <MASK> - directed counseling that includes information designed to discourage her from having an abortion \u201d before undergoing the procedure .) coons wanted the procedure done expeditiously before the fetus developed any further . <PARA> coons and her family used \u201c all economic resources available to them at the time to pay the $ 400 fee for the abortion and make the trip ,\u201d according to court documents . she took the first pill in the two - pill regimen at planned parenthood , was given instruction for \u201c further oral administration ,\u201d and then returned home to boise . <PARA> the next day coons visited a hospital emergency room complaining of nausea and dizziness . she was treated for dehydration , and medical staff there told her that her fetus had a strong heartbeat . the doctor caring for her called the albuquerque clinic asking whether she should continue with the second abortion pill and received an affirmative answer . <PARA> according to court documents , even after taking both doses of the abortion - inducing drugs , coons was still pregnant with a viable fetus , but she didn \u2019 t have the financial means to pay for another procedure in idaho or return to new mexico to follow up with the clinic that gave her the medication . <PARA> coons contacted the planned parenthood facility in albuquerque in early march 2016 to inform them she was still pregnant , but by that time she felt morally opposed to continuing the effort to undergo an abortion due to the more advanced stage of development of the fetus . <PARA> the couple was notified that the abortion medication could result in birth defects , causing them to live with the fear their son could develop resulting health issues later in life . coons gave birth to a premature baby boy who had jaundice and blood - sugar problems , according to court documents . <PARA> coons and ruiz are suing for $ 765 , 000 in compensatory damages for alleged negligence and breach of contract , according to court documents . we reached out to planned parenthood for comment and have not received a response , but a spokesperson for the organization told the albuquerque journal they could not comment on pending litigation or discuss specific patients due to privacy concerns .",

19 misinformation . read the latest fact checks about the vaccines . submit any questionable <MASK> and \u201c advice \u201d you encounter . become a founding member to help us hire more fact - checkers . and , please , follow the cdc or who for guidance on protecting your community from the disease . <PARA> fears of another covid - 19 surge grew around the 2020 christmas and new year \u2019 s holidays , as more people started traveling to see their loved ones . a similar surge occurred around thanksgiving when numerous people traveled , got sick , and filled hospitals . much of this surge resulted in public health officials cautioning people that it was not safe to travel or attend gatherings just because they had received a negative covid - 19 test result . <PARA> the holiday - related covid surge even prompted wil gibb , an emergency medicine doctor at stanford , to tweet a recommendation . in response to another doctor who described how just days after receiving a negative covid test result , a patient began to have respiratory symptoms , gibb tweeted : <PARA> we learned that getting a negative test does not mean that individuals are entirely \u201c clear \u201d to gather or travel . doctors have pointed out that even if everyone who attends a gathering gets a covid - 19 negative test in advance , nothing is ever risk - free . <PARA> paige larkin , a clinical microbiologist at northshore university healthsystem in chicago , told the new york times that , \u201c a negative result is a snapshot in time . it \u2019 s telling you that , at that exact second you are tested , the virus was not detected . it does not mean you \u2019 re not infected .\u201d <PARA> los angeles county public health director barbara ferrer said , \u201c by the time you get a negative test result , you may no longer be negative . and even if you have no symptoms , you can easily infect others .\u201d <PARA> people who test negative could still have the virus . the virus takes time \u2014 usually several days \u2014 to build up in a person \u2019 s body , so getting a test at any point also does not guarantee the virus will be fully detectable . it is possible that right before or after getting a test , people can spread the virus . <PARA> even with testing , there is still a possibility of getting a <MASK> negative result . according to one study in the annals of internal medicine , even after nine days of infection , an individual still had a 21 % chance of receiving a <MASK> negative result ( the first day of symptoms presented a 38 % chance of a <MASK> negative result ). different tests also have different success rates . the p . c . r test normally can detect the virus when it is present at low levels , but takes a few days to yield results , which means one is at risk of exposure during the time after the test . antigen tests are faster with results and more convenient , but can also miss the virus when it is less prevalent in a person \u2019 s body . <PARA> furthermore , relying on testing alone to determine whether it is safe to gather affords people a <MASK> sense of security . health experts recommend testing , quarantining for two weeks , wearing masks , and social distancing at gatherings to reduce the risk of spreading even more . <PARA> experts generally agree that relying solely on testing is not enough to \u201c clear \u201d a person for gatherings . in an informal survey of more than 600 epidemiologists by the new york times , just 6 % said that if they recently tested negative for the virus , they would be comfortable spending time indoors with others without precautions . some 29 % said they would do so if everyone also used masks and practiced social distancing . and 64 % said that even if they tested negative , they would not be comfortable spending time indoors with people they didn \u2019 t already live with . <PARA> u . s . <MASK> also have different rules surrounding travel and whether a negative test is enough to clear someone for travel between <MASK> . some <MASK> like new jersey expect travelers from specific <MASK> to voluntarily quarantine for 14 days , while new mexico requires it from travelers from high - risk <MASK> . there are even more varying rules for gatherings across different <MASK> . new york , for example , restricts all gatherings at private residences to 10 people and still requires masking for individuals in settings where they cannot maintain a 6 - foot distance from others . arkansas has a similar restriction of 10 - person gatherings with the exception of workplaces , places of worship , and certain outdoor spaces . negative test results do not impact these gathering rules . <PARA> though a negative result does reduce some risk , health experts agree that it does not guarantee one is entirely \u201c clear \u201d for gatherings . <MASK> have a range of restrictions that recommend either negative results before travel , requiring or requesting quarantining , and limiting gatherings , but all these rules do not change the relative risks described by scientific experts . since there is very little chance of one being entirely \u201c clear \u201d without a range of precautions , we rate this <MASK> as \u201c mostly <MASK> .\u201d",

        "text": "in the summer of 2020 , snopes readers inquired about the accuracy of widely circulated facebook posts that <MASK> some ingredients in common sunscreens can be absorbed into the bloodstream and pose neurological threats to children . one <MASK> in particular was shared thousands of times . that post by a florida mother alleged that chemicals in her infant daughter \u2019 s sunscreen may have been connected to \u201c weird episodes \u201d of \u201c zoning out \u201d and \u201c dropping [ of ] her head ,\u201d which could have led to petit mal seizures , a temporary and sudden loss of consciousness also known as absence seizures . <PARA> some elements of this <MASK> are <MASK> , while other points are either unproven or misleading . research has indicated that active ingredients found in sunscreen can be absorbed into the body \u2019 s bloodstream after application . however , the neurological effects of these ingredients remain poorly understood and understudied . <PARA> according to the american academy of dermatology association , consumers can choose from two types of sunscreen : chemical sunscreens that work like a sponge to absorb the sun \u2019 s rays , and physical sunscreens that act as a shield for the skin . physical or mineral sunscreens generally consist of titanium dioxide and zinc oxide , both of which are known for their chalky appearance when applied to the skin . chemical sunscreens , on the other hand , typically contain the chemicals oxybenzone , avobenzone , octisalate , octocrylene , homosalate , and octinoxate that reduce the white , pasty appearance . <PARA> in the united <MASK> , sunscreen is classified as an over - the - counter ( otc ) drug and is monitored and enforced by the u . s . food and drug administration ( fda ). by and large , most sunscreen products were approved before the modern , governmental standardization of drug evaluation and approval processes , requiring that drug manufacturers prove the safety and efficacy of their own products . as such , sunscreens have not been subject to rigorous drug safety testing , according to a 2014 panel held by the fda center for drug evaluation and research . <PARA> <MASK> that sunscreen can be absorbed into the body was first presented in 1997 , and subsequent research has further indicated this to be <MASK> . a study published in 2008 in coordination with the national health and nutrition examination survey \u2014 an ongoing nationwide survey to collect data on the health of americans \u2014 found that 97 % of urine samples collected as part of a national health survey contained the sunscreen ingredient oxybenzone . <PARA> the 2020 social media posts came five years after a class - action lawsuit was filed against babyganics , a skincare company that was sued for allegedly misrepresenting some of its baby products , including sunscreen , as \u201c natural \u201d and having a misleading ingredient list . according to truth <MORE> which found four active ingredients ( avobenzone , oxybenzone , octocrylene , and ecamsule ) were absorbed through the skin and into the body when sunscreen was used at its maximum dosage . <PARA> a jama editorial in response to the 2019 study co - written by dr . robert califf and dr . kanade shinkai noted that while systemic absorption was considered \u201c well above the fda guidelines ,\u201d that didn \u2019 t necessarily mean sunscreen was unsafe . however , it does \u201c raise many important questions about sunscreen \u201d and the processes for its evaluation and approval , particularly when weighing the benefits against the risks in children . <PARA> \u201d ... the fact that an ingredient is absorbed through the skin and into the body does not mean that the ingredient is unsafe , nor does the fda seeking further information indicate such . rather , this finding calls for further industry testing to determine the safety and effect of systemic exposure of sunscreen ingredients , especially with chronic use ,\u201d said dr . janet woodcock , director of the fda \u2019 s center for drug evaluation and research , in a <MASK> . <PARA> in short , the fda still contends that \u201c absorption does not equal risk ,\u201d and the proposed rule is meant to provide \u201c additional safety studies to fill in the current data gaps for these ingredients .\u201d <PARA> generally speaking , no <MASK> exists to suggest that current doses of ingredients found in common sunscreens are \u201c neurotoxic \u201d or result in epilepsy . however , a 2017 review published in the journal toxicology reports found that some adverse neurotoxic effects of chemicals used in sunscreen may occur \u201c at concentrations substantially higher than those observed in environment and human tissues ,\u201d which could offer insight into such conditions in sensitive populations and potentially lend further insight into dosage recommendations . in particular , the review found potential neurotoxic effects of ingredients in both chemical and physical sunscreens , including octocrylene , zinc oxide , and titanium dioxide \u2014 three chemicals reported in the babyganics ingredients list , noted the monthly publication practical dermatology . <PARA> the research published in toxicology reports found potential links between common sunscreen ingredients and endocrinological issues , impairment of gene expression and regulation , and reproductive issues , among others . it is important to note that many of the studies included in the review analyzed the implications of environmental exposure to the chemicals in large doses on animals , both in controlled and uncontrolled environments , and did not necessarily look at the impact directly on humans at chemical levels seen in sunscreen . snopes contacted the american neurological association for further clarification and will update the <MASK> accordingly . <PARA> while the fda continues to review the short - and long - term effects of certain sunscreen ingredients , experts recommend continuing to use sunscreen and other sun - protective measures .",

( 5 % versus 2 . 9 %). <PARA> it \u2019 s <MASK> that , according to the iea \u2019 s february 2020 report , the u . s . achieved a greater absolute reduction in co2 emissions than any other country , in 2019 . however , <MASK> that the u . s . therefore \u201c led the entire world \u201d or was a \u201c global leader \u201d in co2 emissions were belied by the fact that other countries ( including germany , japan , and likely others ) achieved a superior rate of reduction in co2 emissions . although not a country , the european union achieved both a larger absolute reduction and a greater rate of reduction in co2 emissions than the us did . <PARA> as such , we \u2019 re issuing a rating of \u201c mixture .\u201d",

minute address emphasizing his administration \u2019 s appreciation for law enforcement , calls to tighten the country \u2019 s borders , and intolerance for u . s . gang violence , specifically among members of the los angeles - based mara salvatrucha , or ms - 13 , gang . of ice agents combating such crimes , trump said : \u201c they \u2019 re rough . i don \u2019 t want to be \u2014 say it because they \u2019 ll say that \u2019 s not politically correct . <MORE> it \u2019 s the difference between police intentionally shoving someone \u2019 s head onto the roof of a squad car or instead guiding them into the vehicle in a way that could cause injury . <PARA> additionally , trump did not explicitly say police should \u201c rough people up more \u201d during arrests , even though he did use the word \u201c rough \u201d several times in the speech to suggest what he envisions as an ideal law enforcement officer or detainment . <PARA> after the remark , amid applause and cheers from the crowd , trump turned around to address the first row of law enforcement officers behind him at the podium \u2014 some of whom were smiling . <PARA> the comments were controversial at the time , not just after floyd \u2019 s death in 2020 . civil and human rights activists immediately condemned their interpretation of the president \u2019 s remarks and the nonchalant way in which he described a scenario that could result in suspect injuries in police custody . vanita gupta , president of the leadership conference on civil and human rights , said in a <MASK> : <PARA> that backlash in 2017 also included criticism from u . s . police leaders and organizations that represent them . the chief of the houston police department , for example , tweeted : \u201c to be clear , inappropriate attempt at gallows humor does not reflect values of respect & commitment to constitutional policing of the profession .\u201d <PARA> to conclude our examination , we looked at existing federal <MASK> and case law that aim to protect the civil rights of all americans in police custody , no matter what crime police think they committed , and that aim to prevent cops from using \u201c more force than is reasonably necessary to arrest or gain control of the victim ,\u201d as the u . s . department of justice says on its website . if trump had told police to \u201c rough people up more \u201d during arrests , like the <MASK> asserts , without explaining under what circumstances he would like that type of excessive force used , he would have essentially been encouraging law - enforcement to break the federal law in cases where force wasn \u2019 t \u201c reasonably necessary .\u201d <PARA> in sum , while trump did say in july 2017 that he would like to see \u201c thugs being thrown into the back of a paddy wagon \u201d and for officers not to \u201c be too nice \u201d with people in custody , and while he encouraged police to stop one procedure that aims to prevent injuries to civilians , we rate this <MASK> as \u201c mixture .\u201d he did not explicitly tell police to \u201c rough people up more \u201d or to not worry about injuring suspects during arrests , though his comments could be interpreted as support for measures that could result in civilian injuries in police custody .",

( which makes perfect sense when you think about it : if you were a pickpocket or mugger , wouldn \u2019 t you be inspired to hang about relatively unsupervised outdoor locations where potential victims go to load themselves up with cash ?) it therefore pays to stay alert to one \u2019 s surroundings when using these <PARA> machines . <PARA> there are precautions folks can take to lessen their chances of being victimized when using atm or cashpoint machines . while some work to protect users from having their financial information stolen and others to lessen the chances of being mugged at the machines , they all bear taking to heart :",

        "text": "one of the constitutional powers of the president of the united <MASK> is to nominate and appoint judges of the supreme court , with the qualification that such appointments be undertaken with the \u201c advice and consent of the senate .\u201d this procedure \u2014 like many others crafted by founding fathers who did not anticipate the rise of political parties in america \u2014 has long since become enmeshed in partisan posturing . whichever party holds the white house typically seeks to elevate a supreme court nominee who is ideologically aligned with their party , employing varying strategies to push their chosen nominee through the approval process depending upon whether they , the opposition , or neither party controls the senate . <PARA> one uncommon ( but not unprecedented ) circumstance presaging a supreme court battle occurred when supreme court justice antonin scalia unexpectedly passed away on 13 february 2016 , leaving president barack obama to nominate a replacement . ( although supreme court justices are appointed for life , over the last several decades most court vacancies have been created through the retirement or resignation of sitting justices rather than death , thereby providing presidents with ample time to consider and nominate their replacements .) since at the time of antonin scalia \u2019 s death , president obama had less than a year remaining in his final office while the republicans held a majority of seats in the u . s . senate , the gop served notice that they could simply delay confirmation of whomever president obama nominated replace to scalia until after the upcoming presidential election in the hopes that they might regain the white house and then put forth their own nominee instead . <PARA> this chain of events , naturally , prompted criticisms about one side \u2019 s \u201c playing games \u201d with the supreme court confirmation process and the other side \u2019 s engaging in hypocrisy for objecting to something they themselves had advocated on previous occasions . this rhetorical battle was reflected in various images circulated by social media that portrayed members of both parties as opportunistic flip - floppers who justified whichever approach suited their side at the time . <PARA> one such image featured <MASK> from mitch mcconnell , the senate majority leader ( and a republican ), advocating ( in 2016 ) that scalia \u2019 s seat remain open until after the next presidential election , while <MASK> ( in 2001 ) that the president \u201c is entitled to tilt the judiciary in the direction that he feels appropriate \u201d: <PARA> verifying the accuracy and meaning of the first <MASK> is fairly straightforward : on 13 february 2016 ( the day scalia died ), mcconnell \u2019 s words were widely reported <PARA> the second <MASK> stemmed from hearings held in 2001 by a congressional subcommittee on administrative oversight and the courts regarding the judicial nomination and confirmation process ( for all federal judicial appointments , not just supreme court justices ), hearings that \u201c focused on the vital question of what role ideology should play in the selection and confirmation of judges .\u201d <PARA> senator mcconnell , as a member of the committee on the judiciary , averred ( in part ) that the role of the senate should largely be to examine \u201c the competence and the integrity and the fitness of a judge to be on the bench \u201d rather than a nominee \u2019 s political ideology , that the senate should \u201c defer to the president on the question of ideology ,\u201d that the president is \u201c entitled for the most part to tilt the judiciary in the direction that he feels appropriate ,\u201d and that he ( i . e ., mcconnell ) had accordingly approved every one of judicial nominees put forth by president bill clinton ( a democrat ): <PARA> mcconnell concurred with a previous <MASK> offered by jon kyl , a republican senator from arizona , who said ( in part ): <PARA> another image featured similar \u201c flip - flopping \u201d <MASK> from senator harry reid of nevada , a democrat who previously served as senate majority leader : <PARA> as with the mcconnell image , the <MASK> attributed to reid were contradictory and presumably based on whatever course of action might be politically expedient for his party rather than on a consistent ( non - partisan ) political position . the provenance of these <MASK> was also not difficult to ascertain : on 1 march 2016 , reid was <MASK> as follows in an <MASK> about republican opposition to holding nomination hearings for scalia \u2019 s replacement prior to the end of president obama \u2019 s term : <PARA> ( technically , the constitution simply <MASK> that the president \u201c shall nominate , and by and with the advice and consent of the senate , shall appoint ... judges of the supreme court \u201d; that document is silent on whether the senate is obligated to hold hearings and vote on such nominations .) <PARA> <MASK> of sen . reid \u2019 s 2005 <MASK> was equally easy to come by : during a 19 may 2005 senate session convened in consideration of the appointment of priscilla owen as a judge for the fifth circuit u . s . court of appeals ( which had , among other similar nominations , been blocked by filibustering democrats ): <PARA> during those proceedings , senator reid maintained the wording of the constitution did not require that \u201c every nominee receive a vote \u201d: <PARA> a minor quibble could be made about reid \u2019 s speaking of judicial \u201c nominees \u201d and not supreme court \u201c appointees ,\u201d but that difference seemingly had little bearing on the overall thrust of his <MASK> .",

year investigation into planned parenthood \u2019 s practice of selling aborted fetus parts and captured a conversation that took place in july 2014 in which dr . nucatola discussed how organs were preserved during the abortion process with an eye towards later sale : <PARA> it \u2019 s unclear why the video was held for over a year before it was released , and it has some curious aspects to it . for starters , it opens with a news report and footage of planned parenthood president gloria feldt condemning \u201c inappropriate behavior ,\u201d presented in a manner that made feldt \u2019 s <MASK> seem like she was commenting on the current issue even though the <MASK> was actually more than a decade old . <PARA> when planned parenthood faced similar accusations in 2003 , feldt , who was president of the organization from 1996 to 2005 ( and not at any time during the alleged three -

        "text": "in late 2019 , we received multiple inquiries from readers about the veracity of a viral facebook post that presented an account of the actor jimmy stewart \u2019 s military service during world war ii . <PARA> the post <MASK> a profound link between the trauma stewart suffered from flying 20 combat missions over germany and his ability to immerse himself in the role of george bailey , the melancholic protagonist of the classic american film ( and holiday favorite ) \u201c it \u2019 s a wonderful life .\u201d <PARA> on dec . 22 , 2018 , ned forney \u2014 a writer who devotes his facebook page to personal histories and tributes to many u . s . military service members \u2014 posted one such account of stewart \u2019 s patriotism and dedication , and the emotional scars he bore from his sacrifice : <PARA> it \u2019 s a stirring account , and one firmly rooted in an accurate presentation of the basic sequence of events of stewart \u2019 s involvement in world war ii . however , elements of the <MASK> \u2014 the <MASK> that stewart was removed from flying missions over germany because he suffered from ptsd , and descriptions of him suffering nightmares of \u201c men falling through the air screaming \u201d \u2014 appear to be rather thinly sourced and not corroborated in other accounts of the actor \u2019 s military service . <PARA> the version of events presented in the meme appears to have borrowed heavily from a 2016 book by the nonfiction writer robert matzen , called \u201c mission : jimmy stewart and the fight for europe .\u201d the book charted stewart \u2019 s early career as an actor , his friendships and relationships , his family \u2019 s <MASK> of military service , his famously close and affectionate bond with his father , and his entry into military service during world war ii . <PARA> however , the book attracted attention in the media for the revelatory <MASK> that stewart had suffered from what would now be diagnosed as ptsd , as a result of the horrors of flying 20 bombing missions over germany , to such an extent that stewart had to withdraw from combat missions , and that his trauma was visible to those on the set of \u201c it \u2019 s a wonderful life .\u201d <PARA> here \u2019 s what matzen wrote in the book itself about stewart \u2019 s <MASK> of mind after returning to hollywood from the war : <PARA> on several occasions throughout the book , matzen described stewart as \u201c flak happy ,\u201d a world war ii - era phrase for symptoms of anxiety , sleeplessness , nightmares , and so on , which would now likely be diagnosed as ptsd . in one instance , he cited an interview he conducted with lt . barry shillito , a fellow pilot and contemporary of stewart \u2019 s , as follows : <PARA> \u201c... shillito was shocked at <MORE> that col . bob terrill , with whom stewart had a close affinity , might have lobbied for the transfer , but otherwise describes it as \u201c a routine air force change of assignment ,\u201d adding : <PARA> \u201c stewart was a mature , knowledgeable and experienced air force officer with an operational and administrative background . and a stellar combat record . he knew the territory . in short , he was ready for promotion . and deserved it .\u201d <PARA> matzen \u2019 s depiction of stewart \u2019 s <MASK> of mind as \u201c flak happy \u201d towards the end of world war ii ( a depiction reflected in forney \u2019 s viral facebook post ) was relatively thinly sourced , and involved only one direct <MASK> from a person who met the actor at that time . <PARA> by contrast , two other detailed accounts of stewart \u2019 s world war ii service make no mention of his having suffered symptoms equivalent to ptsd , nor <MASK> that such symptoms were the cause of his being gradually withdrawn from combat missions as the fighting reached its conclusion . one of those accounts was written by an air force intelligence officer who worked side - by - side with stewart between the spring of 1944 and the end of the war . <PARA> however , we don \u2019 t have definitive <MASK> in either direction . since \u201c flak happy \u201d is an inherently rather fuzzy description of symptoms , rather than a specific clinical diagnosis , it \u2019 s perfectly plausible that shillito might have seen in stewart \u2019 s demeanor clear signs of the condition ( an appraisal he passed on to matzen ) whereas others who encountered him might have come to a completely different conclusion , either due to their own subjective point of view , or because stewart acted differently around them . <PARA> there \u2019 s little doubt that much of the account presented in forney \u2019 s viral facebook post was accurate . stewart pushed back against bureaucratic delays and hesitation among military leadership and persistently requested to be allowed to play a more active role in the war effort , rather than being a mere \u201c poster boy .\u201d while <MASK> in england , he flew and led 20 combat missions over germany , and received promotions and commendations , in particular for his leadership of those around him . naturally , he keenly felt any loss of life and later described the fear he routinely felt when embarking on bombing missions . <PARA> however , the available <MASK> is indecisive on the question of whether stewart was so acutely affected by the horrors of world war ii that he suffered nightmares , anxiety , and traumatic memories that would , today , amount to a diagnosis of ptsd . and the available <MASK> points against any such condition being the reason that he was gradually withdrawn from combat missions .",

        "text": "across the united <MASK> , protests took place through may and june 2020 against the deaths of black people at the hands of police , spurred by the death of george floyd , an unarmed black man in minneapolis . law enforcement agencies have increasingly relied on the use of tear gas as a method of controlling protesters and crowds . authorities , for instance , used tear gas in washington , d . c ., to clear protesters from the area of a church that u . s . president donald trump walked to for a photo opportunity . <PARA> snopes readers have asked us whether tear gas is banned for use in warfare . tear gas \u2014 deemed a \u201c riot control agent \u201d according to the u . s . centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) \u2014 is indeed banned by the 1997 international chemical weapons convention ( cwc ) for use by nation <MASK> in warfare . the cwc , to which the u . s . is a signatory , uses the phrase \u201c riot control agents \u201d in its text . according to <MASK> 1 , \u201c general obligations ,\u201d the law <MASK> that , \u201c each <MASK> party undertakes not to use riot control agents as a method of warfare .\u201d <PARA> however , the law does not stop domestic law enforcement officers in individual nations from using tear gas as a method of riot control on streets and in other spaces in their respective countries . the law <MASK> : <PARA> the logic behind the distinction , according to one report , is that once riot control agents were used as a weapon by nations in war , the fight could escalate to include more dangerous chemical weapons , like nerve gas . the american civil liberties union ( aclu ) has called this decision \u201c controversial \u201d and cited numerous examples in which the organization says u . s . law enforcement officers have used tear gas both excessively and indiscriminately in protests . <PARA> some background on the cwc : the u . s . ratified it in 1993 , but it didn \u2019 t go into effect until 1997 . according to encyclopaedia britannica , tear gas was first used in world war i for chemical warfare , but because its effects were short - lasting , domestic law enforcement authorities began to use it to disperse mobs and rioters . <PARA> \u201c riot control agents \u201d are defined in the convention as , \u201c any chemical not listed in a schedule , which can produce rapidly in humans sensory irritation or disabling physical effects which disappear within a short time following termination of exposure .\u201d <PARA> tear gas has a number of effects on people , according to the cdc , including causing extreme irritation to the area of contact for a period of time ( usually 15 to 30 minutes ). also : <PARA> long - lasting exposure or exposure to a large dose of a riot control agent , or tear gas , can have the following effects , according to the cdc : <PARA> in june 2020 , a number of cities in the u . s . proposed bans , or moratoriums , on tear gas use as a method of crowd dispersal by law enforcement , amidst fears that the chemical irritants used in the gas will make bodies more vulnerable to the covid - 19 coronavirus disease . as noted above , tear gas can cause long - term harm , including making people more susceptible to pneumonia , influenza , and other illnesses . <PARA> in sum , the use of tear gas , deemed a \u201c riot control agent \u201d by national and international health agencies , is banned in warfare by the international chemical weapons convention but not for domestic riot control purposes . we therefore rate this <MASK> \u201c <MASK> .\u201d",

        "text": "<MASK> : during the reign of charles ii , who ruled in great britain and ireland during the restoration period ( 1660 - 85 ) after returning from nine years \u2019 exile in france , a small committee of the privy council , also known as the committee for foreign affairs ( the forerunner of the modern cabinet ), had chief management of the course of government from 1667 to 1673 . this council included the following five men : thomas clifford , 1st baron of chudleigh and lord treasurer ; henry bennet , 1st earl of arlington and secretary of <MASK> ; george villiers , <PARA> 2nd duke of buckingham ; anthony ashley cooper , 1st earl of shaftesbury and lord chancellor ; and john maitland , first duke of lauderdale and charles \u2019 s principal administrator in scotland . <PARA> when some of the policies of these ministers proved unpopular ( particularly their signing of the 1672 treaty of alliance with france , a catholic nation , for war against holland , a protestant nation ), this ministry was dubbed a cabal , with the negative connotations the word now carries : a junto or council of intriguers united to bring about an overturn or usurpation , particularly in public affairs . sometime later the belief arose that cabal was not merely an existing word <PARA> which had been applied to a group charles \u2019 ministers , but that the word itself was actually derived from the initial letters of these five men \u2019 s names : clifford , <PARA> arlington , buckingham , ashley , and lauderdale . <PARA> the acronymic <MASK> was merely a fanciful explanation cooked up long after the fact , however . according to the oxford english dictionary , cabal was first applied to this particular group of five ministers in a 1673 pamphlet entitled \u201c england \u2019 s appeal from the private cabal at white - hall to the great council of the nation .. . by a <MASK> lover of his country ,\u201d and although the use of cabal to refer to charles \u2019 ministers may have popularized the word , it is documented as having been used in english in the same sense well before charles ii took the throne . (\u201c cabal \u201d comes from the hebrew cabala ( or qabbalah , literally \u201c receiving \u201d or \u201c acceptance \u201d), a medieval jewish mystical tradition , and french cabale , \u201c an intriguing faction .\u201d) moreover , the word cabal doesn \u2019 t really fit the situation historically , either , since the committee for foreign affairs was composed of more than just the five men named here , and even those five did not necessarily always agree on matters of policy . as well , an excerpt from a 1670 bit of andrew marvell \u2019 s writing demonstrates that more than one \u201c cabal \u201d was said to exist within charles \u2019 ministries , and these five men weren \u2019 t then noted as all belonging to the same one : <PARA> the governing cabal are buckingham , lauderdale , ashly , orery , and trevor . not but the other cabal [ arlington , clifford , and their party ] too have seemingly sometimes their turn .",

( update : though he was not a featured speaker , lindell did speak briefly during the roll call portion of the convention .) <PARA> third on the list is dr . stella immanuel , nicknamed \u201c the demon sperm doctor \u201d in the meme . immanuel gained notoriety after trump himself pushed her theories that face masks were not necessary to stop the spread of covid - 19 . she has also said that a range of medical issues usually occurring in women are caused by demonic sperm after having sex with demons . she is not speaking at the convention . <PARA> actor scott baio spoke at the 2016 rnc , while musician kid rock was being considered for a performance at this year \u2019 s convention before the pandemic struck in 2020 . neither appear to be on the official speaker \u2019 s list for 2020 . <PARA> finally , mark and patricia mccloskey ( dubbed \u201c the racist gun couple \u201d in the meme ) are , in fact , speaking on the first day of the rnc . the duo brandished their firearms at black lives matter protesters in st . louis in june 2020 in the wake of police custody deaths of black men that resulted in nationwide demonstrations . <PARA> only three people \u2014 including a couple \u2014 named in this meme will actually be speaking at the rnc . as such , we rate this <MASK> \u201c mostly <MASK> .\u201d",

        "text": "in october 2018 , several suspicious packages were sent to high - profile democratic party figures including former president barack obama , former presidential candidate hillary clinton , former vice president joe biden , and liberal financier george soros <PARA> law enforcement officials said the packages contained suspected explosive devices , although none of them detonated or caused any physical injury . the episode prompted widespread concern and increased political tensions in the lead - up to the 6 november midterm elections , especially after authorities in florida arrested 56 - year - old cesar sayoc , a supporter of president donald trump , in connection with the packages . <PARA> the mailings also engendered conspiracy theories , chief among them the notion that the sending of the suspicious packages , the contents of many of which had the appearance of pipe bombs , was a \u201c <MASK> flag \u201d operation , orchestrated by liberals to stoke outrage against president donald trump on account of his past violent rhetoric . <PARA> against this background , a viral meme emerged on 24 october which some promoters cited as <MASK> that the \u201c pipe bomb \u201d mailings were a politically - motivated hoax rather than a genuine effort to harm or intimidate perceived liberal democrats : <PARA> this message reappeared on multiple different facebook accounts , in many cases prompting comments which held that the pipe bombs were a hoax or news reports about the mail terror campaign were fake . the logic of this argument went as follows : <PARA> background <PARA> on 22 october , a suspected explosive device was found in a package in the mailbox outside the suburban new york home of george soros , a billionaire financier and philanthropist who is a frequent target of right - wing attacks and misinformation for his funding of liberal and progressive causes . <PARA> later , federal officials told the new york times that the package was likely hand - delivered rather than being sent through the mail . <PARA> two days later , the u . s . secret service intercepted two potential explosive devices which had been addressed to the <MASK> new york home of hillary and bill clinton , and the washington , d . c ., home of the obama family , respectively . in a <MASK> about those mailings , the secret service wrote : <PARA> while it \u2019 s <MASK> that some initial reports <MASK> that these packages had been found at or delivered to the homes , the vast majority of news <MASK> correctly stipulated that the packages had been sent to residential addresses but had been intercepted by the secret service before arrival . <PARA> so it \u2019 s worth noting that the misinformation the meme sought to point out was largely absent from news reports , which were overwhelmingly careful to point out , even in headlines , that the suspicious packages had never made it to the homes of the <MORE> , as a matter of policy , directly deliver mail addressed to secret service protectees . <PARA> we asked the agency to confirm this point , but a spokesperson told us : \u201c for operational security reasons , the secret service does not discuss specifically nor in general terms the means and methods we utilize to carry out our protective responsibilities .\u201d <PARA> likewise , a spokesperson for usps responded to our queries by writing : \u201c we are not able to address your specific questions .\u201d we also asked ups and fedex to clarify whether their employees ever directly deliver mail to secret service protectees , and a spokesperson for the former told us that \u201c ups has layered security measures , but we do not disclose them to maintain their effectiveness .\u201d we did not receive a substantive response from fedex . <PARA> on 24 october , a man who identified himself as an employee of fedex and a former employee of usps called into the roger and jp show on the florida radio <MASK> whpt ( the bone ), and his contribution to the show can be heard here ( starting around the five - minute mark ). roughly speaking , he told the hosts that the secret service always examines packages addressed to \u201c a celebrity , like barack obama or donald trump .\u201d by this it appears he meant that the secret service always examines packages addressed to someone under its protection . as we have outlined , this appears to be <MASK> . <PARA> this does not mean that reporting about the packages , in general , was <MASK> , or that the episode constituted a hoax or a \u201c <MASK> flag \u201d operation . in a press conference on 26 october , federal bureau of investigation director christopher wray emphasized that the 13 devices sent to various intended recipients were \u201c not hoax devices \u201d: <PARA> as of 26 october , suspect cesar sayoc , who frequently posted online about his support for president trump and distaste for democrats , cnn and george soros , had not given a public explanation for his alleged actions . however , no <MASK> supports the theory that the mail bomb campaign was part of a hoax or <MASK> flag conspiracy intended to stoke outrage among opponents of president trump and the republican party , to the benefit of democrats in the mideterm elections . <PARA> the viral meme which <MASK> a former usps worker has been presented on social media as <MASK> that the news media was deliberately misleading the public about the delivery of packages to the homes of the obamas and clintons , and therefore <MASK> that the entire episode constituted a \u201c <MASK> flag \u201d operation . but this was not the case , not least because the vast majority of news <MASK> accurately reported the fact that the secret service intercepted the explosive devices before they arrived at their intended destinations .",

        "text": "consider the following <MASK> about the <MASK> of the mars company \u2019 s popular milky way and 3 musketeers candy bars : <PARA> many of the items covered on our site exemplify the notion that we human beings don \u2019 t like things that don \u2019 t make sense , but we really do like interesting stories . so much so , in fact , that we \u2019 ll invent and cling to fanciful , fictitious explanations that seem more satisfying or understandable to us than mundane realities , even when the subject is as trivial as candy bars . <PARA> it \u2019 s easy to see why some people might puzzle over the name of mars \u2019 3 musketeers candy bar : the confection has no obvious connection to the literary creations of alexandre dumas ( especially now that representations of the three musketeers characters are no longer featured on the bars \u2019 wrappers ), and name isn \u2019 t reflective of any quality of the candy itself . <PARA> its sibling bar , milky way , would seem to fit the name better , consisting as it does of three primary components : chocolate - malt nougat , caramel topping , and a chocolate covering , while the 3 musketeers bar boasts but two components : fluffy chocolate nougat with a chocolate covering . hence a simple theory to explain it all \u2014 the bars are both misnamed because their wrappers were inadvertently switched when they were first introduced , and by the time the mistake was discovered it was too late for their manufacturer to feasibly switch the names back . <PARA> the obvious death knell to this explanation is that the 3 musketeers and milky way candy bars were not \u201c released on the same day ,\u201d or even in the same decade . frank c . mars introduced the milky way bar in 1923 , but his mars company didn \u2019 t begin producing 3 musketeers bars until 1932 . <PARA> the specific answer to why the 3 musketeers bar is so named has to do with the fact that it was once a considerably different type of confection . when first introduced in the 1930s , 3 musketeers was not ( as it is now ) a single chocolate bar . rather , the wrapper housed three separate bars , each with a different flavor of fluffy , milk chocolate - covered nougat : one vanilla , one chocolate , and one strawberry : <PARA> eventually the vanilla and strawberry bars were dropped and 3 musketeers became a single chocolate bar , but the name ( and symbolism ) remained : <PARA> by the way , the milky way candy bar \u2019 s name was not derived from the galaxy that is home to our solar system , as many assume . instead , the confection was formulated to replicate the taste of a malted milk shake and was therefore named after a drink of that nature popular in the 1920s . <PARA> the milky way bar was <MASK> sold in two flavors , chocolate nougat with milk chocolate coating and vanilla nougat with a dark chocolate coating , but eventually the former became the sole milky way bar and the latter was repackaged as forever yours ( more recently rebranded as milky way dark bar milky way midnight bar ).",

        "text": "in 1988 , disney imagineering was searching for a lockheed electra 12a airplane like the one seen in the 1942 film casablanca . they planned to use it as part of a casablanca tableau in the great movie ride , an attraction planned for the new disney - mgm studios theme park scheduled to open in orlando the following year . <PARA> they eventually found the type of plane they were looking for in the hands of one ed walker of hondo , texas . walker not only had an electra 12a on hand , but one that had purportedly been used in several films during the 1940s ( including tarzan \u2019 s new york adventure ) before disappearing into an obscure career that reportedly saw it used to seed clouds over texas , owned by several different flying clubs , sold to a junior college , obtained by persons who used it for \u201c criminal purposes ,\u201d and finally sold to mgm for use in a 1976 tv movie about amelia earhart , whose producers supposedly planned to blow up the plane on camera until the \u201c threat of a lawsuit \u201d ( filed by whom ?) dissuaded them from doing so . the lockheed was finally purchased by john tarsikes of devine , texas , who in turn sold it to walker , from whom disney bought it . <PARA> soon after disney acquired the plane from walker , they began trumpeting the discovery that their lockheed electra 12a wasn \u2019 t merely like the one used in casablanca ; according to its serial number ( 1204 ), it actually was the airplane used in casablanca ! there was one small problem with disney \u2019 s serendipitious <MASK> , however \u2014 no such airplane appeared in the film . <PARA> casablanca began filming just a few months after the japanese attack on pearl harbor , when military security in southern california was at its height in anticipation of another japanese attack on the aircraft manufacturing facilities and military installations found along the coast from santa barbara to san diego . location shooting by movie studios in this area was severely restricted , and filming at facilities such as airports was prohibited altogether . therefore , casablanca was shot entirely on soundstages at the warner bros . studios in burbank ; and soundstage # 1 , which was used for the film \u2019 s climactic airport scene , wasn \u2019 t large enough to accommodate a real airplane . <PARA> that final scene , in which rick blaine ( humphrey bogart ) and ilsa lund ( ingrid bergman ) say their final goodbyes as the plane to lisbon ( the one which will carry ilsa out of rick \u2019 s life forever ) warms up in the background is one of the most famous scenes in cinematic <MASK> , and this is the scene disney recreated in their great movie ride , for which they needed a real lockheed electra 12a . however , when warner bros . filmed the scene , they found their soundstage was too small to accommodate a real airplane , so the studio \u2019 s prop men constructed half - and quarter - size models of a lockheed electra 12a out of plywood and balsa . midgets garbed in jumpsuits were hired to move in and around the replica planes to camouflage their smaller - than - life scale , and the whole scene was swathed in machine - generated fog to further conceal the artificiality of the setting . ( fog certainly wasn \u2019 t added for any touch of realism , as foggy nights are a rarity in in casablanca .) <PARA> the one casablanca scene shot outside a sound stage did involve an airplane , but it wasn \u2019 t a lockheed electra 12a . major strasser \u2019 s arrival in casablanca was filmed at metropolitan airport in van nuys ( now known as van nuys airport ) on 10 july 1942 , after some of the wartime restrictions on location shooting had been loosened . however , according to richard e . osborne \u2019 s casablanca companion , the plane that carried major strasser to casablanca in that scene was a travel - air light transport plane manufactured in the late 1920s , not a lockheed . so , since disney purchased a real lockheed electra 12a , not a travel - air , and not a wooden scale model , how could they possibly have \u201c the \u201d plane actually used in the film ? the answer is , they don \u2019 t . but it created some great publicity for their new theme park to <MASK> that they did . <PARA> only the front part of the lockheed electra was eventually used for the great movie ride ; the back half appeared in both the studios backlot tour and the magic kingdom \u2019 s jungle cruise attraction . even though both disney and one of the plane \u2019 s former owners were careful to say that the lockheed electra \u201c may have been \u201d ( or \u201c probably was \u201d) the one actually used in the film , disney cast members at the disney - mgm studios theme park still identify it as the \u201c actual plane \u201d used in casablanca .",

        "text": "on 16 july 1969 , the united <MASK> of america ( through the efforts of its national aeronautics and space administration ) was poised to achieve a milestone in space exploration . that day would see the launch of the apollo 11 mission , an undertaking which would \u2014 if successful \u2014 see men set foot on a celestial body other than earth for the first time in the <MASK> of mankind , when two astronauts would land on and explore the surface of our moon . <PARA> of course , a key portion of this achievement was to be the safe return to earth of those very same astronauts , a prospect that raised a number of issues we had not confronted before . who knew what else might return to earth with the lunar explorers ? although the moon was presumed to be lifeless , we couldn \u2019 t rule out the possibility that bringing back equipment and samples from the lunar surface might also introduce hitherto unknown microorganisms or germs into our environment , potentially triggering a scenario like the one described by michael crichton \u2019 s 1969 novel the andromeda strain , in which a sample - gathering satellite returns to earth bearing deadly pathogens from space , touching off a plague that threatens to kill nearly everyone exposed to it . <PARA> to prepare for this eventuality , on the same day that apollo 11 was launched from kennedy space center , the united <MASK> adopted title 14 , section 1211 of the code of federal regulations , since known as the \u201c extra - terrestrial exposure law .\u201d the purpose of title 14 , section 1211 of the cfr was not to \u201c make it illegal for u . s . citizens to have any contact with extraterrestrials or their vehicles \u201d; the law allowed the government to prevent the possibility of biological contamination from pathogens carried to earth by men and objects returning from space by enforcing a quarantine on any people , plant or animal life , or other material that had \u201c touched directly or come within the atmospheric envelope of any other celestial body .\u201d <PARA> in other words , if you were an astronaut returning from a mission to the surface of the moon ( or any other celestial body ), the government could require you to undergo a quarantine ; if you did not travel into space yourself but had indirect \u201c extraterrestrial exposure \u201d through contact with returning astronauts , their space capsules , or any samples or other material brought back from the surface ( or atmosphere ) of another celestial body , the government could require you to undergo a quarantine . enforcement of the law was provided for by penalties calling for a fine of up to $ 5 , 000 or a term of imprisonment of up to one year for those who \u201c disregarded of the quarantine rules or regulations or without permission of the nasa quarantine officer .\u201d <PARA> note that title 14 , section 1211 did not make it \u201c illegal \u201d for \u201c u . s . citizens to have any contact with extraterrestrials or their vehicles \u201d; it simply required those who had such contact to submit to a quarantine at the request of the government . if a spaceship full of little green men landed in your back yard , you would not have been in violation of title 14 , section 1211 and subject to a fine or imprisonment merely for shaking hands with your visitors or taking a tour of their spacecraft \u2014 you would only have been subject to those penalties if you refused to comply with a subsequent government quarantine order . ( even then , the law only applied to \u201c nasa manned and unmanned space missions ,\u201d so contact with extraterrestrials who were traveled through space on their own would not have fallen under the provisions of this law .) <PARA> the \u201c extraterrestrial exposure \u201d law was removed from the cfr in 1991 , nasa having determined that it had \u201c served its purpose \u201d and was \u201c no longer in keeping with current policy .\u201d that law is therefore no longer in force .",

( the distinction often went unnoticed by viewers , as network telecasts frequently didn \u2019 t air the pre - game anthem ceremonies .) <PARA> espn commentator stephen a . smith referenced currant \u2019 s report during a segment on 14 september 2016 , adding a \u201c paid patriotism \u201d element to the mix : <PARA> the practice of \u201c paid patriotism \u201d came to light on 30 april 2015 , when sen . jeff flake ( r - az ) released a <MASK> chiding the new jersey army national guard for paying between $ 97 , 000 and $ 115 , 000 to the new york jets for a series of promotions involving military personnel . that november , flake and fellow arizona republican sen . john mccain issued a report <MASK> that the defense department had been paying for patriotic displays in football and other sports between 2011 and 2014 : <PARA> however , this report did not cover the year 2009 , so it is unclear whether nfl teams \u2019 appearing on the field for the playing of the national anthem truly began in conjunction with the \u201c paid patriotism \u201d policy . in a september 2017 piece about the anthem controversy , cnn noted that : <PARA> the league announced in may 2016 that they would refund $ 723 , 724 to taxpayers which they said \u201c may have been mistakenly applied to appreciation activities rather than recruitment efforts \u201d during the years in question .",

        "text": "in the spring of 2019 , the christian conservative website freedom project prompted concern among some readers by reporting that a public school district in california was \u201c teaching pedophilia \u201d as a sexual orientation . <PARA> on 17 april , the site published an <MASK> with the headline \u201c pedophilia being taught as \u2018 sexual orientation \u2019 in california schools .\u201d the <MASK> continued : <PARA> the report centered around a short clip showing an exchange between yates and torres , which can be viewed below : <PARA> that clip was taken from a longer video , posted to the \u201c informed parents of california \u201d facebook group . the 43 - minute video was recorded on 21 march at a public information evening for parents in the brea , california , school district , on the subject of the healthy youth act . the full video can be watched here . <PARA> california lawmakers passed the healthy youth act , as we have outlined previously , in 2015 , creating a new k - 12 , sex - education curriculum that remained in place as of april 2019 . <PARA> the law requires school districts across california to implement instruction for students related to reproductive health , sex education , personal safety , prevention of hiv and other sexually transmitted infections , child and adolescent growth , as well as programming on relationships , families , gender identity and sexual orientation . <PARA> each school district must devise its own curriculum , including specific reading materials and classroom presentations , provided the content is in keeping with the requirements of the healthy youth act , including the requirement that all instructional material must be \u201c age - appropriate .\u201d <PARA> on the subject of sexual orientation , the text of the legislation <MASK> : \u201c instruction and materials shall affirmatively recognize that people have different sexual orientations and , when discussing or providing examples of relationships and couples , shall be inclusive of same - sex relationships .\u201d the legislation does not mention pedophilia ( sexual activity between an adult and child ) or pederasty ( sexual activity between a man and a boy ). <PARA> the full 43 - minute video shows a 21 march presentation given by brea olinda unified school district ( bousd ) assistant superintendent kerrie torres , which provided attending parents with information about how the district was implementing the requirements of the healthy youth act , and what the bousd curriculum entailed . <PARA> around 25 minutes into the video , yates interrupted torres \u2019 presentation to ask about the curriculum \u2019 s component on sexual orientation , and whether parents could withdraw their children from it ( a subject we have previously examined in greater detail ). yates said : <PARA> \u201c... i \u2019 m just wondering , because you did give me this powerpoint presentation that actually goes through the <MASK> of the lgbtiq [ lesbian , gay , bisexual <MORE> any reference to pederasty . however , an earlier version contained the following bullet point : <PARA> \u201c the practice of pederasty ( an older upper class man would make a young free boy his partner and become his mentor ) is mentioned in homer \u2019 s iliad [ the ancient greek epic poem ], and is <MASK> to have existed at least 4500 years ago in ancient egypt .\u201d <PARA> in a <MASK> , a spokesperson for the school district told us that the previous reference to pederasty was removed from section 4 . 8 of the ninth - grade , health - education curriculum in the fall of 2018 . \u201c after careful review of the curriculum , the district determined it [ the bullet point ] posed more questions than answers ,\u201d the spokesperson wrote . <PARA> the description of pederasty in the <MASK> bousd presentation is accurate , and in tracing the <MASK> of same - sex relationships in various societies , it would be perfectly relevant to mention the ancient greek custom whereby older men imposed a sexual relationship on much younger males , typically teenage boys . <PARA> although modern - day observers would view such a practice as predatory , abusive and criminal , it was widely practiced and accepted in ancient greek society . as such , it would appear relevant for inclusion in a brief summary of prominent milestones and trends in lgbt <MASK> , while bearing in mind the clear distinction between same - sex relationships , as such , and child sexual abuse . yates did not make that distinction when she confronted torres for allegedly \u2018 normalizing anal sex \u2019 and \u2018 teaching pedophilia ,\u2019 suggesting a moral equivalence existed between consensual , same - sex sexual relations and child sexual abuse . <PARA> the bousd presentation , which is outdated anyway , did not endorse pederasty or present it approvingly , nor did it describe pederasty or pedophilia as a discrete sexual orientation . <PARA> similarly , bousd official torres did not <MASK> , in her videotaped exchange with yates , that pederasty was its own sexual orientation , or that bousd endorsed or approved of pederasty or pedophilia or taught students that sexual activity between men and boys was acceptable in any way . <PARA> thus freedom project author alex newman was inaccurate in <MASK> , during a widely shared facebook video , that torres had said of pedophilia \u201c this is a sexual orientation .\u201d in reality , she said no such thing . <PARA> in fact , after concerns were raised at an earlier public meeting on 21 march , torres added a slide to her presentation for that evening that explicitly <MASK> \u201c we do not teach pedophilia .\u201d <PARA> taking the foregoing facts into account , we issue a rating of \u201c <MASK> \u201d for the <MASK> that brea olinda unified school district was \u201c teaching pedophilia as a sexual orientation .\u201d",

intended , like raising money for charitable causes , and others have been downright silly , many are a masquerade for some forms of cyberbullying . <PARA> others are potentially deadly . <PARA> \u201c the benadryl challenge is something that as parents , we need to be aware of these challenges and bring attention to how to properly use these products and make sure they are not accessible to teens . those conversations need to explain the seriousness and long - lasting consequences of abusing products ,\u201d julie weber , director of the missouri poison center , told snopes in an interview . weber added that her facility saw an uptick in inquiries and online searches regarding benadryl and diphenhydramine since the challenge was first initiated online . a majority of those who participate in the challenge are thought to be teenagers and young adults . <PARA> benadryl is an over -

        "text": "on 10 may 2019 , the u . s . department of justice ( doj ) unsealed an indictment charging two men , american entertainer prakazrel \u201c pras \u201d michel and malaysian financier low taek jho ( aka \u201c jho low \u201d), with conspiring to make and conceal foreign campaign contributions in the 2012 u . s . presidential election . <PARA> u . s . law prohibits foreign nationals from contributing to federal , <MASK> , or local election campaigns . it also prohibits donors from making campaign contributions in anyone else \u2019 s name . the defendants stand accused of conspiring to do both , as well as making <MASK> <MASK> to the federal election commission ( fec ). <PARA> a doj press release enumerated the charges : <PARA> although the recipient ( s ) of the illegal contributions weren \u2019 t named in the indictment , it was clear from the context that they were campaign committees working on behalf of the re - election of president barack obama ( referred to in the document as \u201c candidate a \u201d). the object of the conspiracy , according to the doj , was \u201c to gain access to , and potential influence with , candidate a and his administration .\u201d <PARA> mainstream news media coverage of the indictment focused on the alleged conspirators and the details of their plot to defraud the obama campaign and the fec . despite the fact that no one in the campaign was implicated in the conspiracy or charged with crimes , a decidedly different narrative emerged on an assortment of right - leaning , pro - trump websites and social media accounts . an 11 may 2019 <MASK> on intellihub . com , for example , bore the headline \u201c how barack obama received $ 21 . 6m in illegally funneled foreign campaign contributions and stole the presidency .\u201d <PARA> \u201c according to reports circulating at the highest levels in washington ,\u201d the <MASK> said , \u201c former u . s . president barack h . obama \u2019 s political campaign received at least $ 21 . 6 million in illegal foreign campaign contributions during the run - up to the 2012 presidential election .\u201d <PARA> the sentence was subsequently <MASK> in an editorial published on at least a half - dozen other hyperpartisan blogs and websites with headlines <MASK> <MASK> that a \u201c media blackout \u201d was in place regarding the indictment . a significant chunk of the editorial was devoted to the text of what was described as \u201c the doj report , in full \u201d \u2014 although , in point of fact , what was referenced was only the doj press release , which distilled the 20 - page document down to just a few paragraphs . the author of the piece then posed ( and presumed to answer ) these rhetorical questions : <PARA> the same propagandistic strategy was employed by pro - trump social media users . <MORE> the actual amount funneled to the campaign totaled approximately $ 1 . 87 million : <PARA> \u201c to facilitate the excessive contributions and conceal their <MASK> source , michel paid approximately $ 865 , 000 of the money received from low to about 20 straw donors , or conduits , so that the straw donors could make donations in their names to a presidential joint fundraising committee . in addition , michel personally directed more than $ 1 million of the money received from low to an independent expenditure committee also involved in the presidential election in 2012 .\u201d ( doj press release ) <PARA> second , as we <MASK> before , nowhere in the indictment was obama or any entity involved in the campaign implicated in the conspiracy or charged with a crime . the indictment <MASK> multiple times that the defendants went to elaborate lengths to hide what they were doing , not only from the fec but from the campaign itself . committees connected with the campaign unknowingly accepted the foreign donations via a series of shell bank accounts and straw donors set up by michel and jho to disguise the <MASK> source of the funds . <PARA> page 2 of the indictment <MASK> : <PARA> \u201c the defendants concealed the scheme from the candidate , the candidate \u2019 s campaign and administration , federal regulators , and the public by secretly funneling foreign money from jho low through a series of straw donors ( also known as \u201c conduits \u201d or \u201c straw contributors \u201d) who purported to make legal campaign contributions in their own names , rather than in the names of the <MASK> source of the funds . michel concealed the conspiracy by making and causing <MASK> <MASK> to be made to the fec . \u201d <PARA> page 8 of the indictment <MASK> : <PARA> \u201c michel , company e , and the straw donors made contributions to political committees a and b in their own names , rather than the name of jho low , thus concealing the <MASK> source of the contributions . as a result , michel caused political committees a and b to make <MASK> entries in multiple campaign contribution reports submitted to the fec about the <MASK> source of the contributions . to further conceal the <MASK> source of the contributions , and to maintain his appearance as a high dollar fundraiser for candidate a , michel made <MASK> entries in a declaration he submitted to the fec <MASK> that he was the source of the contributions to political committee b .\u201d <PARA> last , the supposition that these illegal contributions enabled obama to win ( or \u201c steal \u201d) the election is absurd , considering that the campaign raised ( and spent ) roughly $ 722 million in total , of which the actual donations jho and michel managed to funnel to the committees amounted to about one - quarter of one percent ( 0 . 25 %).",

( wills <MASK> he was protesting the umpires \u2019 failure to stop the giants \u2019 groundskeepers from excessively watering down the area around first base .) in his 1994 book about the 1962 dodgers - giants pennant race , chasing october , author david plaut related ( also thirty years after the fact ) a familiar - sounding anecdote about how wills chose to protest his fine : <PARA> note how the details escalate between tellings : in the first case the disgruntled player simply plops a sack of pennies onto a secretary \u2019 s desk and slips out , then returns when summoned and obediently takes the coins away to re - roll them ; in the second case he brazenly dumps the entire bag onto the league president \u2019 s desk and demands that the president count them and issue him a receipt . <PARA> a couple of problems are evident with the latter account . first off , anyone who has ever a handled a $ 50 bag of pennies should know that it doesn \u2019 t weigh anywhere close to 80 pounds . ( it actually weighs about a third as much and can easily be carried with one hand .) secondly , if warren giles didn \u2019 t take any guff when 6 - foot - 6 - inch don drysdale tried to leave a sack of loose pennies with his secretary , he likely didn \u2019 t sit still while 5 - foot - 11 - inch maury wills dumped five thousand coins all over his desk and demanded that he count them . <PARA> a 1974 <MASK> by baseball digest columnist john kuenster antedated both these accounts with a tale about oakland a \u2019 s pitcher vida blue <MASK> that he had paid a $ 250 fine imposed by his manager all in coins , also ( just like the previous two accounts ) dumping the loose change all over the boss \u2019 s desk : <PARA> is there a <MASK> <MASK> here ? or is this a case of a well - traveled anecdote being adopted by folks whose histories were replete with fines they judged unjust and therefore always felt deserved a measure of retaliation ? people sometimes present fanciful tales they heard about from others as incidents in their own lives as a form of treppenwitz ( in this case an instance of what they should have done , not what they should have said ). we revel in such inventive revenge tales because everyone has at one time been the object of a punishment he felt he hadn \u2019 t earned .",

the problem of men \u2019 s rights organizing .\u201d <PARA> a voice for men , a website affiliated with the broader men \u2019 s rights movement , happened to secretly record the panel discussion . that audio file is available here . it clearly shows that neither guthrie nor ingle nor any other speaker made any mention whatsoever of flatulence , or any other bodily function , as a weapon of patriarchal oppression . ingle never made the remarks attributed to her in the water pipe \u2019 s post and in multiple subsequent memes . <PARA> furthermore , the <MASK> that the hashtag \u201c# fartrape ,\u201d purportedly devised by guthrie , had begun trending on twitter by december 2013 , was <MASK> . a basic twitter search clearly shows that , in fact , that hashtag only emerged in february 2014 , two months after the water pipe blog post and was often accompanied by a link to that <MASK> . <PARA> further red flags exist , underlining the bogusness of \u201c fart rape \u201d and the fabricated nature of the water pipe \u2019 s <MASK> . for example , the <MASK> offers conspicuously few details about the fictional event at which ingle supposedly set out the principle of \u201c fart rape \u201d \u2014 writing only that the discussion took place \u201c at the university of toronto meeting center .\u201d the blog post did not specify the date on which the event purportedly took place nor its title nor the names of any organizing groups or bodies . <PARA> finally , neither ingle nor guthrie nor any other feminist activists have earnestly promoted or described \u201c fart rape \u201d as an authentic feminist principle before the water pipe \u2019 s december 2013 blog post , nor since then . <PARA> taking all these facts into account , it is clear that \u201c fart rape \u201d is not an authentic feminist principle , presented or promoted by ingle , guthrie , or other feminist activists during an event at the university of toronto in 2013 . rather , a website with a demonstrable anti - feminist agenda invented the concept and <MASK> attributed fabricated <MASK> to ingle and guthrie , apparently in an effort to discredit and attack the feminist movement in general , and certain high - profile feminists in toronto , in particular .",

        "text": "in july 2020 , some social media users accused the furniture store wayfair of trafficking children . this gravely serious accusation was not based on police reports , firsthand accounts , financial records , or deep investigative reporting . rather , it was based on the fact that some items on wayfair were listed at exorbitant prices compared to other , similar items . <PARA> this <MASK> appears to have <MASK> on the \u201c conspiracy \u201d section of reddit on july 9 , 2020 . that post noted that wayfair was selling utility closets from wfx that were priced at more than $ 10 , 000 , and offered child trafficking as a possible explanation . that post , like so many other conspiracy theories , offered this notion as a mere possibility and said that it would be stomach churning \u201c if ... <MASK> .\u201d <PARA> this post led to other users combing the wayfair website in search of other oddities . one twitter user , for instance , found a set of pillows and shower curtains that were listed for $ 9 , 999 . as similar items on the website were listed for only $ 99 , this person assumed that the only logical explanation was that the higher priced item was being used to traffic children . <PARA> generally speaking , the images showing expensive cabinets and large price differentials on pillows , shower curtains , and other items on wayfair \u2019 s website are real . however , it takes quite a leap in logic to arrive at the conclusion that this is <MASK> that the store is engaged in child trafficking . <PARA> in fact , the more we pondered this <MASK> , the more nonsensical it appeared . would a large business really use their official website to allow people to purchase children online ? as these items are available to anyone with internet access , wouldn \u2019 t it be possible for someone to accidentally become involved in child trafficking ? why would a child trafficking operation use a method that would be so easy to track ? <PARA> this <MASK> is largely based on the idea that $ 10 , 000 is simply too expensive for a cabinet , and that there has to be some other explanation \u2014 child trafficking \u2014 to justify its cost . in a <MASK> to newsweek , however , wayfair noted that these were industrial grade cabinets , and that they had been accurately priced . wayfair said that they temporarily removed these items , as the accompanying descriptions did not accurately explain the reason for the price point . <PARA> wayfair told newsweek in a <MASK> : <PARA> we reached out to wayfair for more information about the expensive pillows and shower curtains , but have yet to receive a response . <PARA> as this <MASK> circulated on social media , people chimed in with additional \u201c <MASK> \u201d of wayfair \u2019 s supposedly <MORE> <MASK> that these products carried the names of children who had gone missing . one cabinet , for instance , appeared on wayfair as the \u201c anabel 5 - shelf storage unit .\u201d this , according to proponents of this theory , corresponded with an anabel wilson who had gone missing in kansas . while this may seem suspicious to those seeking a pattern , it should be noted that there were more than 400 , 000 entries for missing juveniles in the fbi \u2019 s national crime information center in 2019 . in other words , the fact that some of these product names were the same as the first names of children who had gone missing could easily be nothing more than a coincidence . <PARA> furthermore , some of the missing children cases this theory attempted to connect to wayfair have already been solved . the \u201c alyvia \u201d shelf , for example , was supposedly connected to alyvia navarro . this autistic child went missing at the age of 3 in 2013 and , unfortunately , was found dead shortly after she went missing , having drowned in a nearby pond . <PARA> on july 13 , 2020 , proponents of this theory started sharing a mugshot of a man in a wayfair shirt and <MASK> that he had recently been arrested as part of a trafficking ring . <PARA> this is a genuine photograph of fredrick walker jr . who was arrested on june 21 , 2020 , during a prostitution sting in barnesville , georgia . however , those sharing this image as \u201c <MASK> \u201d of this wayfair conspiracy theory failed to mention that this person was just one of nearly two dozen people who were arrested during this sting , that none of the other people arrested were wearing wayfair shirts , that news reports about the arrest made no mention about any connection to the store , and that there \u2019 s no <MASK> that the victims in this case were children . <PARA> the <MASK> that wayfair is trafficking children is based almost entirely on one person \u2019 s confusion over an expensive cabinet . this conspiracy theory , like so many conspiracy theories , started with a wild and unfounded assumption that would be sickening if it were actually <MASK> . as of this writing , absolutely no credible <MASK> has been offered to back up this accusation . <PARA> but the conspiracy theory did have real impact . according to a july 20 press release from polaris , its national human trafficking hotline ( 1 - 888 - 373 - 7888 ) received such an \u201c extreme volume \u201d of reports related to this <MASK> ( none of which contained information beyond what was already reported online ) that it struggled to respond to other calls from people potentially in need . the <MASK> encouraged callers to learn more about \u201c what human trafficking really looks like .\u201d",

( science - only in 2017 , all categories in 2016 ) was : <PARA> that \u2019 s more than half , by both measures , but still off of the occupy democrats \u2019 <MASK> that 12 out of 12 were immigrants . <PARA> here \u2019 s a list of every science laureate ( including economics ) affiliated with a u . s . institution at the time of their award , in 2017 , and every u . s .- based laureate of any kind , in 2016 . <PARA> we are taking \u201c immigrant \u201d to mean someone living in a country they weren \u2019 t born in and who arrived in the u . s . as an immigrant , but some of these individuals have acquired american citizenship and lived in the united <MASK> for many years . <PARA> physics <PARA> chemistry <PARA> medicine <PARA> economics <PARA> physics <PARA> chemistry <PARA> economics <PARA> literature <PARA> the question of whether economics is a science is a hotly - contested one . the royal swedish academy of sciences , which awards the annual nobel prize in \u201c economic sciences \u201d certainly appears to view it as such . <PARA> however , the 2013 prize \u2014 which saw two economists with contradictory views on financial markets both share the award \u2014 prompted a wave of debate about whether economics is really a science , with notable contributions from harvard professor raj chetty , new york times columnist ( and nobel laureate ) paul krugman and robert shiller , one of the recipients of that year \u2019 s economics prize . <PARA> setting aside this distinction , and acknowledging that the numbers provided by occupy democrats don \u2019 t quite check out , the contribution of immigrants to the united <MASK> \u2019 nobel prize tally has still been extraordinary over the years . <PARA> if we take into account all categories , going back to the year 2000 , our analysis shows that out of the 122 nobel laureates who were based in the u . s . at the time of their award , 39 were not born in the united <MASK> . that \u2019 s 32 percent . <PARA> given that the foreign - born population of the united <MASK> as a whole was 12 . 9 percent at the last census in 2010 , this suggests that foreign - born researchers and scholars have made an outsized contribution at the highest levels of american science and economics . <PARA> this trend is particularly pronounced in the natural sciences . out of the 83 physics , chemistry and medicine laureates based in the u . s . since 2000 , some 32 were born outside the united <MASK> , which is 39 percent .",

        "text": "in october 2018 , a mass shooting at a synagogue in pittsburgh , pennsylvania prompted widespread concern about anti - semitic violence and the influence of right - wing conspiracy theories as police arrested robert bowers in connection with that shooting , a man who had posted vehemently anti - semitic slurs and conspiracy theories on social media . <PARA> attention also turned to the response of president donald trump to the shooting , in which eleven people were killed at the tree of life synagogue in the squirrel hill neighborhood of pittsburgh on 27 october . later that day , president trump spoke at the annual future farmers of america ( ffa ) convention in indianapolis , indiana , and began his speech by talking about the mass shooting in pittsburgh , calling it a \u201c wicked act of mass murder \u201d and \u201c pure evil \u201d: <PARA> in the days following the shooting and president trump \u2019 s response to it , reports emerged that singer / songwriter and music producer pharrell williams had been unhappy with another aspect of trump \u2019 s appearance at the ffa convention : his alleged use of williams \u2019 song \u201c happy ,\u201d of which the hollywood reporter wrote : <PARA> for their part , slate declared in their headline that \u201c trump played \u2018 happy \u2019 at a rally hours after the pittsburgh shooting , and pharrell is not ok with it ,\u201d and <MASK> that the song was played at a rally in illinois , not indiana : <PARA> williams \u2019 letter also formed the basis of segments on the late night shows of jimmy kimmel and stephen colbert , both of whom <MASK> that trump had been responsible for the use of the song \u201c happy \u201d before his speech at the ffa convention in indianapolis : <PARA> analysis <PARA> it \u2019 s <MASK> that howard king , a high - profile entertainment lawyer who has represented hugely successful musical artists and acts including metallica and dr dre , did indeed send president trump a \u201c cease and desist \u201d letter on behalf of his client pharrell williams , accusing trump of having played the song \u201c happy \u201d at \u201c a political event in indiana .\u201d <PARA> king \u2019 s law firm sent us a copy of the letter , which read as follows : <PARA> the letter is undoubtedly authentic , and williams \u2019 demand that trump never use any of his music , on pain of legal action , is real . however , a few significant factual problems exist with the allegations contained in the letter , as well as some of the subsequent news media coverage of it . <PARA> first , neither the white house nor president trump himself was responsible for the playing of the song \u201c happy \u201d at the ffa convention on 27 october 2018 . that decision was made by the organizers of the event ( and generally the operators of a venue are the ones responsible for rights clearance and royalty payments associated with the use of music played during events held there ). <PARA> we tracked down video footage which shows that a live , instrumental version of the song \u201c happy \u201d ( not pharrell williams \u2019 own recording of it ) was played in the auditorium at the bankers life fieldhouse , around 25 minutes before president trump \u2019 s speech began . the event was streamed live on facebook by mercedes heiner , and the use of \u201c happy \u201d can be heard in the first four minutes of that video stream : <PARA> the allegation contained in williams \u2019 letter , and the subsequent news coverage highlighted above , was that either the white house or trump himself had \u201c played \u201d the song or had at least been responsible for its use . this is <MASK> : that decision was made by the organizers of the ffa convention . <PARA> second , it \u2019 s not accurate to describe trump \u2019 s ffa speech as being part of a \u201c rally \u201d or \u201c political event .\u201d he was speaking in his capacity as president of the united <MASK> at the annual national ffa convention . the event was organized by the national ffa organization and president trump was an invited guest there ; it was not a political or partisan rally . the ffa spokesperson also emphasized that point in their response to our questions . <PARA> furthermore , some confusion was evident in the reporting about where the song \u201c happy \u201d was played . slate wrote that trump had been responsible for playing the song at a \u201c campaign rally in illinois ,\u201d but this does not appear to be <MASK> . <PARA> trump did speak at a political rally in murphysboro , illinois , later on 27 october , but we could find no <MASK> that the song \u201c happy \u201d was played there despite our checking almost two hours of footage covering the period from the build - up to his speech . <PARA> a viral tweet posted by anti - gun violence activist shannon watts <MASK> <MASK> that president trump had walked on stage to the song \u201c happy .\u201d this is also <MASK> : trump walked on stage to the song \u201c god bless the u . s . a .\u201d by lee greenwood , as shown in another live facebook video recorded by a convention attendee : <PARA> this was a particularly misleading passage , because although the president did make the comments attributed to him in his interview with ingraham , absolutely no reference to the song \u201c happy \u201d had occurred during the interview up to that point . rather , president trump was offering an explanation for why he decided to go ahead with his engagements in indianapolis and illinois in the wake of the synagogue shooting :",

        "text": "on october 27 , 2016 , the results of a large - scale , global study on the safety and efficacy of an injectable , hormone - based form of birth control for men was released ahead of publication in the journal of clinical endocrinology & metabolism . <PARA> this study was the first large scale test of a specific injectable combination of hormones , but research into this form of male birth control , which slows or blocks a man \u2019 s ability to produce sperm , has been puttering along for decades . <PARA> this specific study was a phase ii trial , the middle step in the three - study process that drugs must go through to be approved . according to a press release from conrad , one of the groups that helped facilitate the study , the method was effective but came with some side effects : <PARA> according to the study , the method boasted a 96 percent success rate for the 320 men ( and their non - pregnant partners ) involved in the study , but \u201c the frequencies of mild to moderate mood disorders were relatively high .\u201d <PARA> the decision to halt the study came from the independent data safety and monitoring committee established by both conrad and the world health organization \u2019 s department of reproductive health and research , as described in the study : <PARA> this conclusion led a number of media outlets to attach a narrative to the study suggesting that the trial was cancelled because the men didn \u2019 t think the side effects were worth it , despite the fact that an international board of scientists made that call . this narrative is best summarized by cosmopolitan magazine \u2019 s choice of headline / subtitle combo to announce the news of the study : <PARA> this narrative is rooted in the undeniable gender disparity in the world of contraceptive medicine : that the only hormone - based birth control available must be taken by women , despite the fact that many of these drugs have adverse effects similar to the ones that canceled the study into male hormonal birth control . <PARA> some reports have capitalized on this clear irony to suggest that regulatory agencies such as the fda or who have a different level of tolerance for adverse effects based on gender . that assertion , in this specific case , is a challenging one to make , as the approval process that led to the adoption of female hormonal contraception ( the pill ) in the 1960s was very different beast than the approval process in place today . <PARA> the <MASK> pill was approved for use as a contraceptive in 1960 , before a sweeping 1961 overhaul of the fda \u2019 s drug approval process ( inspired by a worldwide disaster attributed to a poorly vetted drug ) led to tighter regulation of drug trials . the number of women included in the trials , as well as the length of time they were studied , has led many to criticize the pill \u2019 s <MASK> approval as hasty . the number of people included in that trial ( or in the recent male trial ), for example , would not have been enough to win its approval by today \u2019 s fda . <PARA> and , indeed , health risks associated with the pill ( most notably blood clots ) appeared in the following decades , leading drug manufacturers to lower doses and experiment with different administration schedules and mechanisms . a study published in 2016 has also pointed to potential long term effects related to mood disorders tied to long - term use of the pill . <PARA> the question of whether or not the pill , as presented to the fda in 1960 , would have been approved today is just as valid as the question of how this male contraceptive would have fared in the fda of the 1960s . unfortunately , the two studies are rooted in very different histories and scientific climates . it is also hard to compare numbers from a brief trial to those obtained over decades of studying a drug after its approval . <PARA> the final <MASK> presented in viral stories about this study is that research , because of these side effects , has been halted . in fact , researchers have not \u201c given up \u201d on research into male hormonal birth control , and scientists have hailed the work as a great breakthrough , as reported in new scientist : <PARA> because this study was a phase ii trial , its full completion would not have resulted in a new product anyway . the scientists themselves are also optimistic about the future , <MASK> in the conrad press release that future research will seek to find the right combination of hormones to provide the same results with fewer side effects : <PARA> a majority of participants in the study also expressed interest in further development of the drug , according to the researchers : <PARA> the irony that a male contraceptive trial was halted due to side effects commonly seen in female hormonal contraception was \u2014 for good reason \u2014 not lost on the internet . however , using this study as an example of male disinterest in bridging the contraceptive burden disparity between genders brushes over one of the best breakthroughs yet at dismantling that disparity .",

        "text": "in the early morning hours of 29 june 1967 , on a narrow country road near a louisiana swamp , a grey 1966 buick electra glided through the dark on its way to new orleans . the road ahead was obscured by a white haze laid down by a distant mosquito fogger which prevented the car \u2019 s driver from discerning the presence of a slow - moving tractor - trailer ahead of him . at approximately 2 : 15 a . m ., the electra slammed into that truck , then slid under it . all three adults sitting in the car \u2019 s front seat were killed instantly , but surprisingly , the three children riding in the back seat were cushioned from serious harm . dead at the scene were the driver , ronnie harrison ; actress jayne mansfield ; mansfield \u2019 s boyfriend sam brody ; and mansfield \u2019 s small dog . three of mansfield \u2019 s five children ( mariska , 3 ; zoltan , 6 ; and miklos jr ., 8 ; all fathered by her second husband , mickey hargitay ), survived the accident . <PARA> the precise nature of the injuries inflicted in this accident would not usually bear thinking about , but <MASK> about the death of one of the passengers was turned into the stuff of contemporary lore when it became \u201c common knowledge \u201d that jayne mansfield had been decapitated . it is because this belief is as widespread as it is that this topic merits study , and it is due to the nature of the <MASK> that the discussion needs to be as detailed as it does . <PARA> although mansfield \u2019 s actual mode of death was gruesome , she was not beheaded . according to the police report on the accident , \u201c the upper portion of this white female \u2019 s head was severed .\u201d her death certificate notes a \u201c crushed skull with avulsion ( forcible separation or detachment ) of cranium and brain .\u201d one thinks of a beheading as the neck \u2019 s being sliced through , causing the head to be separated from the body , but that is clearly not what happened here . scalping is perhaps a closer description of mansfield \u2019 s fate , but even that word does not accurately reflect the cranial trauma she suffered , because scalping victims at least retain an intact skull . the angel of death did not afford mansfield this luxury : her skull was cracked or sliced open , and a sizeable piece of it was carried away . <PARA> as gruesome as this mode of death was , it at least had the benefit of being quick . mansfield probably never felt what happened to her , and because of the sharply reduced visibility conditions on the road that night , she likely had only an instant of \u201c we \u2019 re going to crash !\u201d shock to cope with before the impact . <PARA> kenneth anger \u2019 s 1975 hollywood babylon contains a controversial photo of the wrecked electra which shows mansfield \u2019 s dead dog lying beside the car as well as another item that has aroused considerable dicussion , something that appears to be a clutch of human hair . debate continues as to whether what was captured in that photo was the top part of mansfield \u2019 s head , a wig she was wearing ( or carrying ) at the time of the crash , or something else entirely . <PARA> some have chosen to attribute mansfield \u2019 s early demise ( she was only 34 ) to a curse somehow connected to the international church of satan , an institution founded in 1966 by anton lavey . little is known about the <MASK> curse , but lavey is on record as saying it was worked upon her by a consort . another version has lavey laying it onto mansfield \u2019 s boyfriend sam brody , supposedly because brody was disruptive during church services and was making mansfield \u2019 s life a hell on earth . that the alleged curse also ended up taking the life of one it was meant to help is deeply ironic .",

experts say no . <PARA> \u201c there is no fair comparison ,\u201d said dr . ruth blue , secretary to the board of trustees of the thalidomide society , in an email to snopes . <PARA> while it is <MASK> that thalidomide was marketed in some countries in 1957 to treat nausea and insomnia in pregnant women , and withdrawn five years later due to malformations in newborns , thalidomide was an often daily therapeutic drug aimed at treating symptoms and not an immunization to prevent viral infections and spread . <PARA> \u201c thalidomide was developed in the late 1950s and early 1960s and was prescribed to pregnant women to ease morning sickness , anxiety , insomnia , and a host of other complaints . it had not been properly tested in already and non - pregnant women [ and ] there were troubling side effects of the drug ,\u201d blue said . \u201c vaccines are tried and tested science , they do not work the same way that thalidomide did .\u201d <PARA> furthermore , thalidomide was not approved in the u . s . until decades after the tragedy , and only after healthcare experts studied the long - term safety and efficacy effects of the therapeutic . ironically , <MORE> issued two emergency use authorizations ( eua ) for covid - 19 vaccines developed by pfizer - biontech and moderna in response to the covid - 19 pandemic . <PARA> even so , the agency noted in a dec . 18 <MASK> that a eua does not constitute approval : <PARA> as such , the fda expects vaccine distributors authorized under a eua to continue clinical trials to obtain additional safety and effectiveness information and pursue eventual approval . <PARA> ironically , the thalidomide tragedy marked a turning point in toxicity testing , prompting regulatory agencies to more closely examine systematic pharmaceutical testing for long - term safety and efficacy both in the prescribed patient and unborn fetuses . <PARA> thalidomide was not necessarily a \u201c fast - tracked \u201d drug as many of the social media posts <MASK> . the oral tablet was not trialed at the magnitude modern pharmaceuticals and therapies are tested , and its long - term safety and efficacy were not tracked in large human populations until it was too late . <PARA> like vaccinations , fda approval of a drug also requires four phases and a series of clinical trials to determine whether it is safe and effective at its prescribed use . phase 1 typically emphasizes safety and will monitor between 20 and 80 patients \u2014 a very small sample size \u2014 to determine the drug \u2019 s most frequent side effects and how the drug is metabolized and excreted . <PARA> in the second phase , researchers will test hundreds of patients in often controlled trials to determine the effectiveness with the goal of obtaining preliminary data on whether the drugs work in people with certain conditions or diseases . <PARA> following phase 2 , the fda will determine how large - scale studies will be conducted in phase 3 , at which point thousands of patients will be given the drug for data collection at a much larger scale . <PARA> approval then requires a number of steps that could take place over several months . once a drug is approved , phase 4 entails a post - marketing risk assessment that requires the fda to continue to monitor and evaluate safety updates . <PARA> standard review typically takes around 10 months whereas priority review takes around six , according to the fda . <PARA> because of these protocols , treatment protocols for thalidomide usage in 2020 are strict in determining whether a patient is pregnant at the time of taking the drug . <PARA> as of this writing , thalidomide is regulated by the system for thalidomide education and prescribing safety ( steps ) program , which aims to educate patients who receive the drug about potential risks . among other measures , women who could become pregnant must agree to undergo pregnancy testing before starting the medication , and continue to do so during the course of their therapy to prevent the risk of fetal exposure to thalidomide .",

        "text": "<MASK> : on 16 january 2015 , new york city - based british tea shop tea & sympathy published a facebook <MASK> update castigating candy giant hershey \u2019 s , alleging the company had \u201c banned \u201d imports of cadbury chocolates made in the united kingdom . in addition , the post <MASK> popular imported british chocolate items including yorkie bars and toffee crisps were \u201c banned \u201d because their names or likenesses were too similar to the american confectionaries york peppermint patties and reese \u2019 s peanut butter cups : <PARA> due to legal action by the so called chocolate maker hersheys , we can no longer import the real cadbury chocolate from england . they want us to sell their dreadful cadbury approximation but we can \u2019 t in good conscience sell you such awful chocolate when we have made our reputation on selling you the yummy real english stuff . <PARA> in addition to banning the good cadbury they have also banned yorkie bars because they <MASK> that people might confuse them with york peppermint patties ! as if ! to add insult to injury they have also banned toffee crisp because they contended that the packaging was too similar to reese \u2019 s peanut butter cups ! may we politely suggest that if you think toffee crisps look like reese \u2019 s peanut butter cups your eyesight is a much bigger problem than your chocolate bar confusion . <PARA> the post concluded by urging fans to contact the ceo of hershey \u2019 s to express their displeasure over the new restriction . on 23 january 2015 , the new york times published an <MASK> examining <MASK> of a ban on the sale of cadbury uk \u2019 s chocolates in the united <MASK> ( where they have a strong fan base , despite higher pricing than american versions ). <PARA> partially at issue is whether hershey \u2019 s can \u201c ban \u201d imports or sales of any product . while hershey \u2019 s has a lock on a lot of the united <MASK> \u2019 chocolate market , the company technically doesn \u2019 t have the authority to ban anything from the u . s . market as it is not a regulatory agency . however , hershey \u2019 s can enforce the license it has to manufacture cadbury chocolates in the u . s . and <MASK> uk - made versions of those products violate the terms of that licensing agreement . <PARA> it \u2019 s worth noting the <MASK> update above doesn \u2019 t pertain to just cadbury uk products . if the <MASK> is accurate , the company additionally argued other imported british chocolate products ( which are not licensed by hershey \u2019 s ) could unfairly confuse consumers due to their resemblance to american chocolate brands . <PARA> cited in the facebook update and times <MASK> were yorkie bars and toffee crisps and their alleged similarity to york peppermint patties and reese \u2019 s <MORE> though the color is similar ( albeit not identical ) to reese \u2019 s products . <PARA> clearly , both sides have an interest in swaying public sentiment . hershey \u2019 s stands to gain from consumers forced to purchase us - made cadbury products , and smaller shops such as tea & sympathy serve a thriving market of anglophiles , expats , and other chocolate lovers who prefer uk formulations for a number of reasons . the times reported the primary importer of affected products confirmed it would no longer be importing the following british products : <PARA> as a result of a settlement with the hershey \u2019 s company , let \u2019 s buy british imports , or l . b . b ., agreed to stop importing all cadbury \u2019 s chocolate made overseas . the company also agreed to halt imports on kitkat bars made in britain ; toffee crisps , which , because of their orange packaging , and yellow - lined brown script , too closely resemble reese \u2019 s peanut butter cups ; yorkie chocolate bars , which infringe on the york peppermint patty ; and ms . perry \u2019 s beloved maltesers . <PARA> hershey \u2019 s has been silent so far about the controversy despite vocal opposition . however , a spokesman for the company e - mailed the times about the settlement and confirmed hershey \u2019 s wished to enforce its trademarks and limit or dispute the sale of certain imported chocolate brands : <PARA> jeff beckman , a representative for hershey \u2019 s , said l . b . b . and others were importing products not intended for sale in the united <MASK> , infringing on its trademark and trade dress licensing . for example , hershey \u2019 s has a licensing agreement to manufacture cadbury \u2019 s chocolate in the united <MASK> with similar packaging used overseas , though with a different recipe . <PARA> \u201c it is important for hershey to protect its trademark rights and to prevent consumers from being confused or misled when they see a product name or product package that is confusingly similar to a hershey name or trade dress ,\u201d mr . beckman said in an email . <PARA> \u201c it is important for hershey to protect its trademark rights and to prevent consumers from being confused or misled when they see a product name or product package that is confusingly similar to a hershey name or trade dress ,\u201d mr . beckman said in an email . <PARA> so while hershey \u2019 s hasn \u2019 t \u201c banned \u201d imports of chocolate from the uk , the company has confirmed a settlement that will result in the effective discontinuation of imports of some cadbury brand chocolates and some other uk - made confectionaries . enterprising fans of british chocolate should still be able to procure their favored treats , but doing so is set to become much more difficult .",

( a mixture , we \u2019 re told , which is \u201c highly fatal .\u201d these gangs are killers \u2014 they aren \u2019 t going to mess around with any of that \u201c slightly fatal \u201d stuff .) <PARA> ( with both pay phone coin slots and pay phone buttons now reportedly being primed to deliver a lethal payload to unsuspecting users , we \u2019 re beginning to wonder if maybe the cellular phone industry isn \u2019 t behind all this scarelore . if the next <MASK> that comes down the pipe has to do with something deadly on payphone handsets , we may have something here .) <PARA> we all know the drill : a \u201c important \u201d warning message from a source who is named but might as well be anonymous , since she provides no details or contact information ( not even the name of a city ). said person <MASK> to know that this problem has \u201c arisen in the inner cities , and is now working it \u2019 s [ sic ] way to smaller towns \u201d even though this is the first anyone else has heard of it , and tells us that this nefarious trap \u201c has killed some people on the east coast \u201d although no reports of any such deaths have made the news . and as a \u201c gang initiation ritual ,\u201d this one is pretty lame . gang initiations are supposed to provide prospective members with the opportunity to prove their worthiness by demonstrating their courage and bravery . there \u2019 s nothing courageous or brave about spreading poison on payphones and waiting for hapless victims to push a few buttons and drop dead . as a gang rite , it ranks right up there with \u201c ding - dong <PARA> ditch .\u201d <PARA> ( the effectiveness of this scheme is dubious as well \u2014 if the victim didn \u2019 t come along immediately after the application of the deadly mixture , he \u2019 d probably have to have sweaty hands or hold his finger to a button for several minutes , since momentary contact with the dried product would likely have no effect . this would also be one heck of an expensive prank .) <PARA> you have to give credit to whoever cooked this one up , though \u2014 he knew all the right details to include to ensure his bit of creative writing spread far and wide : gang members , drugs , poison , dead innocent victims , and an \u201c official police source \u201d to warn us of it all . and you have to admire a message that has the chutzpah to tell you to forward it to everyone you know , even if you don \u2019 t read it first . this is a work of art in the urban legends field comparable to the creation of melissa in the pc viruses field . <PARA> the mention of strychnine and lsd was a deft touch . strychnine and lsd have long been associated with each other , through beliefs that strychnine is a by - product or contaminant resulting from the production of lsd , that some drug users add strychnine to their lsd because it produces a better experience , that drug sellers use strychnine to make lsd bond to blotter paper more efficiently , or that unscrupulous drug dealers cut costs by mixing strychnine with the lsd they sell . ( the latter item , like the <MASK> about mcdonald \u2019 s adding worm meat to their hamburgers , is implausible because it posits that an unscrupulous vendor is trying to save money by padding his product with a \u201c filler \u201d more expensive than the product itself .) <PARA> treat this one like you would a fabulous forgery : admire it as a work of art , but don \u2019 t try to pass it off as the real thing .",

        "text": "<MASK> : when one talks of going \u201c cold turkey ,\u201d such announcement is immediately grasped as meaning complete cessation of a particular activity . ( for instance , someone who gives up smoking \u201c cold turkey \u201d does so by refraining from indulging in so much as one more cigarette , as opposed to tapering off gradually .) yet for a phrase whose meaning is so widely understood , its <MASK> is anything but . <PARA> there exist a few theories about how \u201c cold turkey \u201d came to mean the abrupt and complete end to a particular behavior , but the two most common \u2014 the ones that have a bit of a <MASK> to them \u2014 fail the plausibility check . <PARA> to begin with , there \u2019 s the notion the phrase has a culinary <MASK> . cold turkey , says this theory , is a dish that can be quickly served , in that it requires no heating or other preparation , therefore the phrase stands as a metaphor for something done speedily and decisively . however , the \u201c quickly served \u201d aspect of that particular foodstuff applies to any number of other edibles , yet one <PARA> doesn \u2019 t speak of going \u201c cold salami \u201d or \u201c cold breakfast cereal ,\u201d just of going \u201c cold turkey .\u201d also , to get to the point where one has <PARA> cold turkey to serve , one first has to cook a gobbler , which is a multi - hour process . ( and yes , it is possible these days to buy sliced turkey at the deli counter , thereby obviating the need to roast a bird , but that option came into play long after the first linguistic uses of the term .) <PARA> second , there \u2019 s the suggestion that the skin of an addict enduring the pangs of withdrawal resembles that of a plucked but uncooked turkey . while that may or may not be the case , the earliest recorded uses of the phrase \u201c cold turkey \u201d had nothing to do with addicts , addiction or quitting something abruptly , therefore that explanation fails to supply a valid answer to the <MASK> of the phrase . <PARA> the earliest recorded print sighting of \u201c cold turkey \u201d dates to 1910 and is found in robert service \u2019 s the trail of \u2019 98 : \u201c once i used to gamble an \u2019 drink the limit . one morning i got up from the card - table after sitting there thirty - six hours . i \u2019 d lost five thousand dollars . i knew they \u2019 d handed me out \u201c cold turkey ,\u201d but i took my medicine .\u201d per that usage , \u201c cold turkey \u201d refers to having been cheated at cards . the \u201c cold \u201d aspect of that use continues to this day ( a deck of cards which has been stacked in such fashion that a con \u2019 s mark can \u2019 t win against it is termed a \u201c cold deck \u201d). <PARA> the phrase began to reflect a meaning of abruptly quitting an addictive substance about a decade later , as this print sighting from 1921 shows : \u201c perhaps the most pitiful figures who have appeared before dr . carleton simon ... are those who voluntarily surrender themselves . when they go before him , they [ drug addicts ] are given what is called the \u2018 cold turkey \u2019 treatment . <PARA> the most likely source for \u201c cold turkey \u201d stems from the earlier idiom \u201c talk turkey .\u201d to \u201c talk turkey \u201d ( earliest sighting 1824 ) was to speak affably , in pleasant terms . over time , that meaning shifted into one of speaking plainly and directly about a particular matter , as this 1903 sighting shows : \u201c i \u2019 m going to talk turkey with him and see if i can \u2019 t get him to mend his ways .\u201d that use continues in common parlance , in that one seeking a raise might well during a sit down with the boss say \u201c it \u2019 s time to talk turkey .\u201d <PARA> \u201c talk turkey \u201d went on to produce the variant \u201c talk cold turkey ,\u201d which meant to lay out hard facts and / or get immediately down to business , as this 1928 sighting demonstrates : \u201c she talked cold turkey about sex . \u2018 cold turkey \u2019 means plain truth in america .\u201d <PARA> \u201c cold turkey \u201d ( in the sense of ending a particular addiction ) appears therefore to be a shortening of \u201c talk cold turkey ,\u201d in that one who chooses to abruptly and decisively quit engaging in a harmful behavior isn \u2019 t merely talking cold turkey but rather living it . <PARA> barbara \u201c cold truth \u201d mikkelson",

        "text": "in the aftermath of the 1 october 2017 mass shooting in las vegas , the american public attempted to come to grips with the scale of gun violence in the united <MASK> . one oft - cited <MASK> posted in social media by \u201c the other 98 %\u201d maintained that 1 . 3 million americans had been killed in all the wars in u . s . <MASK> , while 1 . 5 million americans had been killed by firearms ( in non - military use ) since 1968 alone : <PARA> nbc news reported similar figures : <PARA> different versions of this <MASK> have been prominently offered in recent years by sources such as new york times columnist nicolas kristof in 2015 , and pbs newshour contributor and commentator mark shields in 2012 . <PARA> all these <MASK> contain casual uses of the qualifier \u201c americans \u201d in reference to gun deaths , which is somewhat confusing because not everyone who has been killed by firearms in the united <MASK> was an american citizen , and official sources for gun death <MASK> do not offer breakdowns by nationality . therefore , we assume that \u201c americans \u201d is used here for rhetorical effect , rather than as a functional <MASK> category , and deal with the total number of gun deaths occurring in the united <MASK> since 1968 . similarly , according to the historian don h . doyle , the u . s . civil war saw around 543 , 000 foreign - born ( i . e ., immigrant ) soldiers fighting on the union side alone , so a significant number of civil war deaths might have involved non - american citizen combatants , but we \u2019 ll count them all as \u201c americans .\u201d ( indeed , non - u . s . citizens have likely served and died fighting for the u . s . side in every american military conflict since the revolutionary war , but probably in much greater numbers during the civil war than any other .) <PARA> support for this <MASK> often uses sources that relate only to combatant deaths in wars and do not include civilian or other non - combatant deaths ( the latter being figures which might also include non - u . s . citizens ). one could argue that civilian deaths in wars should be included ( although estimates of these deaths are much less reliable than for fatalities among military personnel ), but we are limiting our analysis to include only combatant deaths in military conflicts . <PARA> we \u2019 ll break this analysis into two parts : the total number of deaths in the united <MASK> involving firearms since 1968 , and the number of deaths in the u . s . and among american combatants across all wars in american <MASK> . <PARA> gun deaths <PARA> the estimated total number of firearms - related deaths from 1968 - 2016 is 1 . <MORE> trust , a non - profit organisation primarily dedicated to preserving american battlefields , estimates that around 6 , 800 people died in battle during the revolutionary war , with an additional 17 , 000 deaths caused by disease , and between 8 , 000 and 12 , 000 more deaths occurring among those held as prisoners of war . the upper end of this estimate range , then , would put the total number of deaths associated with the american revolutionary war at 26 , 800 . <PARA> similarly , the civil war trust estimates that around 15 , 000 americans died during the war of 1812 , a significantly higher number than the 2 , 260 battle deaths estimated by the department of veterans affairs . <PARA> the civil war is an interesting case . based on from the work of two late 19th and early 20th century historians , the widely accepted figure for deaths in this conflict was reckoned as 618 , 222 for about a century . in 2011 , however , j . david hacker ( then of binghamton university ) published a significant upwards revision of that total , estimating that the likely death toll was between 650 , 000 and 851 , 000 . taking the mid - point in this estimate range assumes about 750 , 000 combatant deaths for the civil war . because of the enhanced <MASK> sophistication involved in hacker \u2019 s research , and what appears to be acceptance and support of his estimate among historians , we are going to use 750 , 000 as the estimated death toll among combatants in the civil war . <PARA> figures for the global war on terror are taken from the department of defense \u2019 s defense casualty analysis system and are valid as of october 2017 . <PARA> afghanistan war : <PARA> iraq war : <PARA> if we rely on the department of veterans affairs summary , while accepting j . david hacker \u2019 s 750 , 000 estimate for the civil war , the total number of deaths among american combatants in all u . s . military conflicts , using high estimates for each , is thus 1 , 481 , 862 \u2014 about 100 , 000 less than the total number of firearms - related fatalities in the u . s . between 1968 and 2016 . <PARA> so even using the higher end of available estimates for war deaths throughout american <MASK> , the grand total of those deaths is still lower than the total of firearms - related fatalities since 1968 , a period of just 49 years . although this disparity between war deaths and gun deaths is smaller than the gap <MASK> by the other 98 % ( 200 , 000 ) or nbc news ( 300 , 000 ), the imprecision of casualty estimates ( especially for the civil war era ) allows for a considerable margin of error .",

<PARA> first , to explore that question , we researched the circumstances under which the trump administration was most likely to have written the alleged document . we learned via a july 1 , 2020 , hud press release carson had recently written a proposal to amend existing guidelines that govern how federally funded homeless shelters operate , and we deemed that initiative to be the most likely source of the <MASK> \u2019 s inspiration . the press release <MASK> : <PARA> some context : housing officials under former u . s . president barack obama <MASK> established the equal access rule , which requires homeless shelters and other facilities that receive money through the hud \u2019 s office of community planning and development to give americans equal access to services , regardless of their gender identity or other characteristics . <PARA> carson \u2019 s proposal primarily targeted homeless shelters and facilities within that group that keep beds , bathrooms or other spaces separate for men and women for both emergency and longer - term stays . his measure would have given those places the legal authority to establish rules so only people whose biological sex corresponds with that of what the shelter serves would be granted access to services , no matter how people identify . <PARA> next , we obtained the memo to which the lgbtq nation headline and press release were referring : a 29 - page document on hud \u2019 s official website titled \u201c making admission or placement determinations based on sex in facilities under community planning and development housing programs .\u201d the docket was signed by carson , a former neurosurgeon whom trump appointed to lead hud in 2016 . <PARA> the in - question measure would have changed existing guidelines that , the document alleged , obama \u2019 s administration enacted in violation of administrative law and \u201c minimized local control , burdened religious organizations , manifested privacy issues , and imposed regulatory burdens .\u201d the proposal read : <PARA> at one point , the document implied that the existing equal access rule \u2014 requiring facilities nationwide to provide housing , regardless of incoming residents \u2019 gender identities \u2014 posed a danger to shelter residents ; an argument that appeared to be rooted in the unsubstantiated and transphobic <MASK> that men with nefarious intentions might pose as trans women and gain access to female facilities to stalk or harass women . however , the document did not explain how or under what circumstances hud came to that assumption , nor did it provide verifiable instances of that happening , aside from a pending lawsuit in fresno , california , that alleges a shelter there allowed such behavior . the hud proposal <MASK> : <PARA> pending whatever shelters decide for their entry policies under the proposal , the document <MASK> , staff at facilities that are designed to exclusively serve men or women would ask incoming residents their gender identities before giving them beds . in those cases , if intake workers had \u201c good faith \u201d to believe someone was presenting as male or female but that gender did not correspond with their birth sex \u2014 which is literally the definition of being transgender \u2014 and that birth sex was not served by the shelter , the staff could turn them away . <PARA> it was at that point in the docket hud wrote : <PARA> in sum , it is accurate to <MASK> that under the leadership of trump , hud issued a memo in july 2020 that outlined steps for staff at federally funded homeless shelters to determine whether or not incoming residents were transgender , and given the language \u2014 it listed masculine physical features and how to notice them , presumably in circumstances when trans women are seeking housing at female - only shelters \u2014 we rate this <MASK> \u201c <MASK> .\u201d <PARA> however , this fact was key : the measure regarding homeless shelters \u2019 entry guidelines never took hold at facilities . <PARA> federal leaders were still debating the proposal at the time of the november 2020 election . and after voters elected democratic candidate joe biden over trump , biden \u2019 s hud secretary , marcia fudge , withdrew the trump - era measure from consideration . fudge said in an april 2021 <MASK> :",

( canadian cigarettes , by contrast , are almost entirely pure tobacco , except for what \u2019 s required to help them burn evenly .) <PARA> <MASK> about menthol cigarettes tend to fall into two categories : those having to do with specific brands , and those having to do with the product in <PARA> general . <PARA> dealing first with specific brands , a common <MASK> about kool is that it \u2019 s owned by the kkk . both reynolds tobacco ( camels ) and philip morris ( marlboro ) have seen the same <MASK> applied to them . none of these companies has ties to the kkk , but <MASK> that they do continue to fall on receptive ears . in kool \u2019 s case , that brand \u2019 s choice of initial letter has bolstered speculation about a possible ku klux klan tie in the same way the red chevrons on the marlboro pack have affected perception of ownership of that product . <PARA> tobacco has always been linked to the oppression of african - americans . this association started with the importation of slaves into the united <MASK> to serve in the tobacco fields . the connection between tobacco and harm to the black man may be old but it still exerts power today . this theme constantly turns up in lore about cigarettes , often expressed in the form of <MASK> about a white supremacist group secretly controlling a lucrative cigarette company and thus enriching itself by dealing in the traditional bane of the african - <MORE> they will come to rely on it and afterwards have to continue using the product . that little detail of life isn \u2019 t in dispute , but rather than accept it , some carmex users prefer to believe the evil manufacturer secretes ground glass in the product to roughen users \u2019 lips and thus enslave them to the little jars with the yellow lids . likewise , a cyber - <MASK> that swept the internet in 1999 <MASK> evil tampon manufacturers were putting asbestos in that product to promote bleeding and thus ensure women went through more tampons per period . the common sense realization that if the government had deemed asbestos far too dangerous to have in the walls of homes , it certainly wouldn \u2019 t passively watch from the sidelines as consumers stuck the same substance inside themselves failed to occur to as many people as one would hope , and this <MASK> about asbestos flew from one inbox to another . <PARA> we \u2019 ve saved the best for last on this list of menthol <MASK> . a surprising number of young men cannot be persuaded by any means short of a bikini - clad redhead to smoke a menthol . according to what they \u2019 ve heard , menthol cigs will render them impotent . they base that mistaken belief on another <MASK> , that saltpeter is used in the product to aid in keeping the cigs lit . ( it isn \u2019 t .) similarly , in the 1960s , thailand experienced a run on a related <MASK> , that smoking menthols would shrink a fella \u2019 s winky . sales of menthols plummeted there in the wake of that whisper making the rounds . ( 90 % of smokers in thailand are male , and it looks like they were determined to keep it that way .) <PARA> there \u2019 s no reason to fear coming down with a shriveled willy after a wild night of mentholation . like the <MASK> about mountain dew , this one has nothing to it . <PARA> there is , however , a tenuous connection between male impotence and smoking in general . for decades , doctors have believed smoking can harm a man \u2019 s sexual function because it constricts blood vessels , compromising blood flow . over the years , studies have strengthened those beliefs , most recently in 1994 , when a study published in the american journal of epidemiology surveyed vietnam veterans and found that while 2 . 2 % of nonsmokers suffered persistent impotence , 3 . 7 % of current smokers did . many researchers also believe smoking may lower sperm count . <PARA> so what \u2019 s the bottom line of all this ? menthol cigarettes are no worse for your sperm than any other type . mind you , that \u2019 s not exactly heartening news . <PARA> barbara \u201c smoke on the water ( shed )\u201d mikkelson",

        "text": "haiti \u2019 s relationship with the united <MASK> and europe can most charitably be described as complicated . haiti \u2019 s earliest days were characterized by oppression and opposition : the country ( once the french colony of st . domingue ) was born from a successful slave insurgency and declared its independence in 1804 . this beginning characterized an often - antagonistic relationship between countries that profited handsomely from african slavery ( such as the united <MASK> ) and haiti . foremost among fears about haiti was that slaves would learn successful uprisings were possible . <PARA> after haiti formally declared its independence , the united <MASK> suspended all diplomatic and trade relationships with the country . while the u . s . eventually re - opened trading routes , america didn \u2019 t recognize haiti diplomatically for nearly sixty years after that . other countries followed the united <MASK> \u2019 example ( and france demanded millions of francs in reparations for its rebellion in exchange for recognizing haiti as a sovereign nation ) plunging haiti into debt and an economic depression that lasted for years , from which the country never fully recovered . <PARA> multiple invasions and economic and political tinkering followed , leaving haiti in a turmoil of political instability and corruption , economic crisis , and a ravaged infrastructure , historically one of the poorest countries in the western hemisphere , despite its fertile land and ability to grow cash crops such as sugar . <PARA> today , child labor and trafficking are endemic in haiti , particularly in the country \u2019 s manufacturing sector , which is outsourced to foreign companies ( many of them contractors for american companies , such as hanes , dockers , and fruit of the loom ). even when they are not trafficked , laborers in haiti \u2019 s garment industry earn a pittance by the standards of other countries : the minimum wage was $ 0 . 24 ( usd ) an hour for many years . <PARA> in june 2009 , the haitian parliament unanimously passed a law requiring that the minimum wage be raised to $ 0 . 61 an hour , or $ 5 a day . ( the average cost of living is estimated to be the equivalent of about $ 23 a day .) this pay raise was staunchly opposed by foreign manufacturers who had set up shop in the country , and the united <MASK> department of <MASK> and the u . s . agency for international development backed those manufacturers . after haiti \u2019 s government mandated the raise , the united <MASK> aggressively ( and successfully ) pushed haiti \u2019 s president to lower the minimum wage for garment workers to what factory owners were willing to pay : the equivalent of about $ 0 . 31 an hour ( or $ 2 . 50 per eight - hour day ). <PARA> in 2011 , wikileaks released a set of previously - secret diplomatic cables . the american publication the nation partnered with haitian news organization ha\u00efti libert\u00e9 to cover them , finding ( among other things ) how strongly the united <MASK> had opposed the minimum wage hike : <PARA> the obama administration ( and the bush administration before it ) had been closely monitoring the situation in the garment manufacturing sector for a long time . in 2006 , congress passed the hope bill ( which stood for the haitian hemispheric opportunity through partnership encouragement ) and provided duty - free entry to garments manufactured in haiti for u . s . companies . that body also passed an updated version of the bill ( hope ii ) in 2008 , which mandated a framework for labor reform in factories . according to cables released by wikileaks , it was exactly these efforts that the united <MASK> <MASK> would be jeopardized by a higher minimum wage . <PARA> so it \u2019 s <MASK> that the <MASK> department ( then led by hillary clinton as secretary of <MASK> ) strongly opposed a minimum wage increase in haiti in 2009 . however , the <MASK> department \u2019 s efforts did not occur in a political or economic vacuum , and clinton wasn \u2019 t the sole architect of efforts to quash a minimum wage hike ( as the meme suggests ). it was a concerted effort on the part of haitian elites , factory owners , free trade proponents , u . s . politicians , economists , and american companies that kept the minimum wage so low , and to lay the blame squarely at the feet of any sitting secretary of <MASK> would be an incomplete assessment , and thus inaccurate . <PARA> a law establishing a new minimum wage of $ 5 . 11 per workday ($ 0 . 64 an hour ) was finally approved in 2014 , which still fell far short of both the demanded raise by workers ( to the equivalent of $ 11 . 36 per workday , or $ 1 . 42 per hour ) and the recommended daily wage of 1 , 006 haitian gourdes , or usd $ 22 . 86 . <PARA> related <MASK> of the clintons \u2019 relationship to haiti appeared in october 2016 , this time alleging that after the haiti \u2019 s infrastructure was <MASK> by a major earthquake in 2010 , the <MASK> department steered relief contracts to personal friends of the clintons . however , while hillary clinton did recommend specific companies to help with the rebuilding process and e - mails have surfaced indicating that special attention was given to \u201c fobs \u201d (\u201c friends of bill \u201d), there \u2019 s no <MASK> that the united <MASK> government awarded contracts to any of those contenders .",

        "text": "in july 2020 , readers asked us to examine the accuracy of news <MASK> that <MASK> 20 - year - old ohio man isaiah jackson had been arrested in connection with a photograph , shared widely online , which showed a black man kneeling on a white toddler \u2019 s neck , along with the caption \u201c blm now mf .\u201d <PARA> on july 23 , the new york post published an <MASK> with the headline \u201c ohio man seen kneeling on 2 - year - old boy \u2019 s neck arrested .\u201d the <MASK> reported that : <PARA> \u201c an ohio man seen kneeling on the neck of a 2 - year - old boy on social media has been arrested , authorities said thursday . isaiah jackson , 20 , was booked into jail on a probation violation after the clark county sheriff \u2019 s office launched an investigation tuesday into the photo , which depicts a man with his knee on the back of a white child neck \u2019 s along with a caption , \u2018 blm now mf .\u2019 a second person is also seen behind the child holding the youngster \u2019 s hands behind his back .\u201d <PARA> similar <MASK> were published by the washington times and local news channels whio and wkef / wrgt . <PARA> the core <MASK> in those reports \u2014 that jackson was identified by police as the man in the photograph , and that he had been arrested in connection with it \u2014 was accurate . <PARA> when this fact check was first published in july 2020 , jackson had not been charged or convicted in relation to the incident shown in the photograph . however , since then , prosecutors in clark county , ohio , charged jackson with third - degree felony abduction , to which he pleaded guilty . in october 2020 , a judge sentenced jackson to three years of community control probation . <PARA> technically speaking , police <MASK> arrested jackson on the basis of an alleged unrelated parole violation , though they sought him out and located him during their investigation into the photograph , and jackson subsequently pleaded guilty to a third - degree felony abduction charge in relation to the actions shown in the photograph . this fact check \u2019 s rating was <MASK> \u201c mostly <MASK> ,\u201d but in light of developments that took place after the <MASK> was <MASK> published , we are changing the rating to \u201c <MASK> .\u201d <PARA> internet users began sharing the photograph on july 21 , 2020 . it appears to have <MASK> been posted to an unidentified snapchat account . the image shows a man posing for the camera while kneeling on the back of the neck of a toddler who appears to be crying and is lying face down while a second adult holds the toddler \u2019 s hands behind his back . at the bottom of the photograph , a banner caption <MORE> tinged outrage and discussion because the caption that accompanied the photograph mentioned the black lives matter ( blm ) movement , and due to the perceived racial dynamics at play ( jackson \u2019 s race was listed as \u201c black \u201d in clark county sheriff \u2019 s department records , and the toddler was widely described as being white , although we could not verify that <MASK> ). <PARA> however , it \u2019 s unknown whether the pose was intended as an earnest gesture of anti - white bias or antipathy on jackson \u2019 s part , as opposed to a distasteful attempt at humor . our examination of a facebook profile that appears to belong to jackson did not reveal further <MASK> of racial antipathy on his part . <PARA> despite a rush , from some quarters , to condemn the black lives matter movement by association with jackson , our research did not uncover <MASK> of any earnest involvement in , or even commentary on , the broader black lives matter movement , racial injustice or police brutality , on the part of jackson . <PARA> after this fact check was published , snopes obtained a copy of police reports from the clark county sheriff \u2019 s office investigation into the incident . they showed that a third party , not jackson himself , had <MASK> responsibility for posting the photograph online , and adding the \u201c blm now mf \u201d caption . <PARA> in addition , jackson told investigating officers that his actions were intended only as a joke , but acknowledged that the pose shown in the photograph was an allusion to the death of george floyd , in minneapolis , in may 2020 . in that incident , police officer derek chauvin kneeled on the back of floyd \u2019 s neck for almost nine minutes , despite the pleas of floyd and onlookers . two autopsies concluded that chauvin \u2019 s actions led to floyd \u2019 s death , which sparked renewed nationwide and international protests against police brutality and racial injustice led by the black lives matter movement . in april 2021 , a jury in hennepin county , minnesota found chauvin guilty of three charges : second - degree murder , third - degree murder , and second - degree manslaughter . <PARA> after the conclusion of the police investigation , clark county prosecutors charged jackson with third - degree felony abduction in august 2020 , citing an ohio <MASK> which <MASK> that : <PARA> in ohio , that offense carries a maximum prison sentence of up to three years . jackson pleaded guilty , and on oct . 30 , 2020 , judge douglas <MASK> sentenced him to serve 101 days in prison , as well as three years of community control probation . since jackson had already been in prison for 101 days between july and october 2020 , he was released on probation on oct . 30 , 2020 .",

explained trends : <PARA> but that data did not include the rolling average of new covid - 19 cases on a <MASK> - by - <MASK> basis \u2014 rather than nationally \u2014 which was among the strongest measurements of the country \u2019 s progress . <PARA> as lisa maragakis of johns hopkins explained , \u201c the spread of the coronavirus so far has been more like a patchwork quilt than a wave ,\u201d with the virus wreaking havoc to varying degrees in different areas at different times . <PARA> in other words , if most <MASK> had curbed the spread of covid - 19 and reduced their number of new daily cases since the start of the outbreak , while populous <MASK> did not , the nation \u2019 s moving average would not reflect the majority of the country \u2019 s progress , lending some credibility to trump \u2019 s <MASK> that most of the country was making positive steps . <PARA> that was not the case , however . less than a dozen <MASK> were tallying a downward trend of new cases per 100 , 000 people , as of late october , according to johns hopkins data . as seen in the below - displayed graphic , <MASK> in shades of orange were experiencing a surge in new cases as of late october , and <MASK> in shades of green were seeing a decline in new cases . the darker the shade , the bigger the change . <PARA> another compilation of the tracking project \u2019 s data by the washington post came to the same conclusion . the graphics below showed how the pandemic progressed in summer and fall by comparing the daily rates of new cases to each <MASK> \u2019 s peak , or its highest increase in new cases for one day . <PARA> as you can see , most <MASK> \u2019 trajectories appeared to be worsening rapidly . \u201c we see no <MASK> that any <MASK> in the current surge has reached its peak and begun to decline ,\u201d the covid tracking project tweeted on oct . 29 . <PARA> here \u2019 s the bottom line : the outbreak was far from under control \u2014 no matter what each presidential candidate <MASK> in their final pitches to voters . <PARA> \u201c we should have been way down in baseline and daily cases , and we \u2019 re not ,\u201d fauci said , while speaking with the the journal of the american medical association . <PARA> in sum , scientists as of this writing were expecting the rolling average of new covid - 19 cases to continue to climb , with no indication that they had peaked or would begin to decline . so by describing the country as \u201c rounding the turn \u201d on covid - 19 , the president was blatantly mischaracterizing actual covid -

        "text": "the use of deadly force by police officers is the subject of long - standing concern in the united <MASK> , and the internet is often the venue for debates about the causes of fatal encounters between law enforcement agents and members of the public . <PARA> in september 2018 , a meme shared on facebook pointed the finger at one cause in particular for the relatively high rate of police killings in the united <MASK> : the length of time required to become a police officer . <PARA> the meme compared the duration of police academy training and the number of police killings in recent years , in each of three nordic countries ( norway , finland , and iceland ) and the united <MASK> : <PARA> this is our overview of the accuracy of those <MASK> : <PARA> candidates become police officers in norway after completing a three - year bachelor \u2019 s degree in police studies , administered centrally by the norwegian police university college in the capital city oslo . the college \u2019 s web site describes the training as follows : <PARA> in order to be accepted into training , the applicant must meet certain requirements : must be a norwegian citizen , speak good norwegian , have a high school degree , and be physically fit and healthy . <PARA> according to multiple sources , norwegian police fatally shot four people between 2002 and 2016 . <PARA> in their 2014 annual report , the norwegian bureau for the investigation of police affairs wrote that : <PARA> a further two fatal shootings took place in 2015 and 2016 , as detailed by the english - language news website the local in november 2016 : <PARA> we did not find any <MASK> of another police killing in norway since november 2016 . <PARA> in fact , a three - year bachelor \u2019 s degree is required to become a police officer in finland . the country \u2019 s police university college (\u201c poliisiammattikorkeakoulu \u201d in finnish ) outlines the course of study on their web site : <PARA> although this particular <MASK> in the meme is not fully <MASK> , the reality ( i . e ., a three - year college degree is required , not just a two - year course ) even more strongly supports the underlying argument in the meme , that police officers in the nordic countries undergo longer training programs than their american counterparts . <PARA> a spokesperson for the national police board in finland provided us a list of nine fatalities attributed to police actions between 2000 and 2018 . however , one of those nine deaths involved a tazer , and another involved a police officer \u2019 s accidentally shooting a prison guard , so seven members of the public were killed ( all shot dead ) due to actions taken by police since 2000 in finland . <PARA> the national police board spokesperson also provided somewhat extraordinary <MORE> <PARA> the u . s . does not maintain an official national database of incidents in which police officers \u2019 actions have led to the death of civilians , so we can \u2019 t know for certain the number of people killed by police between 2001 and 2018 , as vox noted in 2015 : <PARA> however , commendable and methodologically rigorous efforts have been undertaken to create an unofficial database , notably by the fatal encounters website , which has been used as a data source in academic research . <PARA> according to the fatal encounters database , 23 , 977 deaths took place at the hands of police between 2001 and 2018 , which suggests that the figure of \u201c more than 8 , 000 \u201d may be a significant underestimation . <PARA> <!\u2013 <PARA> this reckoning is supported by another robust source , the guardian \u2018 s database of police use of deadly force for 2015 and 2016 , which tallied 1 , 146 and 1 , 093 deaths in 2015 and 2016 , respectively . those figures suggest that the meme \u2019 s tally of about 450 persons killed on average per year by police over the last 18 years is probably on the low side . <PARA> \u2013> <PARA> the factual <MASK> in the meme are mostly accurate , but the underlying implication behind the meme , that shorter training programs cause the relatively high number of police killings in the united <MASK> , is questionable . <PARA> several unmentioned factors are likely to be more relevant and prominent as causes . according to a 2015 <MASK> by the sociologist and criminal justice professor paul hirschfield , these include : the arming of police ( which is not routine in norway and iceland , though it is in finland ), a higher prevalence of guns among the general public (\u201c american police are primed to expect guns \u201d), decentralized and under - resourced police training ( although hirschfield does not mention the duration of training as a factor ), and racial biases ( whether conscious or unconscious ) among law enforcement officers . <PARA> although it \u2019 s <MASK> that the united <MASK> has a vastly higher population than any of the nordic countries mentioned in the meme , it has a much higher prevalence of police killings , even when population is taken into account . <PARA> we counted the total number of police killings in each country between 2002 and 2017 ( using fatal encounters \u2019 data for the u . s .), then adjusted for each country \u2019 s average population over the course of that 16 - year period . that method equated to 71 police killings per million people in the u . s ., over that time period ; 3 . 2 per million people in iceland ; 1 . 5 per million people in finland , and 0 . 8 police killings per million people in norway .",

        "text": "a man was driving when a traffic camera flashed . he thought his picture was taken for exceeding the speed limit , even though he knew he was not speeding . just to be sure , he went around the block and passed the same spot , driving even more slowly , but again the camera flashed . he thought this was quite funny , so he slowed down even further as he drove past the area , but the traffic camera flashed yet again . he tried a fourth time with the same result . the fifth time he was laughing when the camera flashed as he rolled past at a snail \u2019 s pace . <PARA> two weeks later , he got five traffic fine letters in the mail for driving without a seat belt . <PARA> <MASK> : this rollicking tale about misplaced assumptions began circulating on the internet in may 2009 . while it can \u2019 t be definitively disproved , for the following reasons it \u2019 s likely better regarded as a legend rather than as an account of an actual incident . <PARA> photo speed traps or \u201c snap traps \u201d ( cameras linked to speed detection devices that automatically photograph vehicles exceeding the speed limit then mail tickets to the owners of those vehicles ) react only to the speed of whatever passes before them ; they don \u2019 t analyze and react to anything else . they \u2019 re not geared to detect whether a car \u2019 s occupants are wearing seat belts ; these cameras merely record visual images of the automobiles that the speed detection apparatus feeding into them has already determined are breaking the law . <PARA> working out the rate of speed is relatively easy for these automated devices . it usually involves no more than a matter of two sets of sensors having been embedded into the road a short distance from one another ; if the second array of sensors buried in the roadbed is triggered in too short a timespan after the first , <PARA> the machine \u201c knows \u201d the car passing in front of it is exceeding the speed limit , quickly works out the rate of travel , takes a photograph , and generates a ticket . it \u2019 s purely a matter of math ; no judgment or evaluation on the part of the machine is required . <PARA> the detection of who in a car is wearing a seat belt , however , would be quite a different matter . for a snap trap of this sort to work , it would have to quickly analyze a visual image of the car \u2019 s occupants to note the absence of safety restraints . given that seat belts come in various colors , as does the clothing people wear , definitively determining that seat belts are not correctly in place would likely be well beyond any current scanning device \u2019 s <MORE> , vehicles come in various heights , so a camera correctly aimed to pick off a clear visual image of those riding in a toyota prius would be flummoxed by a hummer . <PARA> a fellow did once get himself five speeding tickets in short order from an automated speed trap , but such result was due to an ill - controlled temper , not machine malfunction . in an incident that took place in arizona in 2007 , 21 - year - old brian ward ( a catcher formerly in the atlanta braves organization ) was clocked by speed enforcement cameras five times between 24 february and 26 february of that year . each time he was traveling at least 98 mph , and on one occasion he was going as fast as 122 mph . ( indeed , on 26 february he was clocked speeding three times in three minutes .) the young man had lost money at casino arizona and sought to work out his angst by flipping off the cameras along loop 101 in scottsdale . <PARA> modern folklore encompasses other tales that involve speed traps , such as the yarn about pranksters stealing a license plate from a speed trap camera van , affixing it to their own vehicle , then repeatedly driving through the trap , thereby causing the apparatus to issue tickets to itself ; the <MASK> of the driver who mailed a picture of money in payment of his photo radar - generated speeding ticket ( the cops mailed back a picture of handcuffs ); or the tale about the clever little boys who collect tips for warning motorists about an upcoming speed trap . and of course there are always tales of cheating spouses brought to light by the contents of the photo accompanying the ticket : <PARA> [ collected via e - mail , july 2009 ] <PARA> so i heard this <MASK> from my boss . a man receives a ticket in the mail because he had been photographed running a red light in an intersection that was equipped with a red light camera , however when he saw the copy of the photo it wasn \u2019 t him ! as the <MASK> unfolds it turns out that the man driving the car was his wife \u2019 s lover ! thus a divorce ensued ; the first \u201c red light divorce .\u201d <PARA> so i heard this <MASK> from my boss . a man receives a ticket in the mail because he had been photographed running a red light in an intersection that was equipped with a red light camera , however when he saw the copy of the photo it wasn \u2019 t him ! as the <MASK> unfolds it turns out that the man driving the car was his wife \u2019 s lover ! thus a divorce ensued ; the first \u201c red light divorce .\u201d <PARA> barbara \u201c picture of ( dis ) contentment \u201d mikkelson",

        "text": "splenda is the trademarked brand name of a sucralose - based artificial sweetener which is several hundred times sweeter than ordinary table sugar ( sucrose ). according to legend , the discovery of sucralose was ( like that of another artificial sweetener , aspartame ) something of an accident that occurred by happenstance during the course of unrelated research : <PARA> after gaining approval by regulatory agencies in the u . s . and canada ( and other countries ) in the 1990s , sucralose - based splenda overtook aspartame - based equal and nutrasweet and saccharin - based sweet \u2019 n low as the leading brand in the u . s . artificial sweetener market . the advantages of sucralose over regular sugar are many : it is so sweet that it can be used in much smaller quantities than sugar , it contains no calories , it has no harmful effect on teeth , it can be safely consumed by diabetics , and it is heat - stable and therefore suitable for use in baked goods . <PARA> in the years since then , sucralose has ( like aspartame before it ) become the target of <MASK> <MASK> that it is \u201c unnatural \u201d and therefore unsafe : <PARA> such <MASK> , as uc davis professor carolyn de la pe\u00f1a noted in her <MASK> of artificial sweeteners , have been fomented in part by the sweetener industry itself despite the established safety of those products : <PARA> as is typical in internet - circulated food health warnings like the example reproduced above ( which was largely cribbed from a seventeen - year - old <MASK> <MASK> published on the questionable mercola . com web site ), all of the information it presents is inaccurate , misleading , and / or outdated . the notion that sucralose has not been subjected to a reasonable and sufficient amount of safety testing is , in particular , woefully inaccurate . <PARA> sucralose has , across the span of many years , been subjected to extensive batteries of short - term and long - term studies in both animals and humans ( more than a hundred of which were reviewed during the fda approval process for sucralose ), and none of them has demonstrated any significant risk to humans associated with the consumption of sucralose in normal amounts . a human tolerance study published in the journal food and chemical toxicology in 2000 , for example , found \u201c no indication that adverse effects on human health would occur from frequent or long - term exposure to sucralose at the maximum anticipated levels of intake \u201d: <PARA> the chapter on sucralose in the textbook artificial sweeteners also surveys the extensive body of safety testing that has been performed on sucralose , including those involving long - term exposure and doses far in excess of recommended amounts : <PARA> the most frequently cited study supposedly documenting the harmful effects of sucralose was one <MORE> \u201d is both inaccurate and relatively meaningless . the fact that the human body does not metabolize sucralose for energy is a positive : it \u2019 s what makes sucralose non - caloric and therefore ideal as an artificial sweetener . most sucralose is unabsorbed and therefore passes harmlessly through the body ; a relatively small amount (~ 15 %) of consumed sucralose is absorbed but is excreted via urination with no harmful effects : <PARA> as is also typical with internet - circulated food health warnings , the accompanying laundry list of \u201c reported symptoms \u201d should be taken with many grains of salt . self - reported adverse events are simply anecdotal raw data ; there is no certainty that the reported events were actually due to the product consumed , much less that they demonstrate a causal relationship between the product and the reported events ( especially after consumers are influenced by reading anti - sucralose reports that list what symptoms they \u2019 re \u201c supposed \u201d to be experiencing ). such determinations cannot be made until reports have been investigated , evaluated , and analyzed , and no studies have confirmed that the symptoms listed are a common reaction to sucralose . as dr . joe schwarz observed in his work on food myths and misconceptions : <PARA> there is one thing this piece did get right , although it \u2019 s both outdated and irrelevant to the issue of the safety of sucralose : the manufacturer of splenda was indeed sued ( nearly fourteen years ago ) by a competitor over their slogan \u201c made from sugar , so it tastes like sugar ,\u201d which <MASK> implied to consumers that splenda \u201c in some way actually was sugar , but with the calories stripped out \u201d: <PARA> after the lawsuit was settled , splenda debuted a new slogan : \u201c just what \u2019 s good \u2014 it \u2019 s made from sugar . it tastes like sugar . but it \u2019 s not sugar .\u201d <PARA> on 11 march 2016 , numerous news outlets reported that an italian study ( published in january 2016 ) purportedly documented a link between splenda and cancer in mice . the international food information council ( ific ), a non - profit group aimed at providing science - based <MASK> with respect to food safety , addressed the publication of the study in an <MASK> that criticized the study \u2019 s methodology and dissonant findings : <PARA> ific concluded that the \u201c safety and effectiveness of sucralose ( and other low - calorie sweeteners in foods ) is incredibly well supported ,\u201d and added that \u201c you shouldn \u2019 t hesitate to swap them into your diet \u201d in efforts to reduce caloric intake . on 11 march 2016 , splenda issues a <MASK> via their facebook page referencing the ific <MASK> and asserting the italian study \u2019 s conclusion was an outlier among dozens to the contrary :",

( the times provided information for all california members of congress , not just nunes , who was listed by the publication as 37th in wealth out of 55 legislators .) nunes reported having $ 50 , 001 invested in alpha omega winery , a family - owned napa valley - based business . <PARA> according to alpha omega spokeswoman kelly carter , the winery \u2019 s founder robin bagget invited nunes and a few other personal friends to invest in his winery in 2005 . it opened for business in 2006 . carter sent us a company <MASK> by e - mail : <PARA> the russian alcohol broker luding was listed on the winery \u2019 s web site as a distributor , but was removed . screen shots of the page were posted to social media along with the <MASK> that it proved russian ties between the winery and russian president vladimir putin : <PARA> there is no <MASK> that alpha omega winery has any substantive business relationship with russian wine brokers . according to carter , the company \u2019 s primary business is in the united <MASK> : 90 percent of sales are direct - to - customer , and only 10 percent of sales are through distributors . most of the distribution occurs in the united <MASK> , with some sales in various countries , such as canada , japan , china , switzerland and thailand . <PARA> carter confirmed that luding was the broker that sells alpha omega \u2019 s wine to russian customers , but added the information was removed from the california winery \u2019 s web site because it was out of date . luding still lists alpha omega on its web site as a supplier , along with six other u . s . wineries . purchasers can select one of three offerings from alpha omega ( which were , as the company <MASK> , from vintages prior to 2013 : a 2009 cabernet sauvignon , a 2010 proprietary red or a 2012 chardonnay ). luding also lists wine makers from 31 other countries among its suppliers including france , spain , italy , south africa and new zealand . <PARA> scott dworkin , a community organizer for democratic coalition against trump , tweeted to his 111 , 000 followers that that luding was \u201c close \u201d to russian president vladimir putin , with the only <MASK> being that they had offered putin a birthday greeting and gift basket in 2007 . <PARA> we have not received a response from nunes \u2019 spokesman , jack langer . however , we don \u2019 t find the fact that alpha omega winery sold wine to a distributor in russia proves that nunes has any improper business interests in russia relating to his wine investment . if the company \u2019 s <MASK> is <MASK> that the wine was sold to luding for distribution in russia in 2013 , that would place the transaction well before the russian government was accused of meddling in the 2016 presidential election . there also doesn \u2019 t seem to be anything suspicious at face value about california wine being sold in russia \u2013 luding sells wine from all over the world to its customers .",

        "text": "as we \u2019 ve noted many times in these pages , one common way in which people attempt to demonstrate the aptness of a particular social or political viewpoint is to put its expression into the mouth of a revered historical figure . <PARA> surely if one of great minds of our civilization , someone who lived hundreds ( or even thousands ) of years ago , said the very same thing we \u2019 re thinking today , then surely that \u2019 s <MASK> we \u2019 ve hit upon some eternal truth that should be sagaciously heeded . in short , attributing apocryphal <MASK> to everyone from confucius to abraham lincoln is an attempt to capitalize on the maxim that \u201c great minds think alike .\u201d <PARA> one prime representative of this phenomenon is the passage reproduced above , which warns about the perils of governments \u2019 overspending their budgets and lavishing too much money on foreign aid and welfare programs . for the last half century it has been attributed to roman philosopher and <MASK> marcus tullius cicero and widely <MASK> by politicians and pundits seeking to bolster their arguments in favor of fiscal conservatism . for example , louisiana representative otto passman , who for thirty years \u201c pursued a relentless battle against spending for foreign aid \u201d in the u . s . congress , read these words into the congressional record on april 25 , 1968 : <PARA> on march 29 , 1971 the chicago tribune published a letter from a reader who invoked the same words to make a similar point : <PARA> those words were never uttered by cicero , however ; and the reason no one ever <MASK> them as such until about fifty years ago is because they weren \u2019 t written until 1965 . they sprang from the pen of taylor caldwell , a fiction writer best known for historical novels such as captains and the kings , her 1972 best - selling chronicle of the rise to wealth and power of an irish immigrant named joseph francis xavier armagh ( which was also made into a popular television mini - series in 1976 ). <PARA> caldwell penned several novels based on real - life religious and historical figures , including genghis khan ( the earth is the lord \u2019 s ), cardinal richelieu ( the arm and the darkness ), saint luke ( dear and glorious physician ), saint paul ( great lion of god ), aspasia ( glory and the lightning ), and judas iscariot ( i , judas ). her 1965 effort a pillar of iron was a historical novel about the life of cicero , the great roman <MASK> who \u201c is a pillar of iron as he publicly maintains his search for honor and justice under law in the face of plots against his life and his country .\u201d <PARA> although a pillar of iron often drew directly from the recorded speeches and letters of cicero for its dialogue , it was nonetheless a work of fiction , and the now famous <MASK> from cicero about \u201c balancing the budget \u201d was an invention of caldwell \u2019 s and not a reproduction of cicero \u2019 s own words . in fact , the novel doesn \u2019 t even present these words as something spoken by cicero , but rather as a summation of cicero \u2019 s political philosophy presented as a preface to an imagined conversation between cicero and gaius antonius hybrida : <PARA> as jess stearn observed in in search of taylor caldwell , this imagined historical conversation was reflective of caldwell \u2019 s own political outlook much more than cicero \u2019 s : \u201c she was a conservative politically , believing the spoils belonged to those who toiled for them . there were not free lunches . she abhorred the welfare philosophy that gave handouts to free - loaders , decrying rewards for indolence and incompetence .\u201d or , as john blundell aptly quipped in ladies for liberty , \u201c taylor caldwell gives us fiscal policy , civil service reform , cuts in aid to less developed countries , and welfare reform all in one sentence .\u201d <PARA> the reproductions of caldwell \u2019 s words as a historical <MASK> from cicero have altered the <MASK> a fair bit over the years : the admonition that \u201c prudence and frugality should be put into practice as soon as possible \u201d was quickly dropped from the end of the sentence ; \u201c people \u201d have replaced \u201c mobs \u201d as the ones who should be \u201c forced to work and not depend on the government for subsistence \u201d; the proclamation that the \u201c arrogance of the generals should be tempered and controlled \u201d now refers to generic \u201c officialdom \u201d rather than military figures ; and the warning that this advice need be followed \u201c lest rome become bankrupt \u201d has mutated into the more ominous - sounding \u201c lest rome fall .\u201d",

does the puffery inherent to this summary mean there was nothing substantial to celebrate , else the list would provide details of those in preference to making the wild <MASK> it does ?\u201d <PARA> which brings us to the twin sadnesses of the matter : the list serves to obscure african - american contributions that should have been celebrated by shifting attention to items that were not nearly as vital , and makes black men and women who invented great things appear trivial <PARA> by highlighting only their lesser innovations . <PARA> for example , you have richard spikes ( of the improved automatic gear shift discussed above ) to thank for your car \u2019 s turn signals . he invented automatic directional lights , which were first installed on a pierce arrow automobile in 1913 . <PARA> in 1935 frederick mckinley jones ( of the portable air conditioning unit ) invented the first refrigerated truck . he kept tinkering at his innovation , eventually developing a highly successful automatic refrigeration system for long - haul carriers . prior to jones \u2019 invention , many people were primarily limited to eating foods grown locally , because perishable goods could not be efficiently transported over longer distances . <PARA> percy julian came up with a soy protein concoction that put out gas and oil fires not extinguishable by water . this material , known as \u201c bean soup \u201d aboard u . s . navy ships , saved the lives of countless sailors during world war ii . that same man , percy julian , came up with a way to synthesize cortisone , a sterol that has eased the sufferings of millions . prior to his work , sterols cost several hundreds of dollars per gram ; his process brought that cost down to 20 cents per gram . <PARA> even the relatively minor innovations to existing technologies for which the african - americans listed above were responsible are important and vital in their own way , of course , but the \u201c life without black people \u201d piece misses its target due to too many inaccuracies and trivialities . there is much to laud in the roll call of black inventors , and someone should do them better service than the above - <MASK> <MASK> does . <PARA> barbara \u201c inventing my spleen \u201d mikkelson",

( through a variety of methods , snopes was able to independently verify that the jacob blake who was shot by police in august 2020 is indeed the same person for whom an arrest warrant was issued in july 2020 .) <PARA> according to a <MORE> whoever has sexual intercourse with a person without the consent of that person is guilty of a class g felony .\u201d <PARA> whoever created the widely shared graphic therefore took a screenshot of an authentic list of charges against blake , including third - degree sexual assault , but juxtaposed it with an excerpt from the laws of a different <MASK> , in order to give readers the entirely <MASK> impression that blake had been accused of committing an act of sexual penetration against a child . he had not . <MASK> that blake was a \u201c child rapist \u201d and had \u201c raped a child \u201d were therefore baseless . <PARA> a search of blake \u2019 s name in wisconsin circuit court records revealed only child support disputes and a june 2018 conviction in racine county on a charge of operating a vehicle without being in possession of a driver \u2019 s license , which is not a criminal offense and was resolved with a fine . blake is not listed on the wisconsin department of corrections sex offender registry . <PARA> in september 2015 , the racine county eye reported that blake had been arrested after brandishing a gun at a bar in racine , and that officers required the assistance of a police dog when blake allegedly refused to comply with their orders . he was charged with several offenses , including : felony resisting arrest \u201c causing a soft tissue injury to a police officer \u201d; carrying a firearm while intoxicated ; and endangering safety by the use of a dangerous weapon . <PARA> however , blake was never tried or convicted on those charges , and in august 2020 , the racine county eye reported that the charges appear to have been dismissed at the urging of the prosecutor and no longer appear in public court records . <PARA> similarly , blake has not been tried or convicted on the charges he faced in july 2020 , including third - degree sexual assault , and he has not yet entered a plea in that case . thus , social media posts that described blake as a \u201c convicted sex offender \u201d and \u201c convicted rapist \u201d were inaccurate at the time they were posted . <PARA> on aug . 24 , 2020 , retired police officer and right - wing commentator brandon tatum published a widely shared tweet in which he labeled blake a \u201c domestic abuser and sex offender \u201d and included a screenshot of the 2015 racine county eye <MASK> , adding the <MASK> that blake was \u201c known for pulling guns on people .\u201d as of aug . 26 , 2020 , blake had not yet even entered a plea in relation to the domestic abuse and sexual assault charges against him , not to mention being tried or convicted on them , and the latter accusation had to do with charges that were dropped by the prosecutor in the case .",

        "text": "u . s . senate minority leader chuck schumer ( d - new york ) is a career politician who cut his teeth in the new york <MASK> assembly before being elected to the u . s . house of representatives in 1981 , where he served nine terms prior to winning a u . s . senate seat in 1998 . <PARA> as the voice of the opposition party in the senate , schumer was frequently at odds with president trump and the republicans . these disputes spilled over into social media , where schumer not only exchanged barbs with the president himself , but was regularly attacked by trump supporters hoping to discredit him . <PARA> in december 2018 , some of trump \u2019 s followers shared posts asserting that schumer had been \u201c caught \u201d accepting excessive campaign contributions and failing to properly disclose expenses in 1998 : <PARA> the proximate source of the accusation appeared to be an 11 december editorial by fox news pundit tucker carlson attempting to refute the argument that trump \u2019 s alleged hush money payments to mistresses during the 2016 presidential campaign constituted grounds for impeachment because they violated campaign finance laws . <PARA> in defense of trump , carlson noted that both barack obama and chuck schumer paid hefty fines to the federal election commission ( fec ) for past campaign violations yet suffered no further legal consequences for their actions ( emphasis added ): <PARA> as we \u2019 ve had occasion to explain before , the hush money payments trump \u2019 s attorney admitted making on his behalf and more routine campaign finance violations such as failing to comply with contribution caps or improperly disclosing expenses bear little similarity . although obama \u2019 s 2008 campaign was indeed fined $ 375 , 000 by the fec for not providing timely notice of contributions exceeding $ 1 , 000 , the violation was not deemed intentional and did not rise to the level of a prosecutable offense . <PARA> neither did the violations alleged in schumer \u2019 s case rise to the level of a prosecutable offense , as enumerated in an fec audit report released to the public in april 2001 . the figures cited by carlson roughly matched those contained in a summary of the audit published that may : <PARA> as noted by the fec , the larger figure ($ 6 , 354 , 835 in improperly disclosed disbursements , characterized as \u201c expenses \u201d) comprised amounts that were erroneously reported as lump sum entries instead of being broken out by date and amount as required . the error was subsequently corrected . <PARA> it \u2019 s misleading to say that schumer was \u201c caught \u201d taking excessive campaign contributions . the contributions were categorized by the fec as such on a technicality : schumer \u2019 s campaign failed to comply with a rule ( later dropped from fec regulations ) stipulating that checks accepted from joint bank accounts be signed by both account holders . a small fraction of those donations were duly refunded , leaving an outstanding $ 854 , 404 in contributions that still met the criteria for being \u201c excessive ,\u201d fec auditors concluded . the schumer campaign committee \u2019 s lawyer affirmed to associated press in april 2003 that : <PARA> for the latter violation , the campaign agreed to pay a fine of $ 130 , 000 ( not $ 138 , 000 , as later <MASK> by carlson and others ). however , the suggestion that the violations and subsequent fine ought to have disqualified from remaining in office is unrealistic and naive . <PARA> \u201c there are always reporting violations in campaigns ,\u201d a former fec commissioner told us in february 2018 . some violations are more serious than others , but even when they result in large civil penalties ( as in the cases of the schumer and obama campaigns ), they are rarely regarded , in the absence of criminal intent , as having any bearing on a candidate \u2019 s fitness to hold office . in 1993 , for instance , the fec fined sen . bob dole \u2019 s ( r - kansas ) 1988 presidential campaign $ 120 , 000 for accepting improper corporate donations and exceeding spending limits , yet dole not only ran for president again but remained in office right up until his retirement in 1996 .",

wing conspiracy theories , attacking figures within the democratic party or perceived liberals , and demonstrating his fervent support for president trump by posting pro - trump memes and photographs of himself in attendance at trump rallies . <PARA> this set of facts prompted a \u201c <MASK> flag \u201d conspiracy theory which held that the mail - bombing campaign was a hoax , and that the entire episode had been cynically orchestrated by democrats or liberals with the aim of stoking outrage against president trump and his supporters and providing a boost to democratic candidates in the november 2018 elections . <PARA> as putative <MASK> , promoters of the conspiracy theory erroneously pointed to the uncancelled stamps which adorned some of the packages , the fact that postal workers do not directly deliver mail to secret service protectees such as former president barack obama and former secretary of <MASK> hillary clinton , a <MASK> <MASK> that sayoc was once a registered democrat , and a <MASK> <MASK> that his encounter with an old college soccer teammate was in fact <MASK> of a liberal conspiracy . <PARA> against this background , yet another strand to the \u201c <MASK> flag \u201d conspiracy theory emerged in late october when local news media in florida investigated sayoc \u2019 s personal and professional background , discovering that he had been working at the ultra lounge , a strip club in west palm beach , prior to his arrest . <PARA> that establishment had once hosted an event featuring stormy daniels , the porn actor and stripper who has <MASK> that donald trump had a sexual encounter with her in 2006 and then arranged the payment of \u201c hush money \u201d to her during the 2016 presidential election campaign . television <MASK> wptv reported of sayoc \u2019 s employment at the ultra lounge that : <PARA> this coincidence , that sayoc worked at the same florida strip club where stormy daniels had performed in april , then formed the basis of widespread speculation and innuendo which held that the two must have known each other , and therefore this relationship proved or suggested a two - pronged liberal conspiracy to damage the presidency and authority of donald trump : first by accusing him of an extramarital sexual relationship , and then by associating him with a campaign of terrorism by one of his supporters . <PARA> on 29 october , the conservative web site townhall reported on the \u201c ultra lounge \u201d link , asking : \u201c is all of this mere coincidence <MORE> and doorman at the strip club in the two months prior to his arrest in late october . this means he began working there at around the end of august 2018 . <PARA> on the other hand , stormy daniels was never employed at the ultra lounge but had worked there as a guest performer . according to the venue \u2019 s social media accounts , daniels performed just four shows at the ultra lounge , across only two days , 13 and 14 april 2018 \u2014 four and a half months before sayoc began working there . <PARA> so sayoc \u2019 s two months of employment at the ultra lounge did not overlap with the two days upon which daniels performed there . <PARA> beyond the fact that daniels performed at the ultra lounge four months before sayoc began working there , none of those <MASK> or speculating about a conspiracy involving sayoc and daniels have presented any other <MASK> that they knew each other , nor we were able to find any such <MASK> . <PARA> in order to <MASK> , based on the available <MASK> , that daniels and sayoc knew each other well enough to be engaged in what would be a high - risk and likely illegal conspiracy to bring down a sitting u . s . president , one must also <MASK> that everyone who provides a one - off service as a contractor to a particular business is equally closely connected to everyone who begins working at that business some months later . <PARA> same industry <PARA> even if <MASK> did exist that sayoc and daniels knew each other , there would be a perfectly sensible ( blindingly obvious , even ) explanation for such a connection : their professional interests overlapped . <PARA> daniels has been a porn actor and stripper for almost two decades and performed at the ultra lounge in april 2018 as part of a tour of strip clubs across the united <MASK> . sayoc , for his part , has worked as a manager for male strippers , performed as a male stripper himself , and was working as a dj and doorman at a strip club up to the time of his arrest in october 2018 . <PARA> the <MASK> likelihood of any randomly chosen stripper who lives in texas meeting a randomly chosen strip club doorman and former male stripper in florida might be relatively low , but it would not not require an elaborate , shadowy political conspiracy for those two individuals to bump into each other . <PARA> what the \u201c sayoc - daniels \u201d conspiracy theory misses , in this respect , is that <MASK> improbability is not at all the same thing as implausibility . when one considers how many clubs stormy daniels performs at in a given year , one might even say her working the same club as sayoc ( at different times ) was more probable than implausible :",

        "text": "in february 2016 , a meme about the lack of business acumen and experience exhibited by vermont senator bernie sanders , a democratic presidential candidate , began circulating online : <PARA> the criticisms offered in meme were a mixture of <MASK> , <MASK> , irrelevant , and misleading <MASK> . to wit : <PARA> never owned a business <PARA> right off , this meme begins with a rather nebulous criticism . although having owned a business is an experience many voters would like to see on the r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of a potential chief executive , a literal application of that term isn \u2019 t of much relevance . technically , a person who once operated a roadside lemonade stand has \u201c owned a business ,\u201d while a person who has spent his career serving as the ceo of a public multi - national , multi - billion dollar corporation has not \u2014 even though everyone would agree the latter has vastly more business experience than the former . and certainly a number of highly - regarded u . s . presidents in the modern era ( e . g ., franklin roosevelt , dwight eisenhower , john kennedy , ronald reagan ) never owned their own businesses . <PARA> moreover , one might validly say that sanders started and operated his own business ( whether he \u201c owned \u201d it is somewhat arguable , as it was a non - profit ), the american people \u2019 s historical society , which was created in 1978 to produce educational film strips about the <MASK> of vermont . the university of vermont has archived several of the brochures produced by the american people \u2019 s historical society , one of which includes a <MASK> from sanders outlining the purpose of his film strips : <PARA> while the financials of the american people \u2019 s historical society are not available , sanders wrote in his memoir outsider in the house that the business was reasonably successful and \u201c a lot of fun .\u201d a friend of sanders \u2019 told politico that the film strip business \u201c wasn \u2019 t just a way to make money ... he made filmstrips about people he admired and believed in . he just thought kids should know the truth of how things really were .\u201d <PARA> never invented anything <PARA> once again , this is a rather nebulous criticism . the concept of \u201c inventing \u201d something could range from simply thinking up a novel idea ( but doing nothing more about it ), to creating and building a device for personal use ( but not marketing it ), to actually obtaining a patent for a new product . bernie sanders is certainly no inventor and holds no patents , but it \u2019 s hard to see how that fact is of any relevance , as the same is <MASK> of nearly every u . s . president . <PARA> thomas jefferson might legitimately be considered an inventor <MORE> holds six senate committee appointments ), meet with constituents , participate in oversight and investigation of governmental affairs , etc ., as detailed in \u201c the many roles of a member of congress \u201d: <PARA> lived off welfare before elected to public office <PARA> as noted above , various acquaintances who knew sanders in the years before he achieved public office have reported that he was \u201c always poor ,\u201d and he likely received public assistance at some point during that time , although what form of ( and how much ) assistance he received is difficult to determine at this remove . a contemporaneous newspaper account from the bennington banner reported that in 1974 , when sanders ran for the u . s . senate on the liberty union party ticket , he was collecting unemployment benefits : <PARA> 74 year old \u2014 personal net worth of $ 300 , 000 <PARA> as 247 wall st . reported , determining the precise net worth of candidates is difficult for a number of reasons : <PARA> 247 wall st . attempted to determine each presidential candidate \u2019 s net worth in an <MASK> published on 24 august 2015 . they estimated that sanders was one of the \u201c poorest presidential candidates \u201d running for office in 2016 , with a likely net worth somewhere around $ 330 , 000 : <PARA> as of late 2019 , open secrets , the website of the center for responsive politics , estimated sanders \u2019 net worth at between $ 729 , 000 and $ 1 . 8 million , making him neither the richest nor the poorest presidential hopeful in the 2020 field . <PARA> in any case , the meme \u2019 s characterization of sanders as a \u201c loser \u201d based on his net worth evinces a rather skewed perspective . although many people view financial rewards as a tangible measure of one \u2019 s success , it is far from the only factor by which accomplishment can be measured . ( in fact , highly - regarded president harry s . truman had virtually no net worth even after leaving the white house in 1953 and afterwards was largely dependent upon congress \u2019 finally establishing a pension for former presidents .) <PARA> bernie sanders might equally be considered a \u201c winner \u201d for persevering at his goal of achieving a political career long after others might have given up , and for succeeding at that effort despite prolonged financial hardship . unlike many others , sanders might also be lauded for maintaining a rather plain life and not having enriched himself in public service ( especially since candidates at the other end of the financial spectrum are frequently criticized for being \u201c out of touch with the common man \u201d). <PARA> as 247 wall st . wrote of sanders : <PARA> all in all , that sounds like quite an impressive career achievement for anyone \u2014 regardless of net worth .",

        "text": "in august 2017 , several news outlets reported that public health authorities in the <MASK> of iowa had advised against serving certain alcoholic drinks in copper mugs : <PARA> iowa \u2019 s alcoholic beverages division did indeed publish an advisory bulletin on 28 july 2017 : <PARA> the bulletin goes on to explain that the food and drug administration food code prohibits food or drink with ph levels of below 6 ( that is , relatively acidic food and drinks ) coming in contact with copper at a licensed premises like a bar or restaurant . the reasoning behind this , according to page 485 of the fda food code , is that there is a slight but definite risk of poisoning : <PARA> the fda code adds that anyone serving beverages ( including water ) through pipes must also have adequate mechanisms in place to prevent copper from leaching into drinks . it also points out that while copper is an important part of the fermentation required to brew beer , too much copper ( above 0 . 2 mg per liter ) kills yeast , so the level of copper leached into successfully - brewed beer falls below what is toxic to humans ( about 3 . 5 mg per liter and above ). <PARA> the 28 july 2017 <MASK> by the iowa alcoholic beverages division does not contain new information , new research , or a new warning about drinking from copper mugs . it is effectively a reminder , in light of the recent popularity of the moscow mule , that iowa has incorporated the federal regulations contained in the fda food code . that code has contained the same restrictions on copper plumbing and containers , and the same rationale , since at least 1997 . <PARA> it \u2019 s clear that although copper is an important naturally occurring trace element , it can also be toxic to humans . it is also clear that toxic levels of copper can leach into food and water through both copper containers ( such as those used for acidic drinks like the moscow mule and other beverages ) and through copper or copper alloy plumbing . <PARA> however , what \u2019 s less clear is how much copper is enough to make you sick , and how likely it is that you \u2019 ll be harmed by drinking a cocktail from a copper mug . <PARA> in 1991 , the environmental protection agency established a \u201c maximum contaminant level goal \u201d for copper of 1 . 3 mg per liter of fluid ( page 130 ). according to the epa , the mclg is \u201c the maximum level of a contaminant in drinking water at which no known or anticipated adverse effect on the health of persons would occur , allowing an adequate margin of safety \u201d. a 1999 study in the journal environmental health perspectives concluded that copper levels above 3 mg per liter of drinking water <MORE> replied : <PARA> solioz emphasized that while the risk from typical consumption is probably low for most people , a small proportion of the population ( around 1 in 30 , 000 people ) have wilson disease , which causes an accumulation of copper within the body , and could potentially be harmed by consuming acidic beverages from a copper container . <PARA> while most people are able to effectively secrete copper , solioz said , those with wilson disease struggle to do this , so even the relatively low level of copper leached into a drink could make them sick . <PARA> solioz told us he was unaware of any research which specifically measured the rate of copper leaching in containers carrying beverages of various acidities , and over various time periods . we were also unable to find such research . <PARA> the closest thing to this that we could find was a short 1957 report published in the american journal of public health . this report described an outbreak of nausea , vomiting and diarrhea among nurses at a military hospital in 1954 . the nurses consumed cocktails at a party that had been sitting in copper - contaminated cocktail shakers for more than two hours before many of them became sick . dr john wylie , the report \u2019 s author , wrote : <PARA> the cocktail was reconstructed , yielding the equivalent of 179 mg of copper per liter . wylie concluded : <PARA> it \u2019 s very difficult to conclude anything from this about the rate at which cocktails might typically become contaminated in copper containers : this was a short and decades - old case report , not a scientific study ( which could have controlled for various possible causal factors ); the author does not make it clear whether he himself was present for the incident ; and wylie also suggests that the level of copper leaching in the cocktail was linked to significant damage to the container . despite these serious shortcomings , the 1957 report formed the basis of the epa \u2019 s 1991 decision that the \u201c maximum contaminant level goal \u201d for copper in drinking water should be 1 . 3 mg per liter . this recommendation remains in place in august 2017 . <PARA> we also asked iowa \u2019 s department of inspections and appeals for <MASK> on reports of copper poisoning in the <MASK> , in order to see whether there had been a spike in symptoms accompanying the increased popularity of the moscow mule , but we were told that the <MASK> \u2019 s department of public health does not track such reports . <PARA> iowa \u2019 s alcoholic beverages division , meanwhile , recommends that if bar and restaurant owners are going to use copper mugs for highly - acidic drinks like the moscow mule , they should use copper mugs lined on the inside with other metals like nickel or stainless steel .",

        "text": "in april 2019 , washington <MASK> sen . maureen walsh attracted local and national attention \u2014 and criticism \u2014 for remarks she made during a debate about legislation intended to improve nurses \u2019 working conditions . <PARA> on 19 april , the website nurse . org posted a widely shared <MASK> whose headline read : \u201c senator remarks go viral : nurses \u2018 play cards for a considerable amount of the day .'\u201d the <MASK> went on : <PARA> walsh did say , of nurses in certain hospitals , that they \u201c probably play cards for a considerable amount of the day ,\u201d and she has since said she regrets having done so . however , she made her remarks in a very specific context , and was not referring to all nurses everywhere , despite the impression given in much subsequent commentary and reporting . <PARA> the walla walla senator was speaking during a washington senate floor debate on 16 april , on the subject of shb 1155 , a piece of legislation that would require health - care providers to give clinical employees uninterrupted meal and rest breaks during their shifts , except in emergencies . <PARA> more specifically , walsh was speaking in support of amendment 724 , which was put forward by her republican colleague <MASK> sen . curtis king . that amendment would exempt a certain category of hospitals ( critical access hospitals ) from the requirements of the bill . <PARA> critical access hospitals ( cahs ) are smaller , typically rural hospitals with fewer than 25 in - patient beds that are legally designated as cahs by the federal centers for medicare and medicaid services . because they typically serve relatively isolated rural communities , they receive certain financial support and benefits from the federal government in order to ensure their ongoing sustainability . <PARA> walsh supported the proposed exemption of cahs from the meal and rest - break requirements in shb 1155 , arguing that staff there were not typically as busy as their counterparts in other hospitals , and therefore did not require such mandatory regular breaks . in the interest of completeness , here are walsh \u2019 s remarks in full , which can also be watched here ( beginning at around 9 : 10 ): <PARA> in a <MASK> sent to snopes , the washington <MASK> nurses association rejected one of the premises of walsh \u2019 s call for cahs to be exempted from the proposed new requirements , arguing that , far from being in grave financial danger , \u201c the majority of these small , rural hospitals are financially healthy and well equipped to implement shb 1155 \u2019 s patient safety standards ,\u201d adding that : \u201c over the last four years of reports , the total net income ( surplus ) for washington \u2019 s 40 critical access hospitals is $ 208 , 657 , 776 , with an average surplus of $ 5 , 216 , 444 per hospital . <PARA> when one views walsh \u2019 s remarks in their full and proper context , it \u2019 s clear that her \u201c playing cards \u201d comment related specifically to nurses in cahs (\u201c those nurses \u201d). she was not <MASK> that all nurses everywhere spend much of their working days playing cards . <PARA> this is in contrast to the impression created by much of the subsequent coverage of her remarks . for example , nurse . org summarized her remarks as \u201c nurses \u2018 play cards for a considerable amount of the day ,'\u201d without reflecting that walsh was actually describing only a relatively small subcategory of nurses . <PARA> on 19 april , juliana bindas started an online petition on change . org that called for walsh to follow a nurse around during a 12 - hour shift . the text that accompanied the petition ( which had more than 500 , 000 signatures as of 22 april ) also provided a misleading characterization of the senator \u2019 s comments , <MASK> \u201c senator maureen walsh <MASK> that we as nurses mostly spend our 12 hour shifts playing cards .\u201d <PARA> similarly , many online memes and social media responses markedly failed to recognize that walsh \u2019 s remarks had referred to a specific cohort of nurses , and not all nurses in every context . headlines published by major national news outlets including cnn and the hill also failed to reflect the specific context of walsh \u2019 s comments , instead giving the misleading impression she had been talking about all nurses . <PARA> on 20 april , walsh told the tri - city herald newspaper she regretted her comments , saying \u201c i was tired . i said something i wish i hadn \u2019 t .\u201d in a <MASK> provided to the local kepr television <MASK> , the <MASK> senator elaborated further and clarified that her remarks were indeed specifically in reference to nurses at cahs : <PARA> \u201c my mother was [ a registered nurse ] for many years and i have the greatest respect for nurses . the comment made about the ability to play cards was referring to the staff at the very rural and small critical access hospitals who may only serve a handful of patients and [ where ] the staffing mandates are unnecessary .\u201d <PARA> on 16 april , the washington <MASK> senate passed amendment 724 , along with the revised version of shb 1155 , which subsequently included an exemption for cahs . in the house , a different version of the bill had already been passed , meaning the legislation was scheduled for reconciliation between the two chambers , as of 22 april .",

<PARA> it all comes down to plot device . the signs , you see , are the means by which the government \u2019 s evil plan is revealed to the unsuspecting citizenry . if a truck full of \u201c road closed \u201d signs spilled its contents , not even the most charismatic <MASK> would be able to convince anyone this was all tied to a federal plot to take over the country . but make them \u201c by order of martial law \u201d signs , and the <MASK> now has legs to run on . <PARA> ( revelation by way of written communication turns up in urban legends whenever a device is needed to propel the <MASK> forward by way of explaining actions that have taken place . a fine example of this serves as the lynchpin for the dishonest note tale , wherein the miscreant gives away his ruse in the note he pens ; in real life he \u2019 d either simply scribble something innocuous or just leave a blank piece of paper behind .) <PARA> conspiracy <MASK> like this one play upon fears that the government has too much power and will use it against its citizens given any opportunity to do so . versions of the <MASK> that bring walmart into the picture as a partner in the impending takeover ( by contracting to carry such signs in their trucks ) further establish the basis for this <MASK> as one of fear of the all - powerful : like the government , walmart is viewed by many as a predatory entity too big to control with the ability to be a law unto itself . <PARA> only once in u . s . <MASK> has a president declared martial law on a national basis , and that occurrence took place during the civil war , when abraham lincoln suspended habeas corpus for \u201c prisoners of war , spies , or aiders and abettors of the enemy \u201d throughout the united <MASK> . outside of wartime , all other instances of martial law in the u . s . have been imposed on a local basis by governors or mayors .",

        "text": "on 3 april 2003 , master sgt . james e . valrie saluted a united <MASK> flag flying over a desert airfield in southern iraq at sunset . a photograph of the moment was captured by his wife , marine sgt . tisha carter - valrie : <PARA> that photograph was later released by the u . s . marine corps has been widely shared online ( often without attribution ) in the ensuing years . it has been posted on numerous blogs , web sites , and social media pages , made into tattoos and postcards , and has even been included in multiple memorial day messages posted by the rock band kiss . <PARA> in july 2018 , this patriotic and moving photograph became the subject of a small controversy when actor james woods <MASK> that he had received a warning about \u201c offensive \u201d content from twitter after he shared the image with his followers : <PARA> we attempted to contact woods about the warning he allegedly received but did not receive a response . it \u2019 s possible that he truly did receive such a warning ( he didn \u2019 t <MASK> whether the image was accompanied by any text , which could have been the \u201c offensive \u201d portion of the tweet ), but we \u2019 re skeptical that the image alone raised any red flags with twitter , for a number of reasons . <PARA> for starters , this isn \u2019 t the first time this photograph has been shared on the social network . in fact , woods himself previously used this image in 2015 to call for a boycott of pacsun after the clothing retailer was criticized for selling a t - shirt featuring an upside - down american flag : <PARA> that 2015 tweet has resided on woods \u2019 timeline for three years without issue . as of this writing , it is still available . <PARA> we searched twitter for other instances of people sharing this photograph over the years and came up with numerous examples , including at least one case in which a user adopted the image as their profile pic , and a tweet from lara trump in may 2018 . <PARA> if twitter truly deemed the image \u201c offensive ,\u201d these posts would have likely been taken down . however , we \u2019 ve yet to come across any credible instances of the social network removing this photograph for violating its rules . <PARA> when we reached out to the company to find out why ( or if ) they had issued a warning to woods after he allegedly posted the photograph , they told us that they couldn \u2019 t comment on the activity of an individual account . they did say , however , that twitter would never \u201c take action on accounts or content that are not in violation of our rules .\u201d <PARA> so is the photograph in violation of twitter \u2019 <MORE> <PARA> as it has been repeatedly shared on twitter without issue for a number of years , it seems safe to say that this photograph of a marine saluting a flag does not violate the social network \u2019 s terms of service . <PARA> woods \u2019 <MASK> that his posting of the image triggered an offensive content warning is reminiscent of a ploy used by troll facebook pages to stir up anger over non - existent issues . one popular image of a little boy saluting a flag is frequently shared , for instance , as if its \u201c hateful \u201d content were being removed from facebook ( despite the fact that the \u201c banned \u201d image is included in the very posts <MASK> it has been removed ): <PARA> we investigated this <MASK> back in 2015 and found that it , too , was <MASK> . <PARA> it \u2019 s possible that woods received a warning message about \u201c offensive \u201d content after posting an image of a marine saluting a flag , but if so , it \u2019 s likely that the warning had more to do with the accompanying text than the image itself . it \u2019 s also possible that the warning woods allegedly received was due to a twitter user , not the social network itself , flagging the content for being inappropriate for some unexplained reason . <PARA> the <MASK> tweet woods spoke of is not on his timeline ( nor did we find any record of it in archives of woods \u2019 page , nor in any mentions from his followers , further adding to our skepticism about the <MASK> ), and the actor did not provide specifics about the content of the tweet ( other than the inclusion of a photograph ). therefore , we \u2019 re unable to comment on which part of woods \u2019 message could have been deemed \u201c offensive .\u201d <PARA> we can say , however , that the photograph of master sgt . james e . valrie saluting the united <MASK> flag is not itself in violation of twitter \u2019 s rules . <PARA> one final note on this viral photograph : the image shared by woods ( and so many others on twitter ) shows the flag at half - mast , but this is actually a doctored version of the <MASK> . marine sgt . carter - valrie , who took the photograph , told the los angeles times in 2013 that although the image of her late husband ( master sgt . valrie passed away in 2009 after a battle with kidney cancer ) was a wonderful tribute , she was dismayed at how the image had been manipulated over the years to serve various political purposes : <PARA> carter - valrie provided a copy of the <MASK> photograph , as well as two subsequent snaps of her late husband as he lowered the flag in iraq , to the los angeles times :",

        "text": "variations : in december 2008 , the canada revenue agency ( canada \u2019 s tax department , formerly revenue canada ) issued a warning about a similar scheme being run on canadian taxpayers . <PARA> <MASK> : in april 2002 , a new ruse designed to trick victims into giving out personal information that could lead to identity theft was unleashed on the unsuspecting throughout the usa . it arrived in the form of fake internal revenue service forms which appeared to have been mailed by taxpayers \u2019 <PARA> banks . <PARA> here \u2019 s how the scam worked : an account holder would receive a letter on bank <MASK> requesting information for the purpose of reporting earnings to the internal revenue service . attached to the letter would be a fake irs form identified as w - 9095 . the phony document was based on a valid irs form called a w - 9 and thus would look passingly familiar to those accustomed to dealing with irs forms . those less familiar with tax forms would still be taken in by the ruse because the phony request for detailed information appeared genuine . <PARA> the letter would say the recipient must return the completed by fax within seven days or the government would withhold 31 % of the interest on his bank accounts . the happy prospect of keeping one - third of the taxpayer \u2019 s earned interest out of the government \u2019 s hands and the fear - inspiring impetus of having to act quickly ( within seven days , remember ) would imbue this combination of promise and threat with an untold power to persuade , one that would likely temporarily blind the victim to what was really going on . <PARA> the real form ( the w - 9 ) doesn \u2019 t ask for account numbers , but the bogus form ( the w - 9095 ) did . it also asked for marital <MASK> , place of birth , parents \u2019 names , bank account number , passport information , work <MASK> , and passwords ; \u2014 in other words , just about everything a con artist would need to financially impersonate the victim . <PARA> similar fake forms were labeled w - 88ben and w - 8888 . ( banks use a legitimate w - 88ben to confirm non - u . s . customers can remain exempt from tax reporting requirements , but the real w - 88ben does not ask for the depth of taxpayer information the fake one did .) <PARA> there \u2019 s no way of telling how many folks have fallen for this trick or what the provision of their private information cost them in cold hard currency , but it doesn \u2019 t take great imagination to picture what use any halfway skilled swindler could put such information to . armed with all the completed forms gave , it would be child \u2019 s play to empty bank accounts and apply for charge cards and loans in the pigeon \u2019 s name . <PARA> this con contains the potential to be highly effective because little about it looks out of place or obviously wrong . folks trust their banks ( they leave their money there , after all ), so letters from such bastions of trust asking recipients to complete yet another tax form won \u2019 t be greeted with skepticism , especially when those letters also contain the news that doing so is eminently to the benefit of the account holders . likewise , that an irs form would ask for everything short of shoe size wouldn \u2019 t strike many as in any way unusual . about the only part of the transaction that might cause an eyebrow or two to be lifted is the insistence that the completed forms be faxed to the irs rather than returned by mail . yet once again , in a world now accustomed to the notion that personal tax returns can be e - filed with taxpayers \u2019 signatures faxed in support of the electronically transferred returns , faxing doesn \u2019 t seem terribly out of place . <PARA> it always pays to be wary . make the time to call your bank when asked for such information , even if it appears it \u2019 s the irs doing the asking . better to waste five minutes on the phone convincing your bank that you \u2019 re an idiot than keeping those five minutes to yourself and proving that you are . <PARA> those who have received questionable documents that purported to be from the irs or who have completed such forms and faxed them off should call 1 - 800 - 829 - 0433 , the irs hotline . they should also contact the various credit bureaus to alert them that their identities might have been stolen and to be on the look out for newly acquired charge cards under their name . <PARA> barbara \u201c credit carded \u201d mikkelson",

        "text": "according to a now - viral tiktok video posted on dec . 8 , 2020 , as much as 95 % of serotonin \u2014 a key neurotransmitter that plays a role in regulating mood \u2014 may be produced in the gastrointestinal tract : <PARA> \u201c the bacteria in your gut produce about 90 % of the serotonin in your body ,\u201d said social media user gianusystem , a self - identified online community dedicated to bringing awareness to dissociative identity disorder , or multiple personality disorder . the woman goes on to cite an <MASK> in discover magazine , adding that she was skeptical of new information that she hadn \u2019 t heard before . <PARA> \u201c so , i went and looked this up . that \u2019 s the low number ,\u201d said in the video , which at the time of writing had been shared more than 20 , 500 times . <PARA> snopes also looked up the information and found that the <MASK> is mostly <MASK> : estimates suggest that up to 95 % of the serotonin in the body is released in the gut through certain intestinal cells . but there is an important caveat to note : most studies that link serotonin production to the gastrointestinal system have been conducted in animals . according to an <MASK> titled \u201c gut bacteria \u2019 s role in anxiety and depression : it \u2019 s not just in your head ,\u201d which appeared in the november 2020 issue of the science magazine discover , author elizabeth svoboda reported that about 90 % of serotonin produced in the human body is done so in the gut . <PARA> serotonin is a hormone and neurotransmitter responsible for sending chemical messages between cells to play a key role in stabilizing mood , feelings , and happiness . in the brain , serotonin allows cells of the nervous system to communicate with one another and when too little serotonin is produced , a person may experience anxiety , depression , and other emotional and behavioral disorders . such conditions are typically treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( ssris ), or antidepressants , that the mayo clinic said work by increasing levels of serotonin by blocking the reuptake of serotonin into some neurons , making the hormone more available to improve the transmission of messages . <PARA> while serotonin is most well - known for its role in the brain , the hormone is also found in the stomach and intestines where it helps to maintain bowel movements and function , noted the hormone health network , an affiliate of the endocrine society . and some researchers postulate that a greater understanding of serotonin production in the gut may inform the treatment of certain mental health conditions in the brain . <PARA> in 2015 , researchers at the california institute of technology demonstrated that bacteria normally present in the gut can stimulate the intestinal cells to produce serotonin \u2014 as much as 90 % of which is made in the digestive tract . in mice , a particular mixture of bacteria also found in the human gut produced molecules that signaled to gut cells to increase the production of serotonin . modified mice that did not have the bacteria had more than 50 % of their gut serotonin missing . adding that bacterial mixture \u2014 which contained turicibacter sanguinis and clostridia \u2014 increased serotonin back to a normal level . though the study was conducted on mice , the scientist wrote in the journal cell that the findings lend important insight into how the gut microbiome can influence the nervous system . <PARA> four years later , those same researchers set out to inform how the 100 trillion or so bacteria and hormones that live in the human intestinal system may produce serotonin . this time around , researchers added serotonin to the drinking water of some mice and raised others with a mutation that increased the levels of serotonin in their guts . an analysis of the mice microbiota showed that the presence of t . sanguinis and clostridia increased significantly when there was more serotonin in the gut . as part of the study , mice were also given fluoxetine , or prozac , which was shown to block the serotonin transporter in the t . sanguinis , which slowed the transport of serotonin . <PARA> \u201c previous studies from our lab and others showed that specific bacteria promote serotonin levels in the gut ,\u201d said study author thomas fung at the time in a news release . \u201c our new study tells us that certain gut bacteria can respond to serotonin and drugs that influence serotonin , like anti - depressants . this is a unique form of communication between bacteria and our own cells through molecules traditionally recognized as neurotransmitters .\u201d <PARA> so while it is <MASK> that a large proportion of the body \u2019 s serotonin is produced in the guts \u2014 and serotonin - targeting drugs can have a major effect on the gut \u2019 s microbiota \u2014 the exact mechanisms behind the production are not yet known . furthermore , it is important to consider that many of the studies have been conducted on mice and not necessarily in humans . <PARA> regardless , because most treatments for depression deal with serotonin receptors in the brain , understanding how and where the hormone is produced may help to inform future treatments into emotional and behavioral disorders such as anxiety and depression .",

        "text": "examples : <PARA> i just heard today a <MASK> that sounded like a hoax but couldn \u2019 t find it on your board . a friend went into a kids hair salon and was asking about shampoo . the beautician said that there was a recent show on 20 / 20 or 60 minutes , etc . that said johnson & johnson adds novocaine to their \u201c no more tears \u201d shampoo . the novocaine is added to prevent the burning sensation in the eyes . <PARA> [ collected via e - mail , march 2004 ] <PARA> someone told me that reason that johnson \u2019 s no more tears baby shampoo works is not because it \u2019 s gentle but because it has something in it that numbs children \u2019 s eyes to the sting of the cleansers . she was trying to sell us her company \u2019 s line of baby products that are gentler and i have to admit she caught my attention . though it does smack of urban legend material ! <PARA> [ collected via e - mail , august 2004 ] <PARA> only last night i was told that johnson and johnson no tears baby wash / shampoo had formaldahyde or novacaine ( or some kind of \u201c caine \u201d) in its ingredients so that it numbs the babies eyes so they don \u2019 t feel the sting . <PARA> [ collected via e - mail , november 2011 ] <PARA> a friend who is expecting , and who is normally very tech - savvy , has <MASK> outright that she refuses to use johnson & johnson products as they \u201c put anasthetic in the \u2018 no more tears \u2019 shampoo so that the children don \u2019 t cry \u2013 it \u2019 s not a weaker or different shampoo at all \u201d, and that \u201c many of their baby products like baby powder are carcinogenic \u201d. <PARA> <MASK> : we \u2019 re not sure how long the <MASK> that \u201c no tears \u201d baby shampoos contain desensitizing agents ( novocaine , lidocaine , xylocaine ) has been around , but we \u2019 ve been encountering it since at least 1994 . the <MASK> plays upon a deep - seated belief that some things are too good to be <MASK> ; in this case , that belief is applied to the notion that if a shampoo doesn \u2019 t irritate a baby \u2019 s eyes when it finds its way into them , this lack of suffering must be due to the presence of some sort of anesthetic that numbs the delicate tissues it encounters . <PARA> concerns to the contrary , there are no anesthetics in these products . if there were , caregivers everywhere would be experiencing numbness in their hands after washing their children \u2019 s hair . moreover , if novocaine or any of its cousins were used in baby shampoo to produce a \u201c no tears \u201d effect , that usage would create the dangerous situation of the shampoo \u2019 s potentially causing harm to a child \u2019 s eyes while suppressing the warning signs ( pain ) and natural defenses ( tears ) that protect against such harm . <PARA> overdoses of lidocaine have led to severe toxicity or death in both children and adults , so there is an especial need to protect youngsters from overexposure to that drug \u2014 amounts that are innocuous for grownups may present a significant <PARA> toxic hazard in children . if for no other reason than that , makers of baby shampoo would not use lidocaine in their products given <PARA> the risk of accidental oral ingestion of soap suds by children . <PARA> \u201c no more tears \u201d shampoos gain that effect from the nature of the chemicals used in their formulation , which trade off cleansing ability for mildness . mainstream shampoos generally contain lauryl sulfates that irritate the eyes and scalp but also leave hair very , very clean . baby shampoos instead use long chain surfactants ( which are far less efficient in emulsifying oil from hair ) or they include an ionic polymer in the formulation , either of which helps prevent the product from stinging when it gets into the eyes . <PARA> however , that is not to say that all has always been well with baby shampoos . in 2009 , the campaign for safe cosmetics analyzed the contents of dozens of products for children and discovered many of those goods contained two substances they identified as being of particular concern : formaldehyde and 1 , 4 dioxane . that organization brought pressure to bear upon johnson & johnson , the maker of johnson \u2019 s \u00ae baby shampoo ( which as been on the market since 1953 ), to reformulate their product to remove a chemical that releases formaldehyde , a known carcinogen . in august 2012 , johnson & johnson pledged to eliminate formaldehyde , parabens , triclosan , and phthalates from all their baby products , and in may 2013 announced that they had done so . <PARA> 1 , 4 - dioxane , which forms as a byproduct during the manufacturing process of certain cosmetic ingredients , is harder to eliminate . johnson & johnson says it has reformulated about 70 percent of their baby products to reduce the amount of 1 , 4 - dioxane contained in them . <PARA> barbara \u201c chemical solution \u201d mikkelson",

it instead governs the small amounts of pesticide residue allowed to remain in , or on , food products . these limits , termed maximum residue tolerances or limits ( mrls ) are different depending upon both the chemical used and the commodity type because the level of exposure to pesticide residue a consumer might experience through diet differs depending upon the food type . <PARA> in some cases , residue limits are set for dried tea , which is the type of testing highlighted in fraser \u2019 s <MASK> . setting such limits is a scientifically demanding process , and not all pesticides that show up in tests have established limits for dried tea products . in such cases , the presence of a pesticide - related chemical in the food commodity means the product is considered \u201c adulterated ,\u201d but that does not mean the product is necessarily subject to regulatory action , as explained to us via email by u . s . food and drug administration ( fda ) residue expert chris sack : <PARA> in essence , this means there are two ways to run afoul of food residue laws as they regard the trace presence of pesticide in food commodities . in cases where there are enough data and research to determine an mrl value for a specific pesticide , a food product can contain levels above a \u201c legally acceptable limit .\u201d in cases where no mrl is set for a certain chemical on a certain commodity , the mere presence ( above 0 . 01 ppm ) of that chemical is a violation of the law <MORE> larger number of pesticides existed in concentrations that had been medically evaluated to be harmful to humans , as opposed to counting only those chemicals whose presence alone constituted a violation . <PARA> propochlor is considered a human carcinogen under california \u2019 s proposition 65 , but every cup of coffee sold is considered a carcinogen under california law as well since the law is blind to the how much of a given chemical is present . <PARA> while allowable tolerances for propochlor exist in other products , no such limits have been established for tea , and therefore its presence in a children \u2019 s tea product ( if <MASK> ) should be troubling . the company faced widespread online backlash and a temporary reduction in share value as a result of the report . <PARA> for what it \u2019 s worth , hain - celestial described glaucus \u2019 s results as \u201c <MASK> and misleading \u201d and <MASK> they undertook to have the brands highlighted by the glaucus report retested , finding that no pesticides were detected : <PARA> after we reached out to fraser , she updated her post with more detail about some of the chemicals she highlighted . these updates , however , did not really take into account scale . for example , she highlighted endosulfan as an example of a dangerous level of a pesticide residue : <PARA> this <MASK> is <MASK> , but the cbc results she highlighted showed levels of endosulfan in tea at concentrations of 0 . 04 ppm . in the united <MASK> , endosulfan \u2019 s presence would not be a violation until it reached a concentration of 24 ppm , orders of magnitude higher than the level found in uncle lee \u2019 s legends of china green tea . <PARA> in short , the <MASK> of dangerous pesticides \u201c above the legal limit \u201d rely on incorrect or misleading descriptions of out - of - date testing that was performed in most cases by advocacy groups . these misleading and outdated descriptions were presented , at least in part , for the purpose of making a profit off people clicking online links for organic tea products and muddied the online discourse surrounding pesticide and food science . while the reports accurately highlighted the presence of some pesticide - related chemicals that do not have mrl limits set for dried tea contained in tea products , those reports in nearly all cases did not provide <MASK> of \u201c dangerous \u201d or \u201c deadly \u201d levels of those chemicals , just their trace presence . <PARA> \u201c it \u2019 s now almost 2019 ,\u201d fraser wrote in a 1 december 2018 update to her post , \u201c and seeing as how these studies were conducted over four years ago , it is hard to say whether they have changed up the pesticides they are using , or whether they have stopped using them at all .\u201d we concur .",

mail forwards . the early fears were further intensified when a new round of faxes went out a few weeks later , these announcing a \u201c blood initiation weekend \u201d of september 25 and 26 of that year : <PARA> \u201c blood initiation weekend \u201d came and went without incident . meanwhile , fake memos continued to circulate , each issuing a dire warning about this new gang initiation rite . the alerts looked credible \u2014 they were printed on what was purported to be sacramento ( california ) or illinois <MASK> police letterhead . the police department in lynn ( massachusetts ) also got into the act when a prankster induced it to issue a warning . all three of those law enforcement agencies fielded thousands of calls about the alerts they had supposedly authored . <PARA> the <MASK> <MASK> struck especially hard in massachusetts , illinois , michigan , new york <MASK> , california , and texas . from the end of 1993 until february 1994 , it went into remission . then a massillon woman revived it with a one - page handwritten flier that said police were warning women to be aware because a gang was coming from detroit to recruit members . initiation would be to kill a woman at belden village mall . in <MORE> credibility , convincing many it really was an official warning from the rcmp . the confusion prompted the rcmp to post a denial on their web site : <PARA> in september 2005 the unfounded warning about new members gaining acceptance into gangs via this method came to life once again , with warnings about the upcoming \u201c blood initiation weekend \u201d springing up in communities across the nation . but of course what had people going in 2005 was but a reworking of previous baseless scares : <PARA> in late october 2005 , the hoax hammered mexico , with at least three different <MASK> agencies in that country issuing press releases about a guatemalan gang named \u201c los sangre \u201d ( the blood ). supposedly , the guatemalan office of interpol alerted mexico \u2019 s federal agency of investigation , who in turn notified local authorities in michoacan to this gang \u2019 s presence in mexico and its plans to initiate new recruits during the two weekends prior to halloween by having gang hopefuls drive about in darkened cars , then chase down and kill ordinary citizens who flashed headlights at them . these official alerts were quickly spread through the media to the general population , causing a great deal of anxiety . we were unable to locate any mentions of a guatemalan gang or drug cartel going by the name \u201c los sangre ,\u201d which would likely not be the case for a group of thugs that had a high enough profile for interpol to know about it . by contrast , references to real guatemalan gangs , such as mara salvatrucha and mara 18 ( aka ms - 18 ), are rife . <PARA> in november 2010 the \u201c lights out !\u201d warning came to be passed along as a cell phone text message . <PARA> throughout the <MASK> of the \u201c lights out !\u201d scare there have been occasional incidents involving flashing headlights that appear to fit the pattern of the legend but are merely incidental to it : spontaneous outbursts of road rage triggered by flashing headlights , criminals who used headlights as a way of luring prospective victims into stopping and getting out of their cars , ( non - gang - related ) imitative shootings , and <MASK> reports of crimes resembling the legend . notable among the last category was a 22 - year - old wisconsin man who in october 2007 <MASK> he had been jumped and beaten by three men after he stopped his car on the shoulder of u . s . 41 because the automobile behind his was repeatedly flashing its headlights at him . a few weeks later , the purported victim was arrested on charges of filing a <MASK> police report after investigators found a witness who said the <MASK> had actually been beaten elsewhere under different circumstances . <PARA> sightings : this legend is key to the plot of the 1998 film urban legend .",

( the mercalli scale is a measurement derived from observable earthquake damage ; the richter scale is based on seismometer readings . the mercalli scale is thus largely a subjective measurement , while the richter scale is generally considered to be more objective and scientifically accurate .) parts of santa monica and the san fernando valley experienced mercalli ix - level intensity , which was <MASK> on the fax as a 9 - level richter scale measurement ( instead of the officially reported 6 . 7 ). <PARA> caltech ( actually the u . s . geological survey at caltech ) had not under - reported the figure \u2014 the northridge quake was a 6 . 7 no matter who measured it . earthquake data is almost instantaneously shared among a number of organizations worldwide , and one group \u2019 s under - reporting the magnitude would have been quickly picked up by the others . even if caltech had wanted to suppress the real numbers , it would have been unable to do so without the cooperation of a number of other scientific organizations . <PARA> the scary fax played into what people wanted to believe . those who \u2019 d lived through the quake swore it had to have been much stronger than the 6 . 7 that was being reported . from this belief was the legend born : if <MORE> it did for reasons other than just the usual mistrust of government and science that marks such whispers . getting up close and personal with the unthinkable heightens the experience , which explains in part why this legend was so widely believed by los angeleans : they \u2019 d been shaken out of bed and back to reality by this earthquake , whereas they had experienced other large quakes that had taken place in other lands merely as words on a page or images on a television screen . in a world where the ruin of the 6 . 9 kobe quake ( 17 january 1995 ) was dispassionately presented by the nightly news and barely given a second thought here in california , what the authorities were telling skeptical los angeleans was a 6 . 7 felt like it was more because it had been experienced with all our senses , not just the television - dulled ones . <PARA> there was yet another reason for this legend \u2019 s running rampant : its location . the quake \u2019 s epicenter was in the heart of the san fernando valley , a heavily - populated area , and so felt stronger to many people because those who experienced the sensation were right on top of the worst of it . additionally , we humans have a desire to star ourselves in the drama of the moment . a 6 . 7 didn \u2019 t sound worthy of the harrowing experience endured by those resident on 17 january 1994 , and those who \u2019 d been through the shake and looked to regale others with their horrific accounts were especially receptive to any suggestion that the figure was far too low . <PARA> on a final note , one further <MASK> attached to fema in california : that illegal immigrants who surfaced to apply for disaster relief would be rounded up , handed over to ins , and deported . that <MASK> did not begin with the northridge quake , however ; it was recorded in the aftermath of the 17 october 1989 loma prieta earthquake in the san francisco area . <PARA> while fema \u2019 s aid is now available only to u . s . citizens , legal residents of the u . s ., and the resident parents of u . s . citizens ( that is , children born in the usa ), at the time of the loma prieta quake , the assistance it directed was available to citizens and non - citizens alike . as for alerting the ins to potential illegals , fema pointed out at that time that it didn \u2019 t ask about the citizenship <MASK> of aid applicants , with questions about citizenship <MASK> not even being presented on any of its forms .

<PARA> [ collected via e - mail , june 2006 ] <PARA> there is possible rumour ( s ) bubbling under in the uk relating to a new tv advert for kellogg \u2019 s frosties . it contains a somewhat \u2018 over the top \u2019 song and dance performance by a teen boy , and has been generating a lot of negative comment on forums in the uk regarding its ability to put off viewers . <PARA> on watching it yesterday my 15 year old son mentioned that he had heard in the playground chatter at school that the \u2018 star \u2019 of the ad was in fact a terminally ill boy who had been granted the appearance as his dying wish . <PARA> <MASK> : in june 2006 we began receiving inquiries about the fate of the adolescent boy who had appeared singing \u201c they \u2019 re gonna taste great \u201d in a uk kellogg \u2019 s frosties commercial that had first aired about a month earlier , ( for those americans not up on their international cereals , frosties are the equivalent of what are known in the u . s . as kellogg \u2019 s frosted flakes , right down to the same cartoon spokestiger .) the soon - to - be - notorious commercial was described by david whitehouse of the guardian as \u201c a jingle being sung by a boy at the exact moment his voice breaks , in a tone so monotonous it appears to be operating at a frequency which toys with people \u2019 s bowels \u201d: <PARA> the frosties spot was so noted for its irritating refrain and ability to annoy that the lad who starred in it reportedly received numerous online death threats , and according to subsequent <MASK> he was beaten or stabbed by hooligans who took it upon themselves to deride him for his role , or was verbally picked on by bullies to the extent that he was moved to take his own life . in this , the most common form of the legend , the boy \u2019 s annoying repetition of \u201c it \u2019 s <PARA> gonna taste great \u201d \u2014 and the equally monotonously - voiced rhyming phrases he delivered throughout the ad \u2014 cost him his life . <PARA> but the <MASK> also took a different form , one that did not have the boy \u2019 s death occur as a consequence of the commercial ( i . e ., he was attacked by others or died by his own hand ). in a secondary form of the legend , a grieving father who had lost his son to cancer succeeded , via the magic of technology , in having his deceased child inserted into the ad as a final <MORE> surname we are concealing to protect his safety , stormed : \u201c can \u2019 t these fools distinguish between me and a character in an ad ?\u201d <PARA> \u201c why would people want to humiliate someone they don \u2019 t even know ?

<PARA> that is the question that has been posited across the u . s . from time to time as <MASK> about \u201c sex bracelets \u201d spread from news market to news market . according to the whispers , the colorful jelly bracelets so beloved of grade - and middle - schoolers convey sexual intent and are used to arrange liaisons of an adult nature . <PARA> jelly bracelets are thin rubbery bands which can be worn \u2014 singly or interconnected \u2014 on the wrists , ankles , or around the neck . they are available in an array of colors , and about $ 3 buys a pack of fifteen , making them <PARA> one of the more reasonably - priced fad items to come along lately . the bands initially acquired sartorial cachet in the 1980s when madonna was seen sporting them , but fashion has its ebbs and flows , so that level of popularity was not maintained and the bracelets lost their appeal for a time . in the late 1990s the bracelets came back into vogue , and they have gained additional <MASK> in the 2000s as everything 80s has become cool again and new pop stars like avril lavigne and pink are seen wearing these baubles . <PARA> recent years have seen several occurrences of administrators in elementary and middle schools banning or warning against the wearing of jelly bracelets by students : <PARA> officials at each of these schools have taken this stance not because the acts signified by various colors are being carried out , but to protect children from premature sexualization . nothing in the various \u201c sex bracelet \u201d news stories we \u2019 ve pawed through indicates girls are actually using these fashion items to declare willingness to engage in various acts , or that boys are breaking girls \u2019 bracelets in the belief that so doing grants them a right to <MASK> what they think has been advertised . rather , the bannings <MORE> leaving them to preserve a particular view of themselves . the concept of being required to have sex would hold certain appeal because such obligation would take the decision out of their hands . the notion that a \u201c sex coupon \u201d could compel them to act out their desires gives them a way to vicariously explore lust while at the same time remaining a \u201c good girl \u201d in that there is no admission ( internal or otherwise ) of sexual hankerings . <PARA> the parents of thirty years ago were not going batty over \u201c sex coupons \u201d the way today \u2019 s parents are over \u201c sex bracelets \u201d because they hadn \u2019 t heard about them . ignorance of their children \u2019 s wacky belief cushioned them in a way that is no longer possible in our current media - saturated world . while it is <MASK> kids of the new millennium have a harder time holding on to their innocence , so too do their parents . <PARA> since we published our <MASK> <MASK> in 2003 , we \u2019 ve heard from hundreds of readers on this topic . the adults who write almost always say their kids are never going to wear those bracelets again ; on the other hand , almost without exception , the middle - and high - school kids from all across the u . s . express shock that adults would think they were actually obeying this \u201c code \u201d and disappointment that their elders fail to understand the bracelets are no more than a cool fashion accessory that has attracted a silly <MASK> . yes , many kids had heard the <MASK> before the media threw it at them ( and many hadn \u2019 t ), but even those exposed to this snippet of lore in the wild ( i . e ., those who heard it from their friends as an item of schoolyard lore rather than gleaned it from the headlines of the day ) received it as nothing more than a giddy \u201c everybody knows \u201d fact , right up there with \u201c bubble yum contains spider eggs .\u201d ( the mechanics of the activity alone might well rule it out : as many of our correspondents have noted , it would take a mighty force to break a jelly bracelet \u2014 those circlets are tough . <PARA> the greatest concern over \u201c sex bracelets \u201d appears not to be that anyone is going to engage in any real redeeming , but that children far too young to be entertaining such thoughts are being exposed to them . one way the pull tab and beer label beliefs differ from the \u201c sex bracelets \u201d code is the age of the participants ; the <MASK> of thirty years ago was circulated mainly in high schools , but today \u2019 s version is moving through grade and middle schools . <PARA> barbara \u201c youth marketed \u201d mikkelson",

        "text": "on 20 october 2015 , the web site the federalist papers shared a meme in a post titled \u201c brutal meme reveals truth about european socialist countries \u201d which included a photograph of a woman and various criticisms about denmark \u2019 s general way of life : <PARA> that meme was something of a rebuttal to an earlier , similar graphic that had lauded denmark \u2019 s social infrastructure : <PARA> ( the woman pictured in both these memes is danish actress mille dinesen , her photograph taken from promotional material for the tv show rita .) <PARA> the text of the \u201c rebuttal \u201d meme began by <MASK> : <PARA> a reliable estimate of the average salary for teachers in denmark is somewhat tricky to calculate due to variables such as tenure and location . however , a 2014 estimate provided an income figure of just under $ 42 , 000 per year for danish teachers ( not $ 61 , 000 ). and it \u2019 s slightly simplistic to say all healthcare is free in denmark , as the cost of medical care varies depending upon residency <MASK> and coverage level . <PARA> the rebuttal also <MASK> that the minimum income tax is 40 % in denmark ( where tax revenue indeed comprised 48 . 6 % of the country \u2019 s gdp in 2013 ). taxpayers in denmark are subject to a progressive tax structure under which total taxes are between 41 to 56 percent of income [ pdf ]: <PARA> another portion of the meme indicated that denmark \u2019 s citizens were \u201c deeply dependent \u201d on welfare to survive , but the country \u2019 s unemployment rate of 6 . 3 % was not much higher than the united <MASK> \u2019 5 . 3 % in the same period . <PARA> the meme continued : <PARA> value - added tax ( vat ) in denmark is indeed 25 %<, though additional \u201c duties and fees \u201d weren \u2019 t specifically described by the meme . gasoline is typically sold by the liter ( not gallon ) in europe overall , and recent estimates provided a cost of $ 1 . 69 per liter in denmark ( or just under $ 6 . 40 a gallon , not $ 10 ). it \u2019 s <MASK> that new cars in denmark are taxed at 180 %, in large part because denmark ( like some other countries ) imposes higher costs of operation for private automobiles to encourage residents to use public transport and more energy - efficient and lower - polluting forms of transportation . <PARA> definitively selecting a single country to <MASK> the title of \u201c highest - taxed \u201d is a slippery endeavor , as the structure of taxation varies significantly from one country to the next . reports on taxes across the globe ( including a popular annual data set released by firm pwc ) almost never declare any one country the most - <MORE> weeks of it ( as well as additional compensated time off totaling about nine days , from which the \u201c six weeks \u201d figure was most likely derived ). denmark \u2019 s parental leave policies are among the most generous in the world , but 52 weeks ( or one year ) is on the upper end of leave with partial or total pay : <PARA> it \u2019 s <MASK> that pension kicks in for danes at age 65 . the <MASK> meme <MASK> that the average american spent $ 8 , 500 per year in deductibles , while the centers for disease control placed average total spending per patient per year at $ 9 , 255 in 2013 . we were unable to find a figure that specifically referenced \u201c deductibles \u201d as a health care expenditure - related metric , but the number cited closely matched world bank figures for per capita health expenditures . <PARA> cited college costs for students in the united <MASK> in the first meme weren \u2019 t exaggerated either : data from 2014 place the yearly cost of tuition at a low of $ 18 , 943 ( for in - <MASK> public schools ) and a high of $ 42 , 419 ( for out - of - <MASK> private schools ). if it \u2019 s surmised that three out of four students attend a local college at the cheaper tuition and one heads off to a private university , the average tuition between those four students would be $ 24 , 812 . <PARA> finally , denmark \u2019 s novel \u201c flexicurity \u201d policy deviates from other european nations \u2019 worker protection policies ( which are unlike american \u201c at will employment \u201d standards ). while danes can be more easily fired than those in other european countries , the country offers robust unemployment insurance compensation to level out labor market fluctuations . <PARA> in short , it \u2019 s <MASK> denmark \u2019 s taxes are far higher than those in the united <MASK> ; but that \u2019 s offset by significantly reduced costs to citizens for expenditures such as healthcare , education , and child care . a gallon of gas doesn \u2019 t cost danes anywhere near $ 10 , but tax on new cars is 180 %. we were unable to find any ranking of denmark as the \u201c highest - taxed \u201d nation in the world ( or even just europe ), and home ownership rates are near what they are in the u . s . ( there are far more privately - owned vehicles in the united <MASK> than denmark , however .) denmark \u2019 s suicide rate is lower than that of the u . s ., and antidepressant usage is higher among americans . finally , while some young danes moved abroad due to high taxes on income , we were unable to find any <MASK> that was the case for companies .",

19 and <MASK> <MASK> billionaire bill gates and the id2020 coalition was behind a grand surveillance plan to microchip the global population ) published on july 4 , 2020 , for example : <PARA> adding to that unsubstantiated concern regarding citizens \u2019 health , a viral web page by a michigan - based blogger alleged that the legislation posed a threat to citizens \u2019 privacy and civil rights . he wrote : <PARA> numerous readers reached out to snopes in july 2020 to investigate the legitimacy of the social media and blog posts regarding the michigan proposal . and upon our analysis of the postings , we deemed the underlying assertion to be this : the michigan house passed legislation that would allow employers to microchip workers on a voluntary basis . <PARA> to fully explore that <MASK> , here \u2019 s important context : only a few u . s .- based companies had publicized the use of radio - frequency identification tags ( rfid ), or microchips , in their workplace at the time of the michigan house \u2019 s vote , and none of them were believed to be in the <MASK> , according to kahle . the technology trend among u . s businesses seemed to have emerged after sweden office complex epicenter began offering rfid microchip implants to employees in 2015 ( we explain more below ). <PARA> so to recap the facts , yes , the michigan house approved a bill governing the use of microchips with a landslide vote , 104 - 2 ( see the bill \u2019 s legislative actions here ), affirming the former aspect of the above - mentioned <MASK> . less simple , however , is the explanation for what the measure aimed to accomplish . <PARA> to unpack that part of critics \u2019 assertion , we reviewed the specifics of the microchip protection act , house bill no . 5672 , which can be read in a pdf format here . the bill comprises five sections , as <MORE> fundamental misconception among people who raised concerns over the michigan proposal : even without the legislation , anyone in the <MASK> can already voluntarily implant themselves with the device or offer the technology to employees . <PARA> wisconsin company three square market , which specializes in vending machines and self - service software for offices , was the first widely known u . s . company to offer the devices to workers , in july 2017 . there , employees can voluntarily get the devices implanted into their hands or use a wristband with the same rfid microchip to make purchases in the company \u2019 s break room and use office equipment , among other things . the microchips use the same near - field communication technology utilized by contactless payment systems such as apple pay . <PARA> in early 2020 , ifeoma ajunwa , a cornell university labor and employment law professor who studies the use of workplace technology , told marketwatch there are likely more american businesses that use the technology , \u201c but they are probably not advertising it .\u201d <PARA> so as the technology becomes more prevalent , <MASK> are enacting new laws to regulate it . as of early 2020 , more than a dozen <MASK> were either considering legislation like the michigan bill that pertains specifically to workers \u2019 rights or were mulling more broad rules to govern the technology , or they had already passed such laws , according to analysis of <MASK> <MASK> on microchipping by the national conference of <MASK> legislatures and lexisnexis , a database of legal research . <PARA> among that minority group of u . s . <MASK> was indiana , for instance , which established a law that took effect july 1 , 2020 . \u201c microchipping is on the rise , and hoosiers need to be aware of their rights ,\u201d said the legislation \u2019 s author , republican rep . alan morrison , before the bill had passed . \u201c it is crucial to take the necessary steps now to ensure more safety and privacy in the future .\u201d <PARA> similarly , kahle , the sponsor of the michigan proposal , said even though the practice was relatively rare as of mid - 2020 , she was attempting to prepare her <MASK> for a future when and if the technology is more popular . she said in a june 24 , 2020 , <MASK> : <PARA> in sum , while it was <MASK> that the michigan house approved legislation governing the use of microchips , it was <MASK> to <MASK> that the bill itself would allow employers to inject the devices \u2014 that practice was not prohibited by existing law and the in - question legislation would not suddenly permit it . rather , the microchip protection act established protections for employees who do not want to use the technology at work . for those reasons , we rate the <MASK> \u201c mostly <MASK> .\u201d",

related offences , and whether she had made similar interventions in any other terrorism - related cases . <PARA> we did not receive a response to those specific questions , but the spokesperson did send us a <MASK> on behalf of rep . omar indicating that she retained her preference for restorative justice and rehabilitation as alternatives to incarceration , in general : <PARA> \u201c throughout her career , rep . omar has supported restorative justice and alternatives to incarceration . it was part of her campaign platform and will continue to be a core tenet of her agenda in congress . she believes everyone has the ability to be rehabilitated . if we truly believe in reforming our criminal justice system , we must reform the way it treats violent , as well as non - violent , offenders . research has shown that this problem is particularly acute for perceived muslim perpetrators . muslim perceived defendants get four times the prison time for foiled ideologically motivated crimes as white supremacists \u2014 even though white supremacist violence accounted for nearly every extremist murder in 2018 . conflating support for a rehabilitative approach to justice with support for the violent acts of offenders \u2014 as many on the right have done \u2014 is shameful and an intentional distortion of her views .\u201d",

( this was back in the pre - vcr days , of course , when watching a <PARA> skin flick didn \u2019 t mean renting one from the local video store and viewing it in the privacy of one \u2019 s bedroom , but making a trip to the local sticky - floored pussycat theater .) based on estimates of the box - office receipts for green door and the resurrection of eve , she earned more than $ 3 million in two years . her life wasn \u2019 t all skittles and beer , though \u2014 she went through a few divorces and battled drug and alcohol addiction before passing away at age 56 in 2009 . <PARA> it \u2019 s interesting to note how this tidbit about marilyn chambers and the ivory snow box is processed by those who come across it . invariably , those who remember chambers being in the shot always cast her as the baby . it \u2019 s that old \u201c innocence transformed into evil \u201d motif \u2014 a pretty girl in a soap ad two years later going on to star in a porn film doesn \u2019 t provide nearly the moral shock factor of an adorable little baby \u2019 s growing up to follow that particular career path . <PARA> ( and to clear up another long - standing <MASK> , no , that baby on the ivory snow box isn \u2019 t actress brooke shields . brooke did appear in some ivory snow advertisements as an infant , but her picture was never used on the box .) <PARA> barbara \u201c 99 44 / 100 % pure \u201d mikkelson <PARA> sightings : in his 1988 humor book \u201c don \u2019 t bend over in the garden , granny , you know them taters got eyes ,\u201d in his description of an incident where he and two friends venture off to see the porn classic behind the green door , lewis grizzard refers to its star as \u201c... who used to be on the cover of a box of soap when she was a baby , but that was a long time ago and marilyn has changed a lot since back then .\u201d",

        "text": "in early february 2017 , various web sites began posting stories regarding a piece of legislation recently passed in the <MASK> of arkansas . those stories were typically published under misleading headlines such as \u201c new arkansas law allows rapists to sue victims seeking abortion \u201d and \u201c arkansas passes law allowing rapists to prevent victims who want an abortion \u201d: <PARA> the law in question , titled the arkansas unborn child protection from dismemberment abortion act , essentially bans what lawmakers term \u201c dismemberment abortions \u201d ( which the medical community refers to as \u201c dilation and evacuation ,\u201d or d & e ) by making the provision of such a procedure a felony crime . although the law precludes family members or rapists from suing pregnant women , it does grant spouses , parents , or legal guardians the ability to sue physicians who perform the procedure for damages and obtain injunctions preventing those physicians from performing additional such procedures . <PARA> jr davis , spokesman for arkansas governor asa hutchinson , pointed to a section of the law that prevents damages from being awarded when a terminated pregnancy was the result of a criminal act : \u201c civil damages shall not be awarded to a plaintiff if the pregnancy resulted from the criminal conduct of the plaintiff .\u201d thus , a rapist cannot sue his victim and reap any benefits from doing so . furthermore , the law excludes a woman \u201c who receives or attempts to receive a dismemberment abortion \u201d from civil liability . <PARA> davis also pointed out that the language in the law doesn \u2019 t enable a woman \u2019 s relatives to halt an abortion ; rather , it allows them to seek an injunction that prevents \u201c the abortion provider from performing or attempting to perform further dismemberment abortions ...\u201d the law , davis said , was geared toward prosecuting physicians who perform the procedure rather than targeting pregnant women . <PARA> the thrust of the law is that it makes it a felony for doctors to perform dilation and evacuation abortion procedures , except in cases where such a procedure is necessary to prevent death or physical maiming of the mother . critics note that the law doesn \u2019 t allow an exception for patients to obtain the specified procedure even in cases of rape or incest . according to davis , the law is \u201c not a prohibition on abortion in the second trimester ,\u201d but rather a restriction on a specific abortion method . <PARA> the aclu , which plans to challenge the law in court , called it \u201c blatantly unconstitutional \u201d because it bans the most common \u2014 and advocates say the safest \u2014 method of abortion in the second trimester of pregnancy . <PARA> bettina brownstein , aclu arkansas co - counsel on the matter , noted in a <MASK> that : <PARA> according to the associated press , the new arkansas law is similar to legislative actions taken by west virginia and mississippi , while related bans in alabama , kansas , louisiana , and oklahoma are on hold due to ongoing legal challenges . <PARA> the bill passed the republican - led arkansas <MASK> senate on 26 january 2017 with a 25 - 6 vote divided largely along party lines , and it was signed by governor hutchinson the next day . the law was slated to go into effect later in 2017 , but a federal judge judge blocked its implementation via preliminary injunction at the end of july .",

( for instance , at baylor university medical center in dallas , a breathing machine for infants reportedly sputtered to a halt when a worker switched on a cellular telephone while medical equipment was being tested , although no baby was attached to the device at the time .) <PARA> another incident reported on the fda web site noted : <PARA> a patient in the intensive care unit was receiving epinephrine by an infusion pump when a visitor received a cell phone call . when the phone was answered , the infusion pump increased the rate of the drip . the patient received an unintended bolus of medication and subsequently developed epinephrine toxicity . <PARA> yet it \u2019 s not clear what the threat level actually is . in march 2007 , mayo clinic researchers published the results of a study in which they attempted to deliberately create interference in medical devices through the use of cell phones : <PARA> researchers at the mayo clinic in rochester , minn ., decided to find out what would happen if they used a cellphone close to some 200 different medical devices . in the first half of [ 2006 ], they used two different models of nokia phone to perform tests in 75 patient rooms at their facility . they also tested two blackberry models . the paper published in the march [ 2007 ] issue of the mayo clinic proceedings says there was no \u201c clinically important interference \u201d when cellphones were used in a \u201c normal \u201d way . <PARA> although some medical care facilities have enacted bans on cell phone usage , others have merely chosen to restrict their use to non - critical parts of the hospital , and some have decided to ignore the whole thing . patients and visitors will not find consistent policies in place in all hospitals and have to rely on signage on the premises ( or lack thereof ) to guide them as to what each facility \u2019 s cell phone policy is . <PARA> as for how seriously those hospitals who have chosen to institute bans on cell phone use within their walls take matters , in 1998 a man in wareham , massachusetts , was arrested in the emergency room of tobey hospital after refusing to end his call . officers twice used pepper spray on him in an effort to relieve him of his phone . <PARA> barbara \u201c assault and peppered \u201d mikkelson",

        "text": "earlier this year , the dazed crew of a japanese trawler were plucked of the sea of japan clinging to the wreckage of their sunken ship . their rescue , however , was followed by immediate imprisonment once authorities questioned the sailors on their ship \u2019 s loss . to a man they <MASK> that a cow , falling out of a clear blue sky , had struck the trawler amidships , shattering its hull and sinking the vessel within minutes . <PARA> they remained in prison for several weeks , until the russian air force reluctantly informed japanese authorities that the crew of one of its cargo planes had apparently stolen a cow wandering at the edge of a siberian airfield , forced the cow into the plane \u2019 s hold and hastily taken off for home . unprepared for live cargo , the russian crew was ill - equipped to manage a now rampaging cow within its hold . to save the aircraft and themselves , they shoved the animal out of the cargo hold as they crossed the sea of japan at an altitude of 30 , 000 feet . <PARA> <MASK> : there is something especially hilarious <PARA> about the mental picture of cows flying through the air ( as a memorable episode of the tv show northern exposure centering on one of the town \u2019 s madcap <PARA> resident \u2019 s plans to catapult a cow as a work of performance art ably demonstrated ). <PARA> this legend about cows dropping from the skies to sink fishing trawlers has been entertaining people for years , and the nationality of the bovine has changed with the tellings , as has that of the ship it supposedly swamped . a 1993 folklore book refers to this <MASK> \u2019 s appearing in the 1 june 1990 moscow news . in that version the cow was brought onto the aircraft as a spur - of - the - moment thing and then driven out of the plane as the colder air at high altitudes caused her to become agitated . a similar <MASK> shows up in a 1983 folklore book and is said to date to around 1965 . in that case the airborne bovine dropped onto the hood of a car in scotland . <PARA> the spring 1996 outbreak of this legend came from the tale being passed from the german embassy in moscow to the foreign ministry in bonn , and someplace betwixt the two transforming itself from apocryphal legend into news <MASK> ; it subsequently appeared as such in german newspapers . perhaps it had something to do with the \u201c falling cow \u201d tale \u2019 s having shown up in a then - recent russian film , osobennosti natsionalnoi okhoty ( peculiarities of the national hunt ). the film depicts hunters stealing a cow and hiding it in a military jet . russians also tell the falling cow <MASK> as a joke , something along the line of the barrel of bricks legend in that the hapless fisherman is trying to explain what happened to his boat but having difficulty getting anyone to believe him . <PARA> further complicating the mess was someone \u2019 s twisting of reuters \u2019 well - researched explanation in april 1996 of how this age - old chestnut had ended up working its way into german newspapers .

        "text": "huma abedin , a u . s .- born muslim of indian and pakistani parentage , has served for more than a decade as a top aide to hillary clinton , though for much of that time was relatively unknown to the american public . all that changed beginning in 2011 when her husband , congressman anthony weiner ( d - new york ), was forced to resign from the u . s . house of representatives due to a sexting scandal , and in 2016 when she was thrust into the limelight by an fbi investigation into hillary clinton \u2019 s use of a private e - mail server while at the <MASK> department . as clinton was running for president at the time , abedin became the target of partisan attacks aimed at weakening her employer \u2019 s candidacy . <PARA> on 24 october 2016 , an eight - and - a - half - minute video was uploaded to the highly - trafficked youtube channel \u201c anonymous \u201d purporting to prove that huma abedin , estranged wife of disgraced former congressman anthony weiner and longtime aide to democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton , has \u201c undeniable ties to terrorists and 9 / 11 funders .\u201d it accrued more than 2 million views in under a week , resulting in a flash - flood of queries about it to our inbox . <PARA> neither the video nor its content was new , however , nor were they created by the hacktivist group anonymous . the video was <MASK> posted on 11 september 2016 to a youtube channel called \u201c leaked uploads .\u201d it , in turn , closely follows the text of an <MASK> posted approximately 10 days before that in a subreddit populated by donald trump supporters . both the text and video appear to have been created by the same individual , a user who goes by the handle \u201c invadepro .\u201d <PARA> here is an excerpt from the text : <PARA> as we mentioned above , none of these allegations are new . we \u2019 ll review the main charges , beginning with abedin \u2019 s biographical information , in a moment , but it \u2019 s worth pointing out at the outset that before she could serve as hillary clinton \u2019 s deputy chief of staff at the <MASK> department , abedin underwent a security clearance requiring , among other things , vetting of her personal and professional <MASK> to establish her loyalty to the united <MASK> and \u201c freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion .\u201d while we would not argue that the clearance process is infallible , nor that information could not subsequently come to light that might change the assessment , we think it likely that the investigators charged with the task have better research tools available to them than does the average internet user . <PARA> it \u2019 s <MASK> that huma abedin was born in kalamazoo , michigan <MORE> is a misrepresentation , according to sources interviewed for a 25 august 2016 <MASK> in the washington post : <PARA> in point of fact , huma abedin never literally worked at the journal of muslim affairs at all , according to a spokesperson for the clinton campaign , who said she was \u201c just a figurehead and not actually on staff .\u201d <PARA> the video attempts to link the abedin family to terrorism via their connection with abdullah omar naseef , a saudi arabian professor who was also secretary - general of the muslim world league between 1982 and 1992 . naseef , who worked ( and still works ) at the same university where syed abedin taught , helped launch the institute of muslim minority affairs , and for a time sat on the advisory board of the journal . the video provides no <MASK> that abdullah omar naseef \u201c funded al - qaeda \u201d or any other terror groups , however . it simply asserts that he did based on his authorization of a refugee relief fund in 1988 that later developed ties with al - qaeda . the washington post explains : <PARA> another dubious connection cited in the video is huma abedin \u2019 s membership in the muslim student association while she attended george washington university . as it happens , two years after abedin graduated and left the university , a young man named anwar al - awlaki arrived , joined that same muslim student association , and served as a school chaplain . al - awlaki , you may recall , was later identified as an al - qaeda recruiter and killed in a u . s . drone strike in 2011 . but the fact that each of them belonged , at different times , to the same campus religious organization does not mean they have anything in common other than being muslim . <PARA> the video also links the national muslim student association to the muslim brotherhood , but apart from the fact that the latter helped establish the former more than 50 years ago , the <MASK> that the two organizations are actively affiliated isn \u2019 t supported by <MASK> . <PARA> most of these allegations first surfaced in 2012 , when michele bachmann and other conservative republicans launched a campaign denouncing \u201c muslim extremists \u201d \u2014 huma adebin among them \u2014 who had supposedly infiltrated the u . s . government . the backlash against these unfounded charges transcended partisanship . among those who condemned bachmann \u2019 s characterization of abedin was then -

        "text": "misinformation spread on the internet in the wake of a rally in portland , oregon , where far - right protesters clashed with counter - demonstrators \u2014 violence that has become a reoccurring feature of the political landscape in the pacific northwest . <PARA> the far - right groups , patriot prayer and \u201c him too ,\u201d held demonstrations on june 29 , 2019 , in downtown portland and were met by counter - protesters , including black - clad anti - fascists . as they have in the past , the events devolved into a series of street brawls . three people were arrested and eight people were injured , including three who were sent to the hospital , according to police . <PARA> right - leaning social media personalities and websites widely circulated an image of a bearded man with blood covering his face , identifying him as john blum and reporting that blum was the victim of a brutal attack by \u201c antifa criminals .\u201d partisan media and a single picture didn \u2019 t tell the full <MASK> , though . <PARA> blum was hit in the head by a black - clad protester , and that injury caused bleeding . but after a widely shared narrative that he was heroically trying to help someone emerged , so did video showing that blum ( wearing a fedora hat ) was both carrying a baton and proactively engaged in a fight . <PARA> the man who shot the videos asked us to use only his first name , john , because of harassment directed at journalists who covered the event . john told us that in the chaos that has periodically roiled portland since the election of president donald trump , some people show up specifically to fight , and the late - june protests were no different . blum had swung his baton at people before getting hit over the head himself . <PARA> \u201c it was just really chaotic ,\u201d john told us . \u201c there was a point where things had calmed down , and then someone threw one more punch , and it turned into another little scuffle . that \u2019 s when the older gentleman ( blum ) came at people who weren \u2019 t attacking him , i think two different people in the black bloc . someone responded by hitting him in the head [ from behind ].\u201d <PARA> john , who identifies himself as an independent media worker sympathetic to the anti - fascists \u2019 cause , said that a sundress - wearing protester was attacked , but blum was not part of that altercation . \u201c it \u2019 s really kind of nuanced and mixed up . the idea that john blum was sticking up for this guy [ in a sundress ] is inaccurate , but there was an attempted attack on [ the person in the sundress ]. john blum was not part of that confrontation .\u201d <MORE> though we are unsure why . we were also unable to locate blum online for comment . <PARA> the misleading victim framework that spread across the right - leaning media ecosystem is no surprise , said stanislav vysotsky , an assistant professor of sociology and criminology at the university of wisconsin at whitewater who has been researching political violence in portland . citing the work of sociologist mitch berbrier , vysotsky told us the \u201c victim \u201d narrative is an established framing technique used on the far right . <PARA> \u201c there is already a master narrative on the far right that they are victims , victims of people of color , of jewish conspiracies , feminists , all these things , so it \u2019 s very easy once you have this framework to paint yourself as a victim of left - wing thugs ,\u201d he told us . <PARA> reality is more complicated , however . he places the most significant starting point for political violence in portland with a june 4 , 2017 , \u201c free speech \u201d rally planned by right - wing patriot prayer founder joey gibson one week after two men were fatally stabbed on a portland train by a white supremacist . the men had been trying to intervene as that white supremacist , identified as jeremy christian , berated two muslim passengers . the rally was scheduled despite the revelation that christian had attended a patriot prayer event , raising tensions . <PARA> since then , multiple incidents have contributed to an overall escalation of violence at various events staged by far - right activists , which draw opposition from counter - demonstrators , including anti - fascists . on may 1 , 2019 , members of the patriot prayer group showed up at cider riot , a bar in portland known to have left - leaning activists as patrons , and sprayed customers with mace , initiating a street fight . one member of gibson \u2019 s group hit a woman with a baton , fracturing a vertebrae , according a lawsuit filed by the bar . <PARA> also in 2017 , vysotsky said , the far - right adopted a new tactic of holding political events in liberal strongholds like seattle and portland to deliberately provoke a response . \u201c that was a shift in the politics of the far right , and this influence of the alt - right and the trolling culture . the protests became increasingly trolling events , where they are coming into the liberal territory basically saying , \u2018 we \u2019 re far right , and we \u2019 re coming into your city , what are you gonna do about it ?'\u201d <PARA> according to the anti - defamation league , \u201c both patriot prayer and proud boys espouse virulently anti - muslim views , are vocally pro - trump , and are known for their deliberate provocations of left - leaning west coast communities .\u201d",

( however , some hollywood pundits maintain that even the milder \u201c barroom brawl \u201d version was a bit of fiction invented by a publicist .) <PARA> mel gibson did direct and star in the man without a face , a 1993 film about a man who became a recluse after his features were disfigured in an automobile accident , but the movie was based upon a novel by isabelle holland , not mel gibson \u2019 s life . <PARA> many of our readers have sworn to us they heard paul harvey recite this piece , exactly as reproduced above , on one of his broadcasts . paul harvey did offer a \u201c rest of the <MASK> \u201d segment about mel gibson on 24 june 2000 , and it was a typically ( for paul harvey ) exaggerated version of the truth , but it didn \u2019 t come close to the glurge reproduced here . what harvey reported , verbatim , was this : <PARA> and now you know ... the real <MASK> . <PARA> the february 2004 release of the film the passion of the christ , financed and directed by mel gibson , started this legend circulating anew , often with tacked - on codas such as the following :",

        "text": "as the coronavirus pandemic struck the u . s . in spring 2020 , <MASK> planned to expand voting by mail ahead of the november presidential election as a safer alternative to in - person polling places . right - wing media and groups have continued to highlight alleged instances of voter fraud in numerous forms over the last few years , and regardless of the veracity behind their <MASK> , this time was no different . u . s . president donald trump heavily criticized the use of mail - in ballots , arguing it would result in voter fraud . <PARA> a similar <MASK> emerged from a report that more than 19 , 000 fraudulent driver \u2019 s licenses had been seized by u . s . customs and border protection ( cbp ) at chicago o \u2019 hare international airport from early 2020 until june 30 . conservative websites latched onto this <MASK> and shared the same post , arguing that the fraudulent licenses would be used to enable record numbers of illegally cast votes through mail - in ballots . one <MASK> on the conservative website of david harris jr ., said : <PARA> snopes readers asked us to investigate <MASK> that these fake driver \u2019 s licenses could result in millions of illegally cast votes for democrats in the november election . but the answer was not as obvious , nor as definitive , as these <MASK> <MASK> . <PARA> the airport \u2019 s cbp confirmed that it seized a total of 19 , 888 counterfeit u . s . driver \u2019 s licenses from the beginning of 2020 to june 30 in a chicago airport . the majority of these shipments arrived from china and hong kong . the licenses were for various people in different <MASK> , and largely for college - aged students . <PARA> some licenses shared the same image , but with different biographical data . in a news release , the cbp said fraudulent documents like these often \u201c lead to identity theft , worksite enforcement , critical infrastructure protection , fraud linked to immigration - related crimes .\u201d <PARA> but while reports of the fraudulent documents were accurate , a cbp spokesperson told snopes that officials had \u201c no <MASK> \u201d that these fake ids could be used by individuals to register to vote , and added they were \u201c not able to speculate on this hypothetical situation .\u201d <PARA> the cbp was also concerned that bar codes \u2014 which contain a digital record of an individual \u2019 s personal information \u2014 on fake michigan ids had been made in such a sophisticated manner that they could successfully pass through a scanner at an establishment such as a bar or restaurant . <PARA> the spokesperson told us : <PARA> snopes reached out to the michigan secretary of <MASK> , which manages the voting process , regarding concerns over these ids . their spokesperson , tracy wimmer , highlighted <MORE> secretaries of <MASK> ( nass ), a body comprised of secretaries of <MASK> who carry out election administration for different <MASK> , told snopes that individuals attempting to vote using a fake driver \u2019 s license or <MASK> id would be flagged , since they wouldn \u2019 t match the <MASK> \u2019 s department of motor vehicles ( dmv ) records . <PARA> voter id laws vary by <MASK> , with a total of 36 <MASK> requesting or requiring some form of identification at the polls , 35 of which are applying these laws in 2020 , with the exception of north carolina . other <MASK> use other methods at the polls , including most frequently verifying voters \u2019 signatures with ones they have on file . many argue that these id laws prevent in - person voter impersonation , even though examples of this kind of fraud are extremely rare . <PARA> thus , it appears to be highly unlikely that the information on a fake license would match exactly with all the other information the government has on file for individuals . <PARA> the above <MASK> posited that these fake licenses would result in millions of votes for democrats through mail - in ballots , an argument that is both far - fetched and difficult to prove in advance of the election . voting by mail and absentee ballots have stringent verification procedures that are similar to those used in the registration process . <PARA> a nass spokesperson told us that for mail voting , signature matches , driver \u2019 s license numbers , and other identifiers must match with voter - registration records already on file . security mechanisms also help prevent double - voting . for example , ballot envelopes are barcoded for individual voters , with election officials only accepting one ballot per voter . <PARA> snopes has previously covered how unlikely it is for fraud to occur through mail - in voting . <PARA> we looked for past examples of fraudulent driver \u2019 s licenses actually being used in the voting process and found a 2008 case from colorado . we were not able to find examples of election officials being fooled by such licenses , however . <PARA> during the 2008 presidential election , a small group of people provided fake license numbers , and officials found voter - registration forms signed by \u201c rip van winkle \u201d and other dubious applicants : <PARA> in summary , we were unable to determine if fake documents were intended to be used in a voter - fraud operation in the u . s ., as some people <MASK> online . but given the security measures in place , and the lack of cases of such fraud occurring , it is highly unlikely that fake ids could be used to plant <MASK> votes . that said , given how little we know definitively ahead of the election , we rate this <MASK> as \u201c unproven .\u201d",

<PARA> yes , as to affecting the treasury \u2019 s cash flow ( but only temporarily ), and no , as to deepening the national debt . social security administration economist david pattison explains : <PARA> <MASK> : social security has a $ 2 . 5 trillion surplus . <PARA> <MASK> , and then some . as of 2017 , social security trust fund reserves stood at $ 2 . 82 trillion , up $ 19 billion from the previous year . in the absence of reforms , the trustees expect to maintain surpluses , albeit gradually declining , through 2034 . <PARA> <MASK> : congress has \u201c borrowed \u201d trillions from social security to pay for government spending . <PARA> <MASK> , but misleadingly <MASK> . as we explained above , the system was set up from day one such that trust fund surpluses must be invested in interest - earning u . s . treasury bonds , in effect lending the monies to the general account for whatever discretionary uses congress sees fit to spend them on . one might argue that there are more practical alternatives , but it \u2019 s misleading to characterize it as an abuse of the system . <PARA> are members of the gop \u201c lying ,\u201d as the facebook meme holds , when they say social security needs to be cut in order to balance the federal budget ? not necessarily , but they \u2019 re painting a distorted picture , purposely or not . in the short term , and minus the implementation of other reforms , cutting social security benefits would only add to the trust funds \u2019 surpluses while cheating beneficiaries of the assistance they \u2019 ve been promised . it wouldn \u2019 t add to the federal budget \u2019 s bottom line . <PARA> without question , changes of some kind will be necessary to keep social security viable decades hence , so there \u2019 s no way around the government \u201c messing \u201d with the system to that end , one way or another .",

that he \u201c wants to \u201d use this form of geoengineering as a tool to fight climate change ; that scopex specifically seeks to test the theory that \u201c spraying <MASK> into the atmosphere \u201d can reduce warming ; and that scientists think scopex itself could produce global unintended consequences . <PARA> such assertions or implications are misleading in several regards described in detail below . briefly , it is <MASK> that gates has funded research that includes theoretical studies into the feasibility of solar radiation management . scopex is one of those projects . it is , however , a mischaracterization to suggest that scopex seeks to test geoengineering per se , that a geoengineered world is a desired outcome for the people involved in the project , or that scopex itself could disturb the global climate system . <PARA> the ultimate point of scopex project is not to dim anything \u2014 scientists do not need to test whether aerosols block sunlight , that fact is already well established \u2014 but instead to release a small amount of the calcium carbonate ( no more than 4 . 4 pounds ) into the wake of a propeller - driven weather balloon flying 12 miles above the arctic , creating a diffuse cloud that is roughly 1000 yards long and 100 yards in diameter . <PARA> the data gathered during this experiment would , among other things , help inform computer models that look into the potential risks of actual geoengineering . these models , the scopex website explains , \u201c are the primary tool for estimating the risks and benefits of solar geoengineering .\u201d to refine these models , scientists need to know how the aerosols interact with the atmosphere on a nanoscale . according to the project \u2019 s website : <PARA> in 2007 , gates created a grant - making research fund known as <MORE> slippery - slope arguments aside , this is a far cry from an attempt to geoengineer the world . <PARA> many anti - gates stories and memes suggest gates philanthropic efforts \u2019 stem from things he \u201c wants \u201d to happen . in terms of solar radiation management , that is not the case . gates argument , as described during a 2010 ted talk , is that humanity should not be in a position , if global warming gets bad enough that geoengineering needs to be taken seriously , where we do not have the research to fully understand the mechanics of that solution : <PARA> as keutsch has pointed out , this is not a fringe view , it is one held by several scientific bodies . in 2015 , the national academies of sciences , for example , released a two - part report on climate interventions like solar radiation management . \u201c if the world cannot slow emissions or the effects of climate change are more extreme or occur sooner than expected , there may be demands to pursue additional climate - intervention technologies about which scientists need a better understanding ,\u201d national academy of sciences president ralph j . cicerone said in a news release for that report .\u201c although riskier ideas to lessen the amount of energy absorbed from the sun should not be considered for deployment , they should be studied so that we can provide answers if someday these ideas begin to be considered in attempts to avert catastrophe .\u201d <PARA> the incremental nature of scopex cannot be <MASK> . the only reason the experiment was in the news in december 2020 , for instance , is because the project found a company to facilitate the launch of a weather balloon . but even this flight \u2014 still months away and pending approval from harvard \u2019 s outside advisory committee \u2014 is only a test of the balloon , and would not release its theoretical payload of just under 3 1 / 2 pounds of calcium carbonate powder . <PARA> further , a diffuse cloud of chalky powder gently perturbed by a propeller - driven weather balloon 12 miles above the arctic is in no way capable of altering the global climate system . headlines or <MASK> to the contrary rely on \u201c slippery slope \u201d arguments about geoengineering in general , not a fear that scopex itself could destroy the world . <PARA> while gates is one of geoengineering research \u2019 s most significant ( at least in financial terms ) champions , his funding of this research does not stem from a desire to implement so - called \u201c last - ditch \u201d solutions . for these reasons , and because scopex does not \u2014 from a factual standpoint \u2014 actually dim or block the sun , we rate the <MASK> that gates is funding research that \u201c would help block out the sun \u201d as \u201c mostly <MASK> .\u201d",

        "text": "examples : [ collected via e - mail , february 2012 ] <PARA> eric bolling ( fox business channel \u2019 s \u201c follow the money \u201d) test drove the chevy volt at the invitation of general motors . <PARA> for four days in a row , the fully charged battery lasted only 25 miles before the volt switched to the reserve gasoline engine . eric calculated the car got 30 mpg including the 25 miles it ran on the battery . so , the range including the 9 gallon gas tank and the 16 kwh battery is approximately 270 miles . it will take you 4 1 / 2 hours to drive 270 miles at 60 mph . then add 10 hours to charge the battery and you have a total trip time of 14 . 5 hours . in a typical road trip your average speed ( including charging time ) would be 20 mph . <PARA> according to general motors , the volt battery holds 16 kwh of electricity . it takes a full 10 hours to charge a drained battery . <PARA> the cost for the electricity to charge the volt is never mentioned so i looked up what i pay for electricity . <PARA> i pay approximately ( it varies with amount used and the seasons ) $ 1 . 16 per kwh . <PARA> \u2013 16 kwh x $ 1 . 16 per kwh = $ 18 . 56 to charge the battery . <PARA> $ 18 . 56 per charge divided by 25 miles = $ 0 . 74 per mile to operate the volt using the battery . <PARA> compare this to a similar size car equipped with only a 4 cylinder gasoline engine that gets 32 mpg . <PARA> \u2013 $ 3 . 19 per gallon divided by 32 mpg = $ 0 . 10 per mile . <PARA> the gasoline powered car cost about $ 15 , 000 while the volt costs $ 46 , 000 . <PARA> so obama wants us to pay 3 times as much for a car that costs more that 7 times as much to run and takes 3 times as long to drive across country . <PARA> really ? no wonder gm is having trouble selling the volt ! <PARA> <MASK> : in february 2012 , eric bolling did test drive a chevy volt and report on his experience for fox news , noting ( among other factors ) that the volt took 12 hours to charge and ran for only about 25 miles before discharging the battery and switching over to the gasoline engine , aspects he found particularly disappointing for an automobile that cost $ 46 , 500 and was heavily subsidized with taxpayer money : <PARA> however , this criticism somewhat misses the mark , as the chevy volt is not intended to be a car drivable for long distances in electric vehicle ( ev ) mode : it \u2019 s a <MORE> electric - range figure for the volt was not an average mileage figure , but rather the product of worst - case scenario driving : <PARA> gm \u2019 s recently revised electric - range <MASK> is 25 to 50 miles , and we ended up in the low to middle of that band . getting on the nearest highway and commuting with the 80 - mph flow of traffic \u2014 basically the worst - case scenario \u2014 yielded 26 miles ; a fairly spirited back - road loop netted 31 ; and a carefully modulated cruise below 60 mph pushed the figure into the upper 30s . <PARA> additionally , the figures given for the chevy volt above are calculated using a price of $ 1 . 16 per kwh ( kilowatt hour ) of electricity . although electricity costs vary from place to place , nowhere in the united <MASK> is the average residential <PARA> retail price of electricity anywhere close to $ 1 . 16 per kwh . the average consumer price for electricity in the united <MASK> in december 2011 was only $ 0 . 127 per kwh . using that average price as a baseline and factoring in the proper amount of battery charging time ( while maintaining a worst - case scenario mileage assumption ), the <MASK> figures work out as follows : <PARA> 13 . 4 kwh x $ 0 . 127 per kwh = $ 1 . 70 to charge the battery . <PARA> $ 1 . 70 per charge divided by 25 miles = $ 0 . 07 per mile to operate the volt using the battery . <PARA> $ 1 . 70 per charge divided by 25 miles = $ 0 . 07 per mile to operate the volt using the battery . <PARA> the national average price of a gallon of gasoline in the united <MASK> in february 2012 was $ 3 . 565 , quite a bit more than the $ 3 . 19 per gallon figure cited above , so using current average costs , the comparison to a conventional gasoline - powered automobile would work out as follows : <PARA> compare this to a similar size car equipped with only a 4 cylinder gasoline engine that gets 32 mpg . <PARA> $ 3 . 565 per gallon divided by 32 mpg = $ 0 . 11 per mile . <PARA> $ 3 . 565 per gallon divided by 32 mpg = $ 0 . 11 per mile . <PARA> so , according to the criteria used by the author of this item , rather than being a car that \u201c costs more than 7 times as much to run and takes 3 times as long to drive across country \u201d than a gasoline - powered 4 - cylinder car , the volt costs about one - third less to run ( in electric mode ) and takes the same amount of time to drive across country .",

        "text": "<MASK> : \u201c how did you guys meet ?\u201d is a question commonly posed to couples , and the answers may range from a mundane \u201c oh , we met at work \u201d or \u201c we were introduced by a mutual friend \u201d to a comical or bizarre one - in - a - million chain of coincidences that brought two strangers together . yet for all the variegated responses this question might possibly elicit , the <MASK> <MASK> above suggests that by far the most common response is an ordinary and simple one : the overwhelming majority of married couples ( 90 %) <MASK> met and established an initial romantic <PARA> relationship during their secondary school ( i . e ., junior high or high school ) years . <PARA> but is this <MASK> accurate ? it might have been <MASK> ( or closer to <MASK> ) in an earlier era , when people tended to marry younger , when a larger percentage of the population lived in rural areas and / or spent most of their lives close to their birthplaces , and when the opportunities for meeting and mingling with members of the opposite sex after the completion of high school were limited by more restrictive social mores and a more rigid separation of the sexes in the areas of employment and post - secondary education . however , we could find no <MASK> documenting that the cited 90 % figure is ( or was ) <MASK> any time in the last few decades , at least for the united <MASK> . <PARA> <MASK> about how married couples met vary from year to year ( and survey to survey ), but studies in recent years have consistently reported that more couples met through family or friends , at college , at work , or online than in secondary school . for example : <PARA> according to a harris interactive online survey of more than 10 , 000 people who married in the us during an 18 - month period in 2006 and 2007 , nineteen per cent of the couples met online , compared with 17 per cent who met at work and 17 per cent who met through friends . in contrast , a similar poll of almost 5000 couples who married between september 2004 and august 2005 found that 14 per cent met online , compared with 20 per cent at work and 17 per cent through friends . <PARA> another harris interactive survey conducted in january 2006 asked respondents who were currently involved in relationships ( although not necessarily married ) \u201c how did you meet your current partner ?\u201d and compiled the following results . note that the \u201c school \u201d category , even though it encompassed both secondary school and college , was the answer given by only 14 % of the total respondent base : <PARA> even allowing for some potential biases in survey methods ( e . g ., online surveys might target a greater preponderance of people who met online than other survey methods would ), it seems clear from these and similar studies conducted since the early 1990s that nowhere close to 90 % of u . s . marriages are matches between people who were secondary school sweethearts . <PARA> one of our favorite \u201c how they met \u201d stories ( <MASK> or not ) is the following , told of former major league baseball player cal ripken jr .: <PARA> about two months later , a young woman approached him and said , \u201c thanks for being so nice to my mom .\u201d <PARA> cal replied , \u201c oh , are you kelly ?\u201d <PARA> she was , and now she \u2019 s mrs . ripken .",

        "text": "rarely does a month go by without the emergence of a new internet meme comparing the presidencies of donald trump and barack obama , typically favoring the former over the latter . <PARA> in july 2018 , we were alerted to a meme declaring that while president trump donates all of his salary and first lady melania trump makes do with a small white house staff of four people , president obama donated none of his salary and first lady michelle obama surrounded herself with a large staff of 23 attendants . \u201c in life there \u2019 s givers and takers ,\u201d the post concluded . it was straightforward , to the point , and grossly misleading all at the same time : <PARA> as for president trump \u2019 s donating all of his presidential salary ( as he promised to do during his campaign ), to date that is an accurate <MASK> . we reported previously that trump has so far written a personal check each quarter in an amount equivalent to one - fourth of his annual salary to the following federal agencies : the national park service , the department of education , the department of health and human services , the department of transportation , the department of veterans affairs , the national institute on alcohol abuse and alcoholism , and the department of homeland security . <PARA> former president barack obama , on the other hand , did not convert his entire presidential salary into donations ( nor did he promise to ), but it \u2019 s <MASK> to say he donated \u201c none \u201d of it . according to forbes , president obama donated some $ 1 . 1 million ( an amount representing 34 % of the $ 3 . 2 million aggregate salary he received over eight years in office ) to charitable causes during his term in office . this is a partial accounting of those donations : <PARA> president obama also more than doubled that charitable total by also donating the entire $ 1 . 4 million he received as the winner of the 2009 nobel peace prize to ten different organizations : <PARA> taken together , all those donations represented more than 78 % of the total salary president obama was paid during his time in the white house . <PARA> although president obama \u2019 s donations may have amounted to a lesser percentage of his presidential salary than the 100 % president trump is projected to donate over the course of his presidency , the comparison is a lopsided one unless one takes into account that trump entered office with a reported net worth in the multi - billions , while the obamas \u2019 combined wealth was a bare fraction of that . trump didn \u2019 t need his presidential salary , and he said as much \u2014 before trump took office , the only presidents who had donated their entire salaries were john f . kennedy and <MORE> michelle obama had an \u201c unprecedented \u201d number of staffers working for her , but in fact her staff , which totaled between 22 and 24 employees , was comparable in size to that of laura bush during the final year of the george w . bush administration . ( and their staffs paled beside those of lady bird johnson and betty ford , each of whom had around 30 employees , and jackie kennedy , who reportedly had about 40 .) <PARA> things get more complicated when it comes to melania trump . for one thing , she didn \u2019 t move into the white house until 11 june 2017 , five months into her husband \u2019 s presidency . for another , she was far less active during her inaugural year as first lady than her immediate predecessors . <PARA> does melania trump have a smaller staff than michelle obama ? yes , but the disparity is smaller than alleged . the <MASK> that she only has four staff members is based on the 2017 annual report to congress on white house office personnel . that report does list exactly four staff members whose titles link them directly to the first lady , but it is neither a full nor a current count , for the following reasons : <PARA> first , the report was published on 1 july 2017 , only slightly more than two weeks after melania trump moved into the east wing . her staff was skeletal then , at best . <PARA> second , if we apply the same criteria used to arrive at a count of michelle obama \u2019 s staff , at least two employees who aren \u2019 t directly linked to the first lady by title must also be included : special assistant to the president / white house social secretary , and deputy social secretary . those positions alone bring the total size of melania trump \u2019 s staff in her first two weeks in the white house to six . <PARA> lastly , for whatever reasons , the annual reports to congress don \u2019 t list the first lady \u2019 s entire staff . for example , in january 2018 melania hired three new employees , but only one of those is accounted for in the 1 july 2018 report . <PARA> <MASK> made to the press by the first lady \u2019 s communications director , stephanie grisham ( who did not respond to our request for an updated list ), indicated melania trump \u2019 s staff numbered nine employees as of october 2017 . her three new hires in january 2018 would have brought that total to 12 staffers \u2014 a total still lower than michelle obama \u2019 s , but triple the mere four <MASK> of her . <PARA> the meme under discussion , therefore , deploys inaccurate numbers and misleading comparisons to portray the trumps as \u201c givers \u201d and the obamas as \u201c takers .\u201d",

<PARA> please be advise , \u201c top pop \u201d & \u201c tropical fantasy \u201d . 50 sodas are being manufactured by the klu .. klux .. klan . <PARA> sodas contain stimulants to sterilize the black man , and who knows what else !!!! <PARA> they are only put in stores in harlem and minority areas . you won \u2019 t find them down town .... look around .... <PARA> you have been warned <PARA> please save the children <PARA> please be advise , \u201c top pop \u201d & \u201c tropical fantasy \u201d . 50 sodas are being manufactured by the klu .. klux .. klan . <PARA> sodas contain stimulants to sterilize the black man , and who knows what else !!!! <PARA> they are only put in stores in harlem and minority areas . you won \u2019 t find them down town .... look around .... <PARA> you have been warned <PARA> please save the children <PARA> two aspects of tropical fantasy \u2019 s marketing contributed to the belief that the drink would provide an excellent vehicle to slip a noxious substance to african - americans : where the beverage was being sold , and the product name itself . most of the retail outlets vending the drink were located in the inner city areas densely populated with african - americans . there were no marketing campaigns other than store displays , a practice which rendered the product almost invisible to consumers not living in such areas . and the \u201c tropical \u201d portion of the name led some to believe that these fruit - flavored drinks were from the tropics , the place of <MASK> of any number of <MORE> , business rivals were not at the bottom of it . but that is not the case here : the bottlers of tropical fantasy have in fact amassed an impressive amount of <MASK> which suggests that if their competitors did not launch the <MASK> , they might well have actively perpetrated it . <PARA> tropical fantasy is not the only product to have had the sterilization <MASK> tied to its tail . church \u2019 s fried chicken experienced a similar fate . <PARA> non - blacks first encountering the <MASK> might wonder at how widely the canard was believed , because they are intially struck by the implausibility of the <MASK> . folklorist patricia turner provides this answer : <PARA> to those outside the <MASK> \u2019 s public , the mechanism of contamination makes the accusation seem highly implausible . i encountered very few white informants who were familiar with the <MASK> . upon hearing a summary , most responded by asking , \u201c how is this mysterious substance supposed to distinguish between white male eaters and black male eaters ?\u201d when this question is posed to blacks , a common explanation is that most church \u2019 s franchises are located in black neighborhoods . similarly , those who believe tropical fantasy <MASK> note that the beverage is sold in inner - city ma - and - pa grocery stores , not at downtown soda counters . hence , the kkk runs very little risk of sterilizing white male consumers . other informants suggest that a substance has been discovered that impedes the production of sperm in black males but is harmless when consumed by whites . <PARA> as to why the <MASK> was believed as deeply as it was , lorraine hale , a psychologist who is president of hale house foundation , a philanthropy for drug addicts \u2019 babies , women with aids , and formerly drug - addicted mothers and their children , had this to say : <PARA> having come from a slavery background , where we were so brutalized for so long , the sense of fear we have as a people is very real . there \u2019 s a mass paranoia that the objective here is to kill us out as easily and quickly as possible . we don \u2019 t articulate it , but we act upon it . <PARA> such deep - rooted fears often surface as watchfulness , caution , and suspicion among african - americans , and they can easily generate enough doubt to bring into question the contents of a soft drink . those not from a similarly mistrustful backgrounds will likely have difficulty grasping why belief in a <MASK> that was so obviously <MASK> could have reached the level of hysteria that it did , but only because the cultures they emerged from lack a comparable streak of skepticism about the safety of the world in which they live . <PARA> barbara \u201c whirled of difference \u201d mikkelson",

mail , april 2005 ] <PARA> curiously , an invention left off [ a list of black inventors ] is perhaps the most distinctive of its kind , the mccoy automatic lubricator ( us pat # 129 , 843 ). elijah mccoy invented an entirely new class of machinery improvement , being the very first time a railroad locomotive could be continuously lubricated while in motion . variations were used on virtually every steam locomotive built since . the mccoy device was so popular that a number of inferior knockoffs appeared on the market \u2013 leading master mechanics of the railroads to specify the genuine <MASK> \u2013 the \u201c real mccoy .\u201d <PARA> <MASK> : while most folks instinctively grasp the meaning of the phrase \u201c the real mccoy \u201d ( the genuine <MASK> , as opposed to an imitation ), no one has the definitive answer as to where that peculiar expression came from . <PARA> there are a number of competing theories as to who or what was \u201c the real mccoy \u201d: <PARA> the saying \u2019 s recorded <MASK> is murky , but while there is no indisputable <MASK> for the term , one theory ( which actually combines two of the above elements ) does stand far above the rest . <PARA> while the earliest verified print sighting of \u201c the real mccoy \u201d dates to 1908 , the first surfacing of the phrase it likely stemmed from was noted in 1856 : \u201c a drappie o \u2019 the real mckay ,\u201d referring to a brand of whisky produced in scotland . said brand of hooch subsequently came to be advertised under the slogan \u201c the real mckay \u201d in 1870 , thereby exposing an even greater number of scots to its existence . <PARA> over time , other sightings into which misspellings had crept were noted : <PARA> ( the item being described as \u201c mccoy \u201d in this sighting was whisky .) <PARA> these two points ( misspellings creeping in plus the first mccoy sighting being about whisky ) somewhat work to support the theory that the scottish advertising slogan \u201c the real mckay \u201d became a tad garbled as it crossed the ocean into the u . s . <PARA> yet however it got there , once it had arrived in the new land , it subsequently came to be associated with a boxer of some fame , thereby greatly increasing its spread . <PARA> norman selby , better known <PARA> as kid mccoy , was the american welterweight champion in 1896 . as he gained weight , he moved up into the middleweight class , and during his career fought many notable heavyweights . <MORE> u . s ., with its \u201c mckay \u201d becoming \u201c mccoy \u201d in the process , with the saying subsequently further popularized through confusion between a popular boxer of the day ( kid mccoy ) and the saying ( the real mccoy ). <PARA> of the many other potential <MASK> for the phrase , while some contain elements that are rooted in <MASK> ( there was a black inventor by name of elijah mccoy who did invent a revolutionary device that allowed for the oiling of machines while in operation , and there was a famous cattle baron of the name of joseph g . mccoy ), most are not . if addicts ever referred to heroin as \u201c the real macao ,\u201d we \u2019 ve yet to encounter an instance of it . likewise , there \u2019 s little reason to suppose that a pennsylvania wildcatter named mccoy was selling nitroglycerin swiped from job sites to safecrackers . nelson mccoy pottery wasn \u2019 t founded until 1910 which , given the 1908 \u201c real mccoy \u201d sighting , puts it out of the running . <PARA> of the three less credible purported explanations that involve real people , although there was a famous cattle baron called joseph g . mccoy , it \u2019 s unlikely he was confused with anyone else , thereby requiring him to self - identify as \u201c the real mccoy .\u201d <PARA> likewise , while the oiler invented by elijah mccoy amounted to a startling development in its time , it does not appear to have been competing with copycats , thereby leaving buyers clamoring for \u201c the real mccoy .\u201d also , it was a specialized piece of equipment , which means its pool of potential purchasers was very small . it is therefore not believable that widespread consumer insistence upon having the mccoy oiler and no other created the phrase . <PARA> similarly , while there was a prohibition - era rum runner named bill mccoy , even if the booze he had been vending had been of the highest quality , he could not have been the mccoy celebrated in the saying , given that the line has been documented back to 1908 , whereas prohibition did not begin in the u . s . until 1920 . <PARA> for the saying to not only have taken root but survived for more than a century , it had to have caught the public \u2019 s imagination in its infancy rather than been merely a catchphrase within a small specialized area . a phrase first recorded as used in reference to whisky in 1856 then enshrined as a particular brand of firewater \u2019 s official slogan in 1870 fits the bill in ways the other proffered explanations do not , especially if it were given a further boost via being confused with the nickname of a well -

        "text": "just three years shy of the 400th anniversary of the legendarily peaceful meal shared by members of the mashtree wampanoag tribe with newly - arrived pilgrims in an event that has since been commemorated as thanksgiving , descendants of those same native americans protested in the u . s . capital against a variation on a sad historical theme . <PARA> after being promised that 321 acres of their ancestral land would be preserved in trust , the tribe saw their hopes dashed when the trump administration reversed course from its predecessor . <PARA> the mashpee wampanoag tribe is currently suing the federal government because the department of the interior ( doi ) on 7 september 2018 reversed an obama - era decision to put 321 acres of land in trust on behalf of the tribe . although the final outcome rests on a court \u2019 s interpretation of whether the tribe was under \u201c federal jurisdiction \u201d according to a 1934 law , the land is viewed by the indigenous community as their means to future self - determination . <PARA> thus , as many americans planned for a thanksgiving feast , tribe members and their supporters marched on the u . s . capitol protesting the decision , which they say could cost them lands the tribe has lived on for 12 , 000 years . <PARA> in an op - ed for the boston globe explaining the community \u2019 s plight , tribal council vice chairwoman jessie little doe baird wrote : <PARA> according to court documents , the situation stemmed from a years - long battle in which the tribe \u201c sought to address its landlessness \u201d and petitioned the doi \u201c to acquire in trust approximately 170 acres of land in mashpee , massachusetts , and approximately 150 acres near taunton , massachusetts .\u201d <PARA> the tribal community planned to use the land for \u201c self - determination and self - governance \u201d as well as housing , education , and cultural preservation . they also wanted to ensure the preservation of an ancestral burial ground and develop land in taunton for an indian gaming facility \u201c with revenues intended to support the mashpee tribal government and meet the needs of tribal members ,\u201d court documents <MASK> . <PARA> mashpee wampanoag members received happy news on 18 september 2015 when they were informed the federal government would acquire 151 acres in taunton and 170 in mashpee and hold the land in trust for the tribe . but some east taunton residents filed suit over the issue in 2016 , and a federal court sided with the residents against the tribe , holding that the interior department did not have the authority to take land in trust for the tribe in the manner they did . <PARA> both parties appealed that decision , but in 2017 the u . s . justice department dropped their participation in the appeal , leaving the mashpee wampanoag to contest the issue on their own . then on 7 september 2018 , the doi issued a decision that reversed their previous one , finding that the mashpee wampanoag were not eligible to have land held in federal trust for them because they didn \u2019 t meet the criterion of having been considered \u201c under federal jurisdiction \u201d in 1934 , the year the indian reorganization act ( ira ) was passed , a <MASK> paramount to a tribe \u2019 s receiving land in trust . <PARA> the tribe then asked the court for a stay of their <MASK> appeal of the taunton plaintiffs \u2019 lawsuit while they pursued a separate lawsuit against the doi to compel that agency to set aside their decision declaring the tribe ineligible to be granted land in trust . <PARA> \u201c in its decision , the department failed to apply established law , contorting some of the relevant facts and ignoring others to engineer a negative decision ,\u201d the tribe \u2019 s lawsuit <MASK> . \u201c as a result the department \u2019 s decision is arbitrary , capricious and contrary to law , and if left unaddressed , will have a <MASK> impact on the tribe .\u201d <PARA> interior department officials ultimately determined that the tribe was not under federal jurisdiction in 1934 , while the mashpee wampanoag contend they submitted \u201c mounds of <MASK> \u201d documenting that they were indeed under federal jurisdiction before 1934 . on 20 november 2018 , the doi asked the court for a 31 - day extension on a deadline to respond to the tribe \u2019 s lawsuit <PARA> even if the mashpee wampanoag were to prevail in their lawsuit against the doi , they would still have to succeed in their appeal of the taunton lawsuit holding that the land was improperly acquired by the interior department in the first place . on 9 october 2018 , the plantiffs \u2019 attorney filed a request arguing that the tribe should not be granted another stay in the appeal process . <PARA> in her op - ed , baird noted that although her ancestors shared a peaceful meal with pilgrims , the <MASK> often told about the <MASK> thanksgiving leaves out a less heartwarming aspect of american <MASK> :",

        "text": "on 30 july 2017 , the conservative truth division web site reported that the united <MASK> \u2019 national debt had fallen to a \u201c surprising \u201d extent in the seven months since the inauguration of president donald trump : <PARA> we have checked these numbers and set them in context , and found that the national debt did indeed fall by $ 102 billion between 20 january and the end of july 2017 . this decline is also historically remarkable , in both absolute and percentage terms . this six - month fall in the national debt is also significant when measured against the size of the overall economy . <PARA> national debt \u2014 the basics <PARA> the national debt is , in brief , the total value of what the federal government owes , and is made up of accumulated annual deficits ( when the government spends more than it receives in taxes and other income ). it is made up of \u201c public debt \u201d and \u201c intragovernmental holdings .\u201d public debt is , essentially , debt held by sources outside the central government . intragovernmental holdings are debts between agencies within the federal government , in the form of government trust funds , such as social security trust funds . <PARA> national debt \u2014 the numbers <PARA> according to figures published by the treasury department \u2019 s bureau of fiscal services on the treasurydirect web site , the national debt was $ 19 . 84 trillion on 27 july 2017 ( not 30 july , as <MASK> by truth division . on 20 january , it was $ 19 . 95 trillion . <PARA> that shows a fall of $ 102 . 37 billion , or 0 . 51 percent , over a period of 131 business days . to set that in context , we analyzed national debt data stretching back to 12 july 1993 , and examined every 131 - day period in the last 24 years . you can download a spreadsheet containing all the relevant data here . <PARA> debt - to - gdp ratio <PARA> the national debt , however , is best viewed with reference to the overall economy . if two countries have about the same national debt , the one with the smaller economy will likely be more constrained in its spending , whereas the larger economy \u2014 despite having the same level of debt \u2014 will be less affected in terms of economic and fiscal policy . <PARA> a good way of checking this is to compare the size of the debt to the size of the economy , measured as gdp ( gross domestic product ). gdp is the combined market value of all goods and services produced in a given jurisdiction ( in this case , the united <MASK> ). this comparison between the size of the national debt and the size of the economy is known as the debt - to - gdp ratio . <MORE> this spreadsheet , but here \u2019 s what our estimates revealed : <PARA> causes <PARA> the truth division , a conservative , openly pro - trump web site , clearly attributes this decline in the national debt to the president , <MASK> he and his administration are \u201c undoing the government \u2019 s rampant spending \u201d and \u201c keeping his promises regarding fiscal responsibility \u201d. however , the <MASK> does not cite any examples of actions taken by donald trump which would support this conclusion . <PARA> jared bernstein , a senior fellow at the center on budget and policy priorities and former economic adviser to vice president joe biden , dismissed any <MASK> that president trump is responsible : <PARA> instead , bernstein told us , the cause of the drop in the debt is simple \u2014 the federal debt ceiling that has been in place since march 2017 . <PARA> eventually , bernstein says , the debt ceiling will have to be lifted , and the payments that had been delayed will cause the national debt to increase once again . <PARA> that pattern can be seen in this chart , which shows the national debt from january 2011 up to the end of july 2017 . there are four flat lines showing four periods during which the debt ceiling was frozen : from may to august 2011 ; may to october 2013 ; march to october 2015 ; and the ongoing period since march 2017 . <PARA> conclusion <PARA> the truth division <MASK> accurately describes the extent to which the national debt fell between the inauguration of donald trump in january 2017 and the end of july of the same year . and it rightly describes this fall as \u201c surprising \u201d, since it ranks among the very largest 131 - day declines in the national debt since july 1993 , both in absolute and percentage terms . <PARA> similarly , the decline in both components of the national debt \u2014 public debt and intragovernmental holdings \u2014 was highly significant between 20 january and 27 july 2017 , both in absolute and percentage terms , and as we have shown , the national debt has fallen by an estimated 2 . 25 percent since inauguration day \u2014 even when measured against the size of the overall unites <MASK> economy . whether or not any actions or decisions made by donald trump have caused or contributed to these historically remarkable declines in the debt is a question that goes beyond the scope of this particular fact check . <PARA> unfortunately , the national debt resumed its upward march in august 2017 and by mid - august 2018 stood at about $ 21 . 3 trillion ( up $ 1 . 4 trillion since inauguration day ), so the early 2017 drop has not proved to be a long - term trend . <PARA> a spreadsheet containing all the data relevant to this <MASK> can be downloaded here .",

[ emphasis added ].\u201d <PARA> in those tweets , trump clearly indicated that continued federal financial assistance to california ( specifically to newsom ) would be contingent upon <MASK> officials changing their approach to forest management . that constituted a threat to withdraw federal aid to california for wildfires , and newsweek was right to describe it as such . <PARA> in august 2019 , the russian government published a <MASK> about a phone call between trump and putin on july 31 . that <MASK> read as follows : <PARA> \u201c vladimir putin had a telephone conversation with us president donald trump this evening at the american side \u2019 s initiative . the us president offered help in putting out wildfires in siberia . the president of russia expressed sincere gratitude for the kind attention and the offer of help and assistance . vladimir putin said he will accept the offer if it becomes necessary . he also told his american colleague that a powerful group of aircraft had been formed in siberia to fight the wildfires . according to the emergencies ministry , solutions have been found to problems with the refuelling and deployment of airplanes and helicopters . <PARA> \u201c the president of russia regards the us president \u2019 s offer as a sign that it is possible that full - scale bilateral relations will be restored in the future . the presidents of russia and the united <MASK> agreed to continue contacts in the form of telephone conversations as well as personal meetings .\u201d <PARA> we asked the white house whether they could corroborate , even broadly , the russian government \u2019 s characterization of the call . unfortunately , we did not receive a response . <PARA> at the time , a white house spokesperson did not contradict that version of events and told news outlets that , during his conversation with putin , trump had \u201c expressed concern over the vast wildfires afflicting siberia .\u201d this characterization , combined with the russian description of an offer to help , means it \u2019 s perfectly plausible that trump did make such an offer . <PARA> we found confirmation that he did in a video of an aug . 1 press conference during which trump said the following when reporters asked him about the phone call : <PARA> \u201c mostly we discussed the forest fires in siberia , and other parts of russia . and i said , look , we have the greatest equipment , if we could help you let us know . large sections are burning , and so i said to president putin , if we can help you , let me know .\u201d",

        "text": "in the spring of 2018 , president donald trump announced he would be imposing tariffs on more than 1 , 300 types of products imported from china . the move brought significant scrutiny , including <MASK> that clothing had been excluded from the list of taxed products in order to benefit the president \u2019 s daughter and adviser ivanka trump , whose clothing line has in the past sold products manufactured in china . ( a few months later , ivanka trump said she would be closing down her clothing company .) <PARA> in july 2018 , various news accounts reported that in anticipation of the implementation of those tariffs , customers in the united <MASK> and elsewhere were ramping up their orders for one chinese - made product in particular : president trump re - election campaign items . <PARA> the reports gave rise to speculation that not only was the president \u2019 s re - election campaign itself ordering campaign items produced in china rather than in the u . s ., but that they were attempting to mitigate against the increased costs that would come with the tariffs by pushing for the quick completion of those materials \u2014 moves that would provide a double dose of irony for a politician who has famously emphasized prioritizing american jobs and manufacturing . <PARA> some news reports contained ambiguous phrasing which created the impression ( without explicitly <MASK> such ) that the trump campaign had ordered the production of chinese - made campaign flags . for example , the new york post described materials being manufactured in chinese factories as \u201c trump \u2019 s re - election banners ,\u201d while usa today called them \u201c trump \u2019 s 2020 banners .\u201d <PARA> elle magazine similarly described the merchandise as \u201c trump \u2019 s 2020 re - election flags ,\u201d while adding a <MASK> about the identity of the customer who actually ordered them : \u201c while it is not confirmed that trump \u2019 s campaign ordered the flags , who else besides sean spicer is really that hype about the dude ?\u201d <PARA> on 27 july , vermont senator and 2016 presidential candidate bernie sanders was more direct and explicit in accusing both the president himself and his campaign of having ordered the chinese - made banners and flags . in a facebook post , sanders described the items as \u201c flags for president trump \u2019 s campaign \u201d and accused the president of \u2018 opting for \u2019 cheap foreign labor : <PARA> trump 2020 merchandise \u2014 made in china <PARA> in a 3 july 2018 interview with national public radio ( npr ), li jiang , a factory owner in china \u2019 s zhejiang province , said that \u201c we also make flags for trump for 2020 ,\u201d but this comment was ambiguous about whether the merchandise was ordered by the trump campaign itself . <PARA> on 19 july 2018 , the <MASK> - run chinese newspaper the global <MORE> had faced an increased volume of orders for flags bearing the campaign slogans \u201c trump 2020 \u201d and \u201c keep america great .\u201d <PARA> both the reuters and agence france - presse ( afp ) news agencies reported on a fourth factory , this one in china \u2019 s anhui province , which had been pumping out trump 2020 flags and banners at a higher rate than usual , with reuters <MASK> a factory manager as <MASK> that her \u201c buyers are located in both china and abroad \u201d and that \u201c she doesn \u2019 t know if they are affiliated with trump \u2019 s official campaign or the republican party \u201d: <PARA> both reuters and afp included clear photographic and video <MASK> in their reports , so it \u2019 s clear that trump 2020 merchandise ordered by someone was being produced in at least one chinese factory as of july 2018 : <PARA> none of the chinese factory owners and managers <MASK> in the july 2018 news reports either affirmed or denied that the trump campaign itself had been responsible for the significant increase in orders in recent months , and none of them identified anyone else as being a major customer , so we do not know who was behind orders for the many thousands of \u201c trump 2020 \u201d flags produced in china in the first half of 2018 . <PARA> a trump campaign spokesperson firmly rejected any speculation or allegations linking the campaign to the merchandise . in a <MASK> sent to us by the trump 2020 campaign , michael glassner , chief operating officer of the donald j . trump for president committee , wrote : <PARA> we searched federal election commission records on spending by three trump - related political committees since 2017 and found no <MASK> of flags , banners , or other campaign merchandise being ordered from entities based in china . if such orders had been placed , it is possible that they may have been recorded as disbursements to third parties or subcontractors , but we found no <MASK> that this had taken place . <PARA> conclusion <PARA> it \u2019 s clear that trump 2020 merchandise is being produced in chinese factories , and it \u2019 s reasonable to conclude that the future implementation of tariffs on chinese imports has prompted something of a surge in orders , as recounted by several local factory officials . <PARA> the volume of the orders ( 90 , 000 banners between march and july , at just one factory ) is not inconsistent with the activities of a major u . s . presidential election campaign , and it is therefore reasonable to question the identity of the customer ( s ) behind such orders . however , we \u2019 ve so far found no concrete <MASK> documenting who is responsible for these orders : merchandisers , the trump campaign itself , republican partisans , foreign entities , or some combination thereof .",

        "text": "so , if 1 / 3 of the <MASK> ( 17 ) do not cast their electoral college votes \u2013 then it goes to the house of representatives ( not the senate ) to elect the next president . <PARA> <MASK> : as generations of american school children have been taught in civics / government classes , although all eligible citizens throughout the united <MASK> may participate in the voting to select the person who shall hold the office of president of the united <MASK> , they do not directly elect the president . instead , the residents of each <MASK> vote for a slate of electors equal in number to the members of their <MASK> \u2019 s congressional delegation ; those electors ( currently 538 in number ) cast ballots designating their choice of candidate for the presidency ( a process known as the electoral college ), and whichever candidate receives a majority of those 538 electoral votes becomes president . if no candidate receives a majority of electoral votes , then the house of representatives votes to select a president from the top three candidates . the latter circumstance is quite rare , however : only twice in u . s . <MASK> , and not since 1824 , has the house of representatives been called upon to choose a president . <PARA> in november 2012 , wnd published an <MASK> (\u201c how obama can be stopped in electoral college \u201d) by judson phillips , founder of tea party nation , suggesting a way in which the electoral college process could be circumvented to prevent president obama \u2019 s re - election and instead install mitt romney as president : one - third of the <MASK> electors could simply refuse to cast electoral college ballots , thereby throwing the selection of the next president to the house of representatives . since republicans will control a majority of <MASK> delegations in the house during the next congress , surely they would vote to elect the republican candidate , mitt romney , over democrat barack obama : <PARA> according to the 12th amendment , for the electoral college to be able to select the president , it must have a quorum of two - thirds of the <MASK> voting . if enough <MASK> refuse to participate , the electoral college will not have a quorum . if the electoral college does not have a quorum or otherwise cannot vote or decide , then the responsibility for selecting the president and vice president devolves to the congress . <PARA> the house of representatives selects the president and the senate selects the vice president . <PARA> since the republicans hold a majority in the house , presumably they would vote for mitt romney , and the democrats in the senate would vote for joe biden for vice president . <PARA> can this work ? <PARA> sure it can . <PARA> the house of representatives selects the president and the senate selects the vice president . <PARA> since the republicans hold a majority in the house , presumably they would vote for mitt romney , and the democrats in the senate would vote for joe biden for vice president . <PARA> can this work ? <PARA> sure it can . <PARA> this <MASK> was poorly researched and flat out wrong , an erroneous assumption based upon a misreading of the 12th amendment which put the cart before the horse . <PARA> the 12th amendment to the constitution doesn \u2019 t <MASK> that congress \u201c must have a quorum of two - thirds of the <MASK> voting for the electoral college to be able to select the president .\u201d it directs <PARA> that if the selection of president has already devolved upon the house of representatives because no candidate received a majority of electoral votes , then \u201c a quorum consist [ ing ] of a member or members from two - thirds of the <MASK> \u201d is necessary before the house can begin to vote . in other words , the 12th amendment doesn \u2019 t say that electors from two - thirds of the <MASK> must participate in electoral college voting for the results to be valid ; it says that members of the house of representatives from two - thirds of the <MASK> have to be present in order to select a president if the electoral college has already failed to do so . <PARA> moreover , the scheme described above includes a couple of implicit errors . members of the house of representatives do not cast ballots individually for president ; they vote as part of <MASK> delegations , with each <MASK> having one vote . therefore , whichever party controls the majority of seats in the house is not guaranteed a victory in such a process ; what \u2019 s important is which party controls a majority of <MASK> delegations in the house . additionally , the current composition of the house is irrelevant , as the new congress to be seated in january 2013 would select a president if no candidate who ran in the november 2012 election received a majority of electoral votes . <PARA> it has happened from time to time that \u201c faithless \u201d electors have cast ballots for candidates other than the ones they were pledged to support in the electoral college ( although many are now prohibited from doing so by <MASK> laws ), but electors pledged to a losing candidate can \u2019 t do an end run around the electoral college process simply by refusing to vote at all .",
